  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence and print them in lex order. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, a subsequence is any sequence that can be derived by deleting some elements without changing the order. For example, for [1,2,3], the subsequences include the empty list, [1], [2], up to the full list.\n\nWait, the problem says to use a backtracking algorithm. Oh right, backtracking is a method where we build solutions step by step, by making choices and then undoing them if they don't lead to a solution. So for this problem, for each element, I can choose to include it or not in the current subsequence.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible combinations recursively? Let's think in terms of building subsets. For each element, the function would decide to take it or leave it. So for example, for the first element, we have two choices: include it and move forward, or skip it and move forward.\n\nWait, but since the list is ordered, the lex order matters. So the way we generate the subsequences must consider the order of elements. So perhaps during the backtracking process, to ensure the output is ordered correctly.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the output is ordered such that it's in lex order for all the possible subsets. So how are we generating it?\n\nLex order for the subsequences is important. For example, if the sequence is [1,2,3], the empty list comes first, then [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], then [2], etc. Looking at that, it's like the list starts with as many of the earlier elements as possible.\n\nSo the approach for backtracking would be to process the elements in order. For each element, we can either include it in the subsequence or not, ensuring that the decision points lead to generating the subsequences in lex order.\n\nHmm, maybe the way to structure the backtracking is to build each possible subsequence by considering the elements one by one, starting from the beginning. For each position in the sequence, we choose to include it or not, based on the current path.\n\nWait, but the empty subsequence needs to be considered as well. So I need to include that in the output.\n\nLet me think about the recursive approach. The function could take the current index and the current path. We start with index 0 and an empty path.\n\nFor each step, we can either include the current element or not.\n\nSo for the current index, if including it, we add it to the current path, and proceed to the next index. If not including, we proceed to the next index without adding it. Then, when we reach the end of the sequence, we output the current path.\n\nWait, but that approach would generate all possible combinations, but they may not be in lex order.\n\nWait no, because choosing to include the elements in order and handling each decision step at the current index would naturally result in the lex order. Because for the first element, each choice of including it or not affects the starting point of the subsequences.\n\nWait, maybe the recursively generated subsequences are already in lex order if we process the elements in order and make inclusion decisions as per the index.\n\nLet me test that idea.\n\nLet's say the sequence is [1,2,3].\n\nAt index 0 (element 1), the function can choose to include 1 or not.\n\nIf it includes 1, then the current path is [1]. The next decision is at index 1 (element 2): include it, then path becomes [1,2], then index 2, include 3, so [1,2,3], and so on.\n\nIf after including 1, at index 1, we don't include 2, move to index 2, then the choice is to include 3 or not. So that gives [1,3].\n\nAlternatively, not including 1 and including next elements would produce all the subsequences starting with 2 and 3.\n\nSo the order in which the function constructs the paths would be starting earlier indices, thus ensuring lex order.\n\nBut wait, is that the case? Because the function would first generate the empty subsequence, then the ones starting with 1, and then the others. How?\n\nNo, the way the empty subsequence is generated is at the end when all elements have been considered and none were selected.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: for backtracking, the initial call starts with index 0 and an empty path. So for each step, in the function, depending on whether we include the current element or not, we proceed.\n\nBut then, the first generated subsequence when the function reaches the end would be the empty path. Then, when including 3, then 2, etc.\n\nWait no. Because the function hasn't included any elements yet. Let me outline the process:\n\nAt index 0, include 1: proceed to index 1 and so on.\n\nAlternatively, don't include 1: move to index 1 and consider 2.\n\nSo the function at each decision point branches into two possibilities.\n\nWait, the base case is when index == n (length of the sequence). Then, the current path is added to the output.\n\nSo that means that all possible paths are explored, but the order in which they are added depends on the order of the choices. Including the current element may lead to deeper paths, which leads me to think that the subsequences that include the first element come before those that don't.\n\nSo the empty list may be generated last? Or maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is miscalibrated.\n\nLet me think: for the first element, say in [1,2,3].\n\nThe function for index 0, it can choose to include it or not.\n\nIf it does include, then it adds 1 to the path, and calls for index 1. Now, in index 1, again include 2 or not, and so on.\n\nIf it chooses not to include 3, then we proceed to index 2, and then to the base case, which appends [1,2] to the output, perhaps.\n\nWait not exactly. Let me outline the steps:\n\nWhen the function reaches the end (index = len(sequence)), it appends the current path to the results.\n\nSo, for [1,2,3], the function in the base case appends the current state.\n\nSo for the iterative steps:\n\nStart with index 0, path is empty.\n\nAt index 0, choose to include 1: call function for index 1 and path [1].\n\nAt index 1, choose to include 2: call function for index 2 and path [1,2].\n\nAt index 2, include 3: call index 3, path [1,2,3]. Now, index is beyond the length, so add [1,2,3] to result.\n\nThen backtrack. At index 2, function also has the choice not to include 3, so it adds [1,2] to the result.\n\nBacktracking to index 1, now without adding 3, but maybe loop again. Wait, maybe to think in terms of code: During the function's step, for each position, you first make a copy of the current path, add the current element, and proceed with the next index. Then return, backtrack, and proceed to not include the current element.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard approach is:\n\ndef backtrack(start, current):\n\n   if start == n: add current to the result.\n\n   else:\n\n      include the current element: add sequence[start] to current, recurse for start+1, then remove it.\n\n      not include it: recurse for start+1.\n\nWait, but this approach, which elements are handled in order?\n\nIn this code, the function would include elements in increasing order of their indices.\n\nSo for [1,2,3], the function would start with empty, and for each element, decide to include or not, but in the order of elements' appearance.\n\nSo the generated subsets would be ordered in the same way as the elements are processed.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem, the empty subset comes first. So according to the standard backtracking approach, when do we process the empty subset?\n\nHmm, let me consider.\n\nIn the function, each time we have a choice to include the current element or not. So the function builds subsets by choosing whether to take each element, in the order they appear.\n\nWait, for start=0, the decision is whether to take 1.\n\nSo when is the empty subset added? When the function reaches start = n, with an empty current path. So that's the case when, for all elements, the function chose not to include them.\n\nSo the function, for a given index, will process all subsets that can be formed by including elements up to that index.\n\nBut in terms of the order, when would the empty subset be generated?\n\nThe function would first process the cases where it does not include the first element, then proceeds to include other elements, but since the factors are all accounted for, the empty subset is the last one generated.\n\nWait no. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose the sequence is [1].\n\nAt index 0, the function has two choices:\n\n1. Include 1: then go to index 1. Since index 1 is beyond the list, [1] is added.\n\n2. Not include 1: proceed to index 1, then since index is beyond, [] is added.\n\nSo the order is:\n\nFirst, [1], then [].\n\nSo that would not match the example, because in the example, [] is the first output line.\n\nSo this approach would not produce the required order. The function's standard backtracking approach would generate the subsets in a particular order that doesn't match the lex order.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nBecause in the problem's example, the order is such that each subsequence starts as early as possible, then includes longer ones. But the standard backtracking approach isn't generating the subsets in lex order.\n\nWait, why? Let me think about the correct order.\n\nThe lex order for the outputs in the example is as follows:\n\nFirst comes the empty list.\n\nThen the subsets starting with 1, ordered by their length and elements.\n\nThen subsets starting with 2, then subsets starting with 3.\n\nWait no, in the example, the correct order is the empty list, followed by [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nIn lex order: the empty list is considered to be the first. Then, [1] comes first among all length-1 subsets, since 1 is the smallest. For two-element subsets, [1,2] comes before [1,3], because after 1, 2 is earlier than 3. Also, [1,2,3] comes before [1,3] in the example. Oh no, wait in the example, [1,2,3] is after [1,2] and before [1,3].\n\nSo in terms of lex order, the subsets are sorted as follows: the subsets are considered by their elements, starting from the first element, with earlier elements making the subset earlier in lex order to later elements. So for subsets of the same length, [1,2] comes before [1,3], and [2,3] comes after [1, anything]. So how do we generate this lex order via backtracking?\n\nOne approach could be that the way the function chooses to include elements in order, such that including the earliest element leads to more subsets being generated first.\n\nHmm. Another idea: Perhaps the correct approach is to sort the sequence first. For example, if the sequence is sorted, then considering each element in order while including or excluding would generate the subsets in lex order.\n\nIn the given example, the sequence is [1,2,3]. So sorted, it's the same.\n\nAnother test case: Suppose the sequence is [3,1,2]. If we process the elements in order, the generated subsets would be in lex order only if the elements are in sorted order.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires the output to be in lex order regardless of the sequence's initial order.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to sort the sequence first, then generate the subsets, which would then be in lex order.\n\nWait, maybe. For example, if the given sequence is [3,2,1], but we sort it before generating subsets.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't say that the function can modify the original sequence order. Oh, because in the example given, the output order is such that each subsequence is built in the original order of the elements of the sequence. So, for example, [1,3] comes after [1,2,3], but before [2].\n\nSo that suggests that the order of adding elements is based on the original sequence.\n\nWait, the lex order is determined by the order of the elements as per the original sequence. So, for subset comparison, compare element by element in the same positions, using the element's order as per the original sequence.\n\nSo, to ensure that the subsets are printed in lex order, the way to generate them is in a way that aligns with how lex order is determined.\n\nSo perhaps during the backtracking, the function is processing the elements in the order they appear, and for each possible inclusion, branching into including or excluding the element.\n\nWait, but the earlier problem of the empty set being generated after the subsets that include the first element suggests that this approach would cause the empty set to be last.\n\nWhich is not desired because in the example, it's the first output.\n\nSo that's a problem.\n\nHmm. How can I structure the backtracking so that the empty subset is considered before any subsets that include elements? Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the lex order is defined for the subsets.\n\nWait wait, lex order comparison: according to the way the subset is considered as a list. So the empty list is considered to come before any non-empty list because, lex order in programming usually treats it as such.\n\nIn the problem's example, [ ] is the first in the output. How do I ensure that the function produces the subsets in the correct order?\n\nSo perhaps the function needs to generate all subsets and then sort them lex order, but recursively generating them in the correct order is more complex.\n\nBut the problem says to generate them using backtracking, which suggests that we can't generate all subsets and then sort them, which might be a slower approach for large sequences (though N=10 is manageable).\n\nSo for a backtracking approach, perhaps the order in which the function explores the subsets should be adjusted so that it naturally produces the subsets in lex order.\n\nAnother idea: Generally, the subsets are generated in the order of choosing elements earlier in the sequence. So each decision in the backtracking considers the element at the current index and includes/excludes it.\n\nIn this way, the subsets that include earlier elements are generated before those that don't.\n\nBut in the case of the empty subset, which includes none of the elements, how is it generated.\n\nWait, perhaps the base case is when the current index is beyond the end. So, in the start of the function, the empty subset is a possible candidate.\n\nBut given the way the backtracking processes, the empty subset is generated only after all other subsets that include elements.\n\nWait, let me explain. For each index, the function makes two recursive calls: one including the current element, and another excluding it.\n\nThis way, the function will first explore all possibilities of including the current element before moving on to the case where it doesn't include it.\n\nWait no, usually, in the function, if you process including the element first, the subset with the element is added before the subset without it.\n\nSo in the initial call, for index 0.\n\nFirst, include 1, then move to index 1. After processing all subsets that include 1, the function returns to index 0 and excludes 1, moving to index 1 without including 1.\n\nThat would generate all subsets that include 1 before those that exclude 1, which are the latter.\n\nThus, subsets with 1 would appear before subsets without 1.\n\nBut the empty subset is a subset without 1. So it would be generated after all subsets that include 1 and their subsets.\n\nSo in the example given, the empty subset would be generated after [3], making it the last in the output. This doesn't match the given example.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the backtracking approach, as described, would generate the subsets in an order where the empty subset is the last one, but in the example, it's the first.\n\nSo how can I make the empty subset be generated first?\n\nPerhaps, the function should first process excluding the current element, then including it.\n\nWait, if the function reverses the order of the decisions: during the recursive calls, first exclude the current element, then include it.\n\nSo the steps would be: for the element at current index, first make a recursive call that doesn't include it, then make a call that does include it.\n\nThis way, in the initial step, index 0, the function would first process excluding 1, moving to index 1, which would process excluding 2, then move to index 2, process excluding 3, reach the end, resulting in the empty subset being added first.\n\nThen, for each index, the function returns and includes the current element, thus building subsets that include it and whatever was included after.\n\nSo this change in decision order would generate all subsets starting with not including the element, which includes the empty subset early.\n\nSo this approach would produce the subsets in the desired lex order.\n\nSo, for the given problem, perhaps the order of the recursive calls in the backtracking should be: first process without the element, then process with the element.\n\nThis way, the empty subset is the first generated, followed by the subsets that include the last possible element, then the others.\n\nWait, let me test this for [1,2,3].\n\nThe function for index 0 first processes excluding 1: call index 1 without 1.\n\nAt index 1, exclude 2: call index 2 without 2.\n\nAt index 2, exclude 3: base case, add the empty subset.\n\nThen backtrack to index 2: include 3.\n\nSo add [3].\n\nThen backtrack to index 2 again? Or wait, how does the function process including 3 after that?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to outline the steps.\n\nLet's think of the process.\n\nApproach: in each step, first exclude the current element, then include it.\n\nSo step by step for [1,2,3]:\n\n1. Start at index 0, path=[].\n\n2. In function, first exclude 1, call function with index=1.\n\n3. At index=1, exclude 2, call function with index=2.\n\n4. At index=2: exclude 3, call function with index=3.\n\n5. Base case: add path=[] to the output.\n\n6. Return to index=2. Now, include 3, path becomes [3], call with index=3.\n\n7. Base case: add [3].\n\n8. Return, so index=2, path is to be popped back to empty or previous.\n\n9. Return to index=1: now, after excluding 2, proceed to include it, so path becomes [2], call index=2.\n\n10. At index=2: first exclude 3, call index=3, add [2].\n\n11. Then include 3, call index=3, add [2,3].\n\n12. Return, and pop 3.\n\n13. Now, index=1's function finishes.\n\n14. Back to index=0: now, proceed to include 1.\n\n15. path becomes [1], call index=1.\n\n16. At index=1, first exclude 2, call index=2.\n\n17. At index=2, first exclude 3: call index=3, add [1].\n\n18. Then include 3: add [1,3].\n\n19. Return to index=2, pop.\n\n20. At index=1: include 2, path becomes [1,2].\n\n21. call index=2, first exclude 3, which adds [1,2].\n\n22. Then include 3, which adds [1,2,3].\n\n23. Return to index=1, pop.\n\n24. Return to index=0, pop 1.\n\nSo the output order is:\n\n[] \n[3]\n[2]\n[2,3]\n[1]\n[1,3}\n[1,2}\n[1,2,3}\n\nWait but the expected order is different.\n\nIn the example, the expected order is:\n\n[]\n[1]\n[1, 2]\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 3]\n[2]\n[2, 3]\n[3]\n\nSo the order I get with the above approach is:\n\n- first []\n- then [3], [2], [2,3], [1], [1,3], [1,2], [1,2,3}.\n\nBut in the example, it's:\n\n[], [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3}, [2], [2,3}, [3}.\n\nHmm, so it's different. So the current approach of processing exclude first may not be producing the correct order.\n\nWhat's the difference here: the function in the first approach is generating the [3] subset before the [2], which is before [1] subsets. But in the expected output, the [1] subsets come before [2] and [3}.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nThen, perhaps this approach of exclude first doesn't solve the problem.\n\nSo what else can I do?\n\nAnother idea: Sort the sequence before processing? But that would change the order of the original sequence, leading to incorrect subsets.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the subsequences in lex order. So the order of the elements in the subsets is the same as the original sequence, but the lex order of the entire subset list is considered.\n\nSo, for a given sequence [a, b, c], a is the first element, then b, then c.\n\nThus, for the generated subsets, [] comes first, then any subset that starts with a, ordered by including more elements in the order of the sequence. After that, any subset starting with b, etc.\n\nThus, the function's approach must process factors by the order of elements: for each position in the sequence, decide whether to include it or not, and thus the subsets that start with the earlier elements come before those that start with later.\n\nSo the correct approach is to process the elements in the order of the original sequence, but ensure that the subsets are generated in lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard approach where we include the current element first, then exclude it. Then, the empty subset is the last.\n\nBut that is not compatible with the example.\n\nHmm. So perhaps, we need to generate all subsets and then sort them, but the problem requires using backtracking and printing them in order.\n\nSo maybe, the function can generate all subsets, collect them, then sort them, and then print. However, the constraint says that the function should run efficiently for N up to 10, which is manageable.\n\nBut this approach would be O(2^N log 2^N) which for N=10 is acceptable, as 2^10 is 1024, and 1024 log 1024 is manageable.\n\nSo, considering this, perhaps in the code, for the function:\n\n- Use backtracking to generate all possible subsets, in any order.\n\n- Collect the subsets in a list.\n\n- Sort the list in the correct lex order.\n\n- Print each subset.\n\nBut the problem states that the function should use a backtracking algorithm. So, maybe that approach is acceptable as it still uses backtracking.\n\nWait, but backtracking is just for traversing the possibilities, storing them or not, really. So in this case, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says, 'print each subsequence in a separate line' in lex order, not return a list.\n\nSo another approach is to generate all subsets, then sort them, then print.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement a function that uses backtracking to collect all possible subsets of the given sequence, then sort them in lex order, and then print each on a new line.\n\nBut the function needs to collect the subsets, sort them, and print.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Generate all possible subsets of the sequence, using backtracking. Each subset is built as a list.\n\n2. Collect all the subsets into a list of lists.\n\n3. Sort this list lex order.\n\n4. Print each subset in the sorted order, each on a new line.\n\nSo how to generate all subsets with backtracking.\n\nThe classic method is to have a function that adds the current element and proceeds, or not.\n\nBut in how to manage the subsets, in the code.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nInitialize a result list.\n\nDefine a helper function that tracks the current index and the current path.\n\nWhenever the helper function's index exceeds the length of the sequence, it appends the current path to the result.\n\nElse, for the current index, either include the element or not.\n\nBut for Lexicographic order, we can generate all, collect, then sort.\n\nBut what is the lex order for the subsets?\n\nIn Python, the default sort of lists is lex order. So [1,2] < [1,3], etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, comparing two lists in Python:\n\n>>> [1] < [2]\nTrue\n>>> [1,2] < [1,3]\nTrue\n>>> [] < [1]\nTrue\n\nThus, adding all the subsets into a list and then calling sorted() will give the correct order.\n\nSo, the function could:\n\n- Use backtracking to collect all possible subsets.\n\n- Sort them.\n\n- Print each.\n\nNow, implementing that in code.\n\nFirst, the function to generate all subsets.\n\nIn the helper function:\n\nWe can write a helper that, given the start index and current path, appends to the result when the start index is beyond the end.\n\nAlternatively, for a non-recursive approach, but as the problem requires a backtracking algorithm, recursion is expected.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nresult = []\n\ndef backtrack(start, current_path):\n    if start == len(sequence):\n        result.append(current_path.copy())\n        return\n    # include the current element\n    current_path.append(sequence[start])\n    backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n    current_path.pop()\n    # exclude the current element\n    backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n\nInitially, call backtrack(0, []).\n\nBut wait, what's the difference between including the current element and then excluding, or the other way around. Does this affect the order in which subsets are generated?\n\nBut regardless, since we are collecting all subsets and then sorting them, the initial order doesn't matter.\n\nOnce all subsets are collected, the function can sort them.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    result = []\n    n = len(sequence)\n    def backtrack(start, current_path):\n        if start == n:\n            result.append(current_path.copy())\n            return\n        # include the current element\n        current_path.append(sequence[start])\n        backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n        current_path.pop()\n        # exclude\n        backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n    backtrack(0, [])\n    # Now, sort the result lexicographically.\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    # print each subset in separate line\n    for subset in sorted_result:\n        print(subset)\n\nWait, but the problem's example has the subsets printed without the commas, like [1, 2, 3}, but when you print a list in Python, it uses the comma. So for consistency, the output should be the same as in the example.\n\nWait, in the sample provided:\n\nOutput is each subset as a list. So, in the code, each subset is a list, and when you print it, it's displayed with commas and brackets.\n\nSo the code above will generate the correct format.\n\nTesting this code with the sample [1,2,3], the function will collect all subsets, sort them, then print.\n\nWait, for the sample, the expected output is seven subsets, including the empty and all possible combinations.\n\nWhat would be the result of backtracking in this case:\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor [1,2,3], the code should collect all possible subsets:\n\n- []: empty list.\n\n- [1], [2], [3]\n\n- [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]\n\n- [1,2,3]\n\nThen, the function should sort them.\n\nWhen we sort them, what order is achieved?\n\nThe sorted function will arrange the lists as per lex order.\n\nBut the empty list comes first, followed by the single elements in order of their occurrence. Then the two-element subsets in which the first element comes earlier, and for the same first element, the second is earlier.\n\nYes, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo when the code prints the sorted list, it should produce the expected output.\n\nTesting the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the sorted function will arrange the subsets correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, for the test case, does this code generate all possible subsets?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this should solve the problem.\n\nBut wait, what about for other cases, like a sequence with elements in a different order, like [3,2,1]?\n\nIn that case, the function would generate all subsets, then sort them, giving the empty list first, then [1], [2], etc., according to their sorted order.\n\nBut No.\n\nWait, the sorted() function will sort each subset, but the lex order of the subsets as per their own elements.\n\nWait, in this case, for a sequence [3,2,1], the subsets would be generated, but the sorted function in the code would arrange them based on the subset's own elements.\n\nWait, in the 'sorted(result)', it's sorting the list of subsets as if they are lists. So, for example, the subset [3] is considered as larger than [2], which is larger than [1}.\n\nThus, the sorted function will order the subsets as expected, matching the problem's requirement.\n\nAlternatively, it depends on the actual order of the elements in the subsets.\n\nWait, if the original sequence is [3,2,1], the subsets like [3] will be considered after subsets like [2,3], because the first element in [2,3} is 2, which is smaller than 3.\n\nSo the sorted function is not just checking the first element; it's performing a lex order comparison.\n\nThus, the code will indeed generate the output in the correct lex order.\n\nSo in conclusion, the approach is to first collect all subsets using backtracking, then sort them, then print each on a new line.\n\nThus, the code I outlined earlier should solve the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence of integers using a backtracking algorithm. The subsequences should then be printed in lexicographical order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: We use a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsequences. For each element in the sequence, we make two choices: include the element in the current subsequence or exclude it. This approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of elements.\n2. **Collect Subsequences**: During the backtracking process, we collect all generated subsequences into a list.\n3. **Sorting**: After collecting all subsequences, we sort them lexicographically. Python's default list sorting mechanism sorts lists lexicographically, which makes this step straightforward.\n4. **Output**: Finally, we print each sorted subsequence in a new line.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints all possible subsequences of the given sequence using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \n    :param sequence: A list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    n = len(sequence)\n    \n    def backtrack(start, current_path):\n        if start == n:\n            result.append(current_path.copy())\n            return\n        # Include the current element\n        current_path.append(sequence[start])\n        backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n        current_path.pop()\n        # Exclude the current element\n        backtrack(start + 1, current_path)\n    \n    backtrack(0, [])\n    \n    # Sort the result lexicographically\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    \n    # Print each subsequence\n    for subset in sorted_result:\n        print(subset)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is a recursive helper function that explores all possible subsequences. It takes the current index and the current path (subsequence being built). For each index, it includes the element at that index and recursively continues to the next index. After returning from the recursive call, it removes the last added element to explore the exclusion of the current element.\n2. **Collecting Results**: Each time the end of the sequence is reached (i.e., `start == n`), the current subsequence is added to the result list.\n3. **Sorting**: The collected subsequences are sorted lexicographically to ensure the output is in the correct order.\n4. **Printing**: Each sorted subsequence is printed on a new line.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates all possible subsequences and ensures they are printed in the required lexicographical order.",
