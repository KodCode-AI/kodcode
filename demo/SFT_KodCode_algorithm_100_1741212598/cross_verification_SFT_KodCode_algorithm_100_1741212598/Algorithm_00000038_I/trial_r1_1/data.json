  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence using backtracking. Hmm, the function should print each subsequence on a new line, and they should be in lex order.\n\nWait, wait, what's a subsequence? Oh right, a subsequence is any sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order. So for example, [1,3] is a valid subsequence of [1,2,3].\n\nSo, my task is to generate all possible such subsequences. And I must use backtracking to do this.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this with backtracking. In backtracking, we usually build the solution step by step, making choices and exploring possibilities, then undoing them if it doesn't lead to a solution.\n\nSo, in this case, for each element in the sequence, I can choose to include it in the current subsequence or not. That choice leads to building different subsequences.\n\nWait, but how to structure the recursion. Maybe for each index in the sequence, I can decide whether to include it or not. Starting from index 0.\n\nI think recursion would look something like this: at each step, I pick the current index, and I have two choices: include the element at that index or exclude it. Excluding it moves to the next index, but including it adds it to the current path and moves to the next index as well.\n\nBut wait, for example, the initial step is the element at position 0. Then, when including it, I can proceed to the next position and choose to include/exclude that element.\n\nWait, but for the backtracking function, perhaps we can pass along the current index and the current path, and for the next step, increment the index.\n\nBut for better results, maybe we need to sort the sequence first. Oh wait, the output needs to be in lex order. So, the way the function appends subsequences affects the order. Hmm, perhaps the initial approach needs to consider this.\n\nWait, the sample input is [1,2,3], the output is given as starting with the empty list, then ones starting with 1, then 2, etc.\n\nWait, the lex order for the example is such that the empty list comes first. Then, [1], then [1,2], etc. So in general, the lex order of the subsequences is determined as follows: when comparing two subsequences, the one with the smaller element at the first differing position comes first. For example, [2] comes after [1], because 2>1. [1,3] comes before [2], because 1<2.\n\nSo to generate the subsequences in lex order, perhaps the original sequence should be sorted first? Hmm, but let's look at the sample input: [1,2,3]. That's already in order. The output has the subsequences in lex order. But what if the sequence isn't sorted? For example, [3,2,1], would the generated subsequences be printed in the lex order based on the sorted version or the original order?\n\nWait the problem statement says that the output should be in lex order. So regardless of the input, the generated subsequences should be in lex order.\n\nSo perhaps, before processing, we need to sort the sequence. Or during the generation process, the elements are considered in a way that allows us to build subsequences in lex order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process of generating the subsequences in lex order can be achieved by processing the elements in a sorted fashion.\n\nWait, but if the input is [3,1,2], then the lex order of the subsequences may not match if you process elements as given. So I think the first step is to sort the sequence, so that when building the subsequences, they naturally come in the correct order.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample, the input is in order, and the output is the lex order.\n\nWait, let's suppose the input is [2,1,3]. Then what? How would the output look?\n\nThe subsequences would include [], [2], [2,1 is not possible because subsequences must maintain order. So the elements must be in the same order as they appear in the original sequence.\n\nAh, right, because a subsequence has to maintain the original order of elements. So, for a sequence like [2,1,3], the possible subsequences are:\n\n[]\n[2], [2,1], [2,1,3], [2,3]\n[1], [1,3]\n[3]\n\nBut in lex order, these would be arranged as the empty list, then [1], [1,3], [2], [2,1], [2,1,3], [2,3], [3].\n\nWait no, lex order is comparing the sequences. So, to compare two sequences, you look at the first element that differs. Let's see.\n\nWhat's [1] vs [2,1]. Wait, [1] is shorter than [2,1], and in lex order, the comparison is done element-wise up to the minimum length. So first element: 1 < 2? So [1] comes before [2,1]. So in lex order for the example [2,1,3], the output would list all subsequences starting with elements in the sorted order.\n\nWait no, that's not accurate. Because each subsequence is a list that follows the original order of the array. So for the initial array [2,1,3], the possible elements in subsequences are in the order they are in the array.\n\nBut for the lex order of the subsequences, it's considering the elements as a sequence. So when comparing two subsequences a and b:\n\n- Compare the first elements of a and b. If a's element is smaller, a comes first.\n- If elements are equal, proceed to the next element in each.\n- If one is a prefix of the other, the shorter one comes first.\n\nSo yes, in lex order for the initial array, [1] comes before [2]. So the output in my earlier example would have [1] before [2].\n\nBut the problem is, if the initial sequence is not sorted, how can I generate the subsequences in such a way that the output is in lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to consider all possible subsequences (without sorting), which would include [2], [2,1], [1], etc., but then for the output to be in lex order, we need to generate all of them and then sort.\n\nBut generating all of them and then sorting would be possible but may be less efficient than generating them in lex order to begin with.\n\nWait, but for n=10, the total number of subsequences is 2^10 = 1024, which is manageable. So perhaps for n=10, it's acceptable to generate all possible subsequences, collect them, sort them, and then print.\n\nYes, that's a possible approach.\n\nBut the problem requires implementing a backtracking approach. So perhaps the backtracking approach can be modified to generate the elements in lex order, but without using sorting as a separate step.\n\nWait, how?\n\nAlternatively, the element order in the backtracking could be such that we process the elements in the order of the array, but with some intelligence to allow for lex order.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if the original array isn't sorted, including elements in the order they appear may not yield the lex order of the results.\n\nSo perhaps the better approach is to generate all the possible subsequences and then sort them lexicographically.\n\nSo steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Generate all possible subsequences of the given sequence.\n\n2. Sort them lexicographically.\n\n3. Print each in order.\n\nBut how to generate all possible subsequences.\n\nAlternatively, if the backtracking approach can be structured such that it explores the elements in lex order, then the generated subsequences can be printed as they are found, thus automatically appearing in lex order.\n\nWait, for that, during the backtracking process, each step should choose the next smallest element. But this requires that the elements are processed in a certain order.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is:\n\n- At each step in the backtracking, process the elements in the sequence in a sorted manner. But then, since the elements are added in order, the subsequences would be built in lex order. But that may not work because the original sequence must be considered in the order that they appear when building the subsequences.\n\nWait, for example, the sequence is [3,1,2]. Then, during backtracking, if I process in sorted order (1,2,3), the resulting subsequence [1, 2] is possible because those elements are in the original order as [1] comes before [2] in the sequence.\n\nWait no, in [3,1,2], the element 1 is in position 1, and 2 is in position 2. So including 1 and 2 in a subsequence would need to include 1 before 2. So during the backtracking, for the given sequence, choosing whether to include elements at each index in order, but the way the next elements are chosen could affect the lex order of the generated subsequences.\n\nHmm, perhaps the backtracking function should consider all possible elements, but in such a way that the choices are made in order. Maybe by ensuring that the elements are considered in the order that would lead to lex smallest first.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is as follows:\n\nSort the original sequence. Then, use the backtracking approach to explore in the order of the sorted sequence. That way, the generated subsequences are built in lex order.\n\nBut wait, that could break the required order for subsequences because the length and order may vary.\n\nWait no, for example, if the original sequence is [3,1,2]. Sorted sequence is [1,2,3]. The backtracking approach would generate all subsequences from the sorted list: [], [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nBut the actual subsequences in the original sequence [3,1,2] are different. So this approach would be incorrect, since the elements must remain in their original order in the generated subsequences.\n\nOh right, that's a crucial point. So the generated subsequences must respect the order in the original sequence. That means, for [3,1,2], the subsequence [3,2] is not allowed, because 2 comes after 1 in the original list.\n\nWait wait no, in [3,1,2], the elements can be taken as, for example, index 0, 2: which gives 3,2, forming the subsequence [3,2], which is allowed since 3 comes before 2 in the original sequence.\n\nSo the order must be preserved; that is, a subsequence can't have elements in a different order than the original. So the way we process the elements must be in the order of their indices.\n\nBut to generate the subsequences in lex order, perhaps the initial array needs to be sorted.\n\nWait, but for example, if the array is [2,1,3], the output would need to include all subsequences in lex order, which is determined by their elements in order.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible subsequences, but in the process, generate them in lex order by sorting the initial array.\n\nWait, but that wouldn't work because the original array's order must be preserved.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nAlternative approach: generate all possible subsequences, collect them in a list, then sort that list in lex order, then print them.\n\nThat approach seems manageable, especially since the constraints allow for n=10, which is 2^10=1024 subs, which is tiny.\n\nYes, that could work.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Implement a backtracking algorithm to collect all possible subsequences.\n\n- Once all are collected, sort them in lex order.\n\n- Then, print them, each on a new line.\n\nWait, but how to collect all possible subsequences.\n\nAlternative, the backtracking can build each subsequence, and collect them into a list. Once done, sort, then print.\n\nSo in code, the function could generate all possible subsequences via backtracking, adding each to a list. Then, sort that list.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the example in the problem statement, [1,2,3]. The backtracking would generate the list as follows:\n\nAfter generation, the list would have 8 elements, including the empty list and all other possible combinations.\n\nThen, we need to sort this list.\n\nAfter sorting, the order is as given in the example.\n\nBut wait, in the sample, the first element is [1]. When the list is empty, it comes before [1]?\n\nWait, no. Wait the empty list is the first. Then [1], then [1,2], etc.\n\nWait, the empty list is the first, then the single element lists in order, but in lex order, what is the order between empty list and [3], for example.\n\nWait, the empty list comes before [3], because in Python, when comparing a list to another, the empty list is considered smaller.\n\nSo when we sort the list, the empty list will be first.\n\nYes, as per the sample.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nIn the function, perform a backtracking approach that builds all possible subsequences (including the empty subsequence), collect them in a list, then sort this list, then print each in order.\n\nSo first, the backtracking function.\n\nHow to implement this.\n\nThe backtrack function would typically take parameters such as the current index, and the current path (subsequence being built).\n\nAt each step, for each element, the function decides to include it or not, and proceeds.\n\nWait, but when the function is called recursively, including elements from the next index onwards.\n\nSo for example, for the sequence [a, b, c], the first index is 0 (a), where we can choose to include a or not. If we include a, the next call is with index 1, current path [a]. Then the function has the option to include b or not, etc.\n\nSo for each element, at index i, the function can include it, then proceed to next index; or not include it and proceed.\n\nSo the code for the backtracking would initiate with the initial index (maybe 0), and an empty current path.\n\nWait, but for the empty subsequence, the index would be 0, and the path is empty, but how is that handled.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start with index 0 and current path empty. Then, for each possible subsequence, as we iterate through the elements.\n\nAlternatively, the function could:\n\ndef backtrack(start, path):\n    for each element in the sequence starting from 'start':\n        add element to path, add a copy of the new path to the list of subsequences, then recursively call backtrack with next start, and then remove the element from path.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Let's think.\n\nWait perhaps the general approach for generating subsets is similar to this.\n\nWait, for example, the standard way to generate all subsets (subsequences) of an array is as follows:\n\nThe function takes the start index and the current path.\n\nAt each step, for each i from start to end:\n\n- include arr[i] in the current path, add this path as a new subset.\n\n- recursively call the function with i+1 to process the next elements.\n\nBut in our case, each time you add a subset, you also need to collect it in the list.\n\nWait, but this approach for generating subsequences includes each combination where elements are added in the order of the array, thus giving all possible non-empty subsets. But it also lacks the empty subset. So after collecting all, we can add the empty subset to the list.\n\nWait, no. Because in the current function, including arr[i] gives subsets that have the element, but the initial empty subset is not included. So perhaps the initial call should be with start=0, and path empty. Then, before starting the loop, we can add a copy of the path (which is empty) to the list.\n\nAlternatively, after the initial step, we can generate all possible non-empty subsets, then add the empty subset.\n\nBut how is that handled.\n\nWait, perhaps in each function call, as soon as path is built, it's added to the list. So initial call is:\n\nbacktrack(0, [])\n\nIn the function backtrack(start, path):\n\n    add the current path to the list\n    for i in range(start, len(sequence)):\n        add sequence[i] to path\n        backtrack(i+1, path)\n        remove sequence[i] from path\n\nWait, that's not right because in this way, the empty path is added before any elements. Then, for each element, the path becomes [arr[i]], and it adds it, then proceeds to explore further.\n\nBut this approach includes all possible subsets because each possible combination is built in the order of their first element.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, for the sample input, the function would generate the non-empty subsets, but perhaps something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the function when called as backtrack(0, []):\n\n- adds the empty list to the output.\n\n- then, in the loop, for i=0, adds 1 to path.\n\n- then, calls backtrack(1, [1]).\n\nIn this function:\n\n- add [1] to output.\n\n- loops i from 1 to 2.\n\n- i=1: add 2 to path \u2192 [1,2] \u2192 call backtrack(2, [1,2]).\n\nIn that call:\n\n- add [1,2] to output.\n\n- loops i from 2 to 2.\n\n- i=2: add 3 \u2192 [1,2,3] \u2192 call backtrack(3, [1,2,3]), which does nothing except adding [1,2,3] to output.\n\nAfter returning, backtrack(2) removes the 3.\n\nThen, returns to backtrack(1), which removes the 2.\n\ni increments to 2, adds 3 to [1], makes path [1,3], adds it to the output, then calls backtrack(3, which adds [1,3], then returns.\n\nThen, after all, backtrack(0) removes 1.\n\nThen, i increments to 1, in backtrack(0):\n\n Adds 2 to the path, which is now [2], adds to output.\n\n Calls backtrack(1, [2]), which adds [2], then in its loop, i starts at 1.\n\nIn that, it adds 1 \u2192 [2,1], which is a problem because in the original sequence, 1 is after 2. But in this case, the path would be [2,1], which is a valid subsequence of [1,2,3], but in this scenario, the function is adding [2,1], which is correct. Wait no, the original array is [1,2,3], so [2,1] is not a valid subsequence because 2 comes after 1 in the array.\n\nWait wait, the function's backtracking is building the path by adding elements in the order of the array, but when sequence is [1,2,3], adding 2 then 1 is not possible since in the array, 1 comes before 2. So in this scenario, when in the original array, I would never reach a situation where the function adds 2 and then 1.\n\nWait no. Let me think. If the array is [1,2,3], and the function is at position i=0 (value 1), it adds 1, then proceeds to i=1 (2), then i=2 (3). Then returns, back to i=0. It then tries i=1 and adds 2, then i=2, adds 3, then back to i=1, proceeds etc.\n\nIn no case does the function generate a subsequence that includes 2 before 1, because 1 is at index 0, and 2 at index 1. So any subsequence that includes both will have 1 before 2.\n\nSo the function is correct in building only valid subsequences.\n\nThen, for the sample input, this function, when i makes it through the entire process, would generate all possible non-empty subsets, including [2], [3], [2,3], [1,2], etc., but it starts by adding the empty subset.\n\nWait, in our earlier code plan, the function adds the empty subset first, and then processes the elements, adding the subsets via adding each possible element.\n\nBut for the sample, the function would output the empty subset first, and then all the others.\n\nIn the sample, the output starts with [], so the function would generate that correctly.\n\nBut wait, is the order in which the subsets are generated correct for the lex order? Probably not, because after the empty set comes [1], which is correct, but in the function, after the empty set, the next added subset is [1], then [1,2], etc., but for the other subsets, such as [2], which comes after [1], the function may generate them in the order that includes everything after adding 2, but perhaps not in the correct lex order.\n\nBut in the function, the recursion is processing the subsets in the order where each subset is built by adding the elements in the order of the array. This means that the subsets are being added in the order of their starting element.\n\nBut perhaps this approach doesn't directly give the subsets in lex order.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to generate all subsets, regardless of order, then sort them lex and print them.\n\nSo I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nIn the function, I can collect all the possible subsequences, including the empty one.\n\nThen, I can sort the list of subsequences.\n\nThen, print each.\n\nSo now, to implement this.\n\nThe backtracking step:\n\nLet's create a helper function that collects all subsequences.\n\nInitialize a list to collect the subsequences, e.g., result = [].\n\nThen, in the backtracking function, for each possible path, add a copy of the current path to the result list.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    result = []\n    def backtrack(start, current_path):\n        # Add the current path to result\n        result.append(current_path.copy())\n        for i in range(start, len(sequence)):\n            # Include the i-th element\n            current_path.append(sequence[i])\n            # Recurse\n            backtrack(i + 1, current_path)\n            # Undo\n            current_path.pop()\n    backtrack(0, [])\n    # Now, sort the result in lex order\n    result.sort()\n    # Print each\n    for subseq in result:\n        print(subseq)\n\nWait, but in this code, the empty list is included (current_path is [] when backtracking is called with start=0 and an empty current_path). Then, in the loop, the elements are added in the order of the array. So for the sample input, the empty list comes first, then [1], then [1,2], etc.\n\nBut the problem's sample expects the order after the empty list to be [1], [1,2], etc., which is indeed the lex order.\n\nBut when we call sort, the lex order is based on the original list. So the result list, after being sorted, will have [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3], followed by [].\n\nWait, no. Python's list comparison is lex order.\n\nSo comparing two lists, the shorter list is considered smaller if it is a prefix of another.\n\nFor example, [] is smaller than [1], which is smaller than [1,2], etc. So when the result list is sorted after collection, [] comes first, then [1], then [1,3), then, no wait.\n\nWait, for the sample, the function would generate the following order:\n\nAfter backtracking:\n\nThe result is generated as follows:\n\n- Initially, add empty list.\n\nthen, i=0 adds 1, then in backtrack calls, which add [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3].\n\nThen, backtrack returns, and i increments to 1, adds 2, then in backtrack adds [2], [2,3].\n\nThen, i increments to 2, adds 3, adds [3].\n\nSo the result list before sorting is:\n\n[[], [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3]]\n\nWait wait, let's recount.\n\nFirst, backtrack(0, []):\n\nappends empty list \u2192 result is [ [] ]\n\nloop i from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0:\n\nadd 1 to current_path \u2192 [1]\n\ncall backtrack(1, [1])\n\nIn this call:\n\nstart = 1, current_path = [1]\n\nappends [1] to result \u2192 result becomes [ [], [1] ]\n\nthen i runs from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1: add 2 \u2192 [1,2]. call backtrack(2, [1,2].\n\nIn that call, start=2.\n\nappends [1,2] \u2192 result becomes [...] [1,2].\n\nthen i=2, add 3 \u2192 [1,2,3]. call backtrack(3, [1,2,3], which appends it and returns.\n\ni stops. backtrack returns.\n\nback in backtrack(1, [1,2]) (after i=1 and 2), i increments to 2.\n\nadd 3 \u2192 [1,3], call backtrack(3, [1,3]). appends this to result.\n\nreturn, backtrack returns.\n\ncurrent_path is now [1] again, after popping 3 and 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after the first recursion for i=0, in the initial backtrack function, i=0's addition leads through a series of backtracks.\n\nBut perhaps the more precise way is to think that after each addition, the function appends the path.\n\nSo the process for empty and [1], [1,2], etc., via the function's process, the generated result list is in the order I mentioned earlier.\n\nWait the result list, before any sorting, for the sample input [1,2,3], would be:\n\n[ [],\n  [1],\n[1,2],\n[1,2,3],\n[1,3],\n[2],\n[2,3],\n[3] ]\n\nBecause in the code, the recursive calls process each element starting at i=0, then for each, their sub-elements.\n\nWait, in the way the code is written, the initial call appends the empty list to the result.\n\nThen, for i=0, 1 is added and current_path becomes [1]. Then, in the next call, [1] is added to the result. Then, processing i=1, 2 is added, current_path becomes [1,2], which is added to the result, etc.\n\nSo after all backtracking, the result list is:\n\nempty, [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nWait no, because when the initial call appends the empty list, then for i=0, element 1 is added to current path, then it calls backtrack(1, [1]) which appends [1], while in the loop, i=0.\n\nWait, that function will then process all the next possible additions.\n\nSo after the initial call to backtrack: the empty is added, then the loop processes i=0.\n\nIn the first iteration of the loop in the initial call:\n\ncurrent_path is [1];\n\nthen, in backtrack(1, [1]), which appends [1] to result.\n\nThen, in the loop, i=1 and i=2 are processed for the sequence.\n\nSimilarly, this will generate subsets in a depth-first manner.\n\nSo when the backtracking completes, the initial result list, before sorting, would be in the order of depth-first generation.\n\nSo the order in the result list would be:\n\nempty list\n\n[1]\n\n[1,2]\n\n[1,2,3]\n\n[1,3]\n\n[2]\n\n[2,3]\n\n[3]\n\nBut when the code then does result.sort(), it will arrange them in lex order, which for the sample is the same as the current order of the result list except that the empty list is first.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is:\n\n[]\n\n[1]\n\n[1, 2]\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n[1, 3]\n\n[2]\n\n[2, 3]\n\n[3]\n\nWhich is exactly the order that the result list would have after the backtracking. So in this case, the result.sort() is sorting the list in the correct order, but in this case, the result already is in the correct order, so no change.\n\nWait, but wait.\n\nAt the end of the function, the code calls result.sort(). So regardless of the order in which the result list is built, it gets sorted. So for the sample, after this, the order is correct.\n\nBut what about for the general case?\n\nWait, let's say the sequence was [3,1,2]. The backtracking approach would generate all possible subsequences, including the empty list, then [3], [3,1], [3,1,2}, [3,2}, [1}, [1,2}, [2}.\n\nSo the result list before sorting is:\n\n[\n [],\n [3], \n [3,1], \n [3,1,2],\n [3,2], \n [1], \n [1,2], \n [2], \n ]\n\nBut when sorted, the lex order would be:\n\n[] \n[1] \n[1,2] \n[2] \n[3] \n[3,1] (but wait: no, [3] comes after [2}, right?)\n\nWait comparing [3] and [3,1]. In lex order, [3] is shorter than [3,1] but the first element is same (3). But which is considered smaller? Since the first elements are equal, move to the next. The first has no next element, the second has 1. So [3] comes before [3,1], because [3] is a prefix of [3,1} but shorter.\n\nWait, in Python, when you compare [3] and [3,1], [3] is considered smaller because it doesn't have a second element, making it 'less than' in lex order.\n\nSo the sorted result should be:\n\n[\n [],\n [1], \n [1, 2], \n [2], \n [3], \n [3, 1], \n [3, 1, 2], \n [3, 2], \n ]\n\nSo when the initial function runs without sorting, the result is in the order I mentioned before. After the sort, it's now in lex order.\n\nSo the code should proceed with generating all the subsequences, then sorting them.\n\nSo the current approach is:\n\nCollect all possible subsequences, which respects the order of the elements in the original sequence.\n\nThen, sort the collected list in lex order.\n\nThen, print each.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nInitialize the result list, call the backtrack function, then sort, then print.\n\nSo the code structure would be as written earlier.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you sort a list of lists, the default sort is lex order, which is element-wise comparison.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code:\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(start, current_path):\n        result.append(current_path.copy())\n        for i in range(start, len(sequence)):\n            current_path.append(sequence[i])\n            backtrack(i + 1, current_path)\n            current_path.pop()\n    \n    backtrack(0, [])\n    result.sort()\n    for subseq in result:\n        print(subseq)\n\nWait, but in this code, the initial call to backtrack(0, []) appends [].\n\nThen, in the loop for i from 0 to len(sequence)-1.\n\nBut wait, the element adds in the order i=0: adds sequence[0], then i=0 in the initial function calls causes the entire recursion.\n\nThen, i=1, adds sequence[1], etc.\n\nSo when the initial function backtracks, the result list has all possible subsequences, including the empty, which is the first element. Then the rest are generated in the order of including elements.\n\nAfter this, the result is the list with all possible subsequences, regardless of order.\n\nBut when you call result.sort(), it sorts the list in lex order.\n\nBut in Python, comparing lists is done lexicographically, so that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting this code.\n\nTest case 1: sequence = [1,2,3]\n\nResult before sorting is as before.\n\nAfter sorting, it's the same, so the output is as per the sample.\n\nTest case 2: sequence = [3,1,2]\n\nThe result after backtracking is:\n\n[[], [3], [3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2], [1], [1,2], [2], [1,2]\n\nWait, not sure. But regardless, after sorting the result should be in lex order.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nWait, but when I run this code, is it correct?\n\nYes.\n\nAnother point: each subsequence is printed on a new line, including the empty.\n\nBut in Python, when you print an empty list, it's '[]', which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nWait, but for the empty subsequence, is it correctly generated? Yes, because the initial call appends the empty path before going into the loop.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nImplement the function with the backtrack function, collect all subsequences, sort them, then print.\n\nYes.\n\nI'll now provide the Python code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence of integers using a backtracking algorithm. The generated subsequences should be printed in lexicographical order.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible subsequences of the given sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: We recursively build each subsequence by deciding whether to include each element of the sequence or not. This is done using a helper function that keeps track of the current subsequence being built and the starting index to ensure elements are considered in their original order.\n\n2. **Collecting Subsequences**: During the backtracking process, we collect all generated subsequences into a list. This includes the empty subsequence, which is the first to be added.\n\n3. **Sorting Subsequences**: After collecting all subsequences, we sort them lexicographically to ensure they are printed in the correct order.\n\n4. **Printing Subsequences**: Finally, we print each subsequence on a new line.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints all possible subsequences of the given sequence using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \n    :param sequence: A list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(start, current_path):\n        # Add the current path to the result list\n        result.append(current_path.copy())\n        # Iterate through each possible starting index\n        for i in range(start, len(sequence)):\n            # Include the current element in the path\n            current_path.append(sequence[i])\n            # Recur for the next index\n            backtrack(i + 1, current_path)\n            # Backtrack: remove the current element from the path\n            current_path.pop()\n    \n    # Start the backtracking process with an empty path and index 0\n    backtrack(0, [])\n    # Sort the result lexicographically\n    result.sort()\n    # Print each subsequence\n    for subseq in result:\n        print(subseq)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is defined to take the current starting index and the current subsequence being built. It adds the current subsequence to the result list and then recursively explores including each subsequent element in the sequence.\n\n2. **Recursive Exploration**: For each element starting from the current index, the element is added to the current subsequence, the function is called recursively to explore further elements, and then the element is removed to backtrack and consider the next element.\n\n3. **Sorting and Printing**: After collecting all possible subsequences, the list is sorted lexicographically. Each subsequence is then printed on a new line.\n\nThis approach ensures that all subsequences are generated and printed in the required order efficiently, even for the maximum constraint of sequence length 10.",
