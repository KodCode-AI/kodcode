  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence and print them in lexicographical order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a subsequence? Oh right, a subsequence can be any sequence that can be derived by deleting some elements without changing the order. So for [1,2,3], the subsequences include the empty list, all single elements, all pairs where the order is preserved, and the full sequence itself.\n\nWait, but the example shows that the output includes the empty list and all possible combinations. So I need to cover all cases.\n\nThe task mentions to use a backtracking algorithm. That rings a bell. Backtracking is a method where you try to build solutions by exploring all possibilities through recursion, making a choice at each step and then backtracking when a dead end is reached.\n\nSo how can I apply backtracking here? Let's think about building each subsequence step by step. For each element in the sequence, we can decide whether to include it in the current subsequence or not.\n\nWait, actually, in the case of subsequences, each step can be a binary choice: include this element or not. But wait, it's a little more involved than that. Because for a sequence like [1,2,3], when generating all subsequences, for each position, the choice is \"take it or leave it\", but ensuring that the order is preserved.\n\nSo for the backtracking approach, I can think recursively. Maybe we'll iterate through the array, and for each element, we have two options: include it in the current subsequence or not. Then, for each choice, we make a recursive call, passing along the current state of the subsequence.\n\nLet's structure this. I can have a helper function that builds the current subsequence as we go along. The parameters would be the start index, and the current subsequence.\n\nWait, but wait. How do I prevent duplicates? Well, if the input has unique elements, which it will according to the problem constraints, as it's a list of integers, but wait the sample has [1,2,3], which has unique elements. So, I think in this problem, the input can have duplicates, but for the lexicographical order, I have to make sure the output is sorted.\n\nWait but in the sample, the output is in the order that the function is able to generate them in lex order. So perhaps, the way to do it is to generate all possible subsequences, collect them, sort them, and then print. But wait, that could work but is that efficient for sequences with 10 elements? Because 2^10 is 1024, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the backtracking can be designed in a way that the sequences are generated in lex order, but that might complicate the approach.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think. Suppose the input sequence is [1,2,3], the desired output is a list of all possible subsequences, ordered lex. Wait, in the example, the first is empty, then [1], then [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], then [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nWait, in lex order, is that the case? Let me think about the lex order for these lists. How are they compared?\n\nComparing the lists lexicographically: [1] is less than [2], [1,2] is less than [1,3], so the sample's output looks correct.\n\nBut when generating all possible subsequences, how can we arrange them in lex order efficiently.\n\nOption 1: Generate all possible subsequences, collect them in a list, sort them, then print. This approach is straightforward. But to generate the subsequences correctly.\n\nBut for this, I can generate each possible subsequence, add them to a list, then sort the list.\n\nBut generating the subsequences can be done via bitmasking. For example, for a sequence of length n, each number from 0 to 2^n-1 can represent a subset, where each bit represents whether the corresponding element is included.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, it's required to use a backtracking approach, so I should implement it with backtracking. So, perhaps instead of using bitmasking, I need to simulate it with a recursive approach.\n\nSo, how to structure the recursion. Let's consider a helper function that starts with a current list and an index. For each element beyond that index, we can choose to include or exclude it.\n\nWait no, that's not entirely correct because the subtree may have multiple levels to explore.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way: for each index in the array, decide whether to include it in the current subset. Once included, we move to the next index. But since subsequences can be of varying lengths, including all possibilities, this should cover all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, how to implement this recursively.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. We'll start with an empty list and index 0.\n2. At each step, for the current index, we can branch into two possibilities: include the current element or exclude it.\n3. For including, we add the element to the current list and proceed to the next index. Alternatively, for excluding, we proceed without adding anything.\n4. When we reach the end of the sequence, the current list is a complete subsequence and is added to the collection.\n\nWait, no. That's for generating all subsets, not all subsequences. But wait, for a sequence like [1,2,3], the subsets (considering order is part of the subset) are accessed through the index. So perhaps, the same approach can work, but as each step moves forward, ensuring that the order is preserved.\n\nYes, because in each step, you decide to include the current element, then proceed to the next. So the subsequence is built in order.\n\nWait, let's think for the base case of an empty sequence\u2014then the only subsequence is the empty list. But the input is non-empty.\n\nBut sample has the empty list as the first output.\n\nSo the initial call would be to the helper function, which generates all possible by making the include/exclude choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the helper function can be designed as follows:\n\ndef backtrack(start, current_subsequence):\n\nWhere the helper function starts at a given start index, and for each element from start to end, decides to include or exclude.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, we can have a loop that for each possible element in the remaining sequence, include it and proceed. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, this is similar to the subset problem but for sequences preserving order.\n\nBut wait, I think the approach is to think that for each element, once you decide to include it, you can't go back and add earlier elements, since you have to maintain the order.\n\nWait, wait, because the subsequence must preserve the original order. So starting from index 0, for each step, you can choose to include it and then include any of the following, but you can't go back.\n\nSo perhaps a way to model this is recursively.\n\nHere's a possible structure:\n\n- The helper function takes the current index to consider and the current_subsequence built so far.\n\nFor each index from the current index in the array:\n\nInclude the current element and add it to current_subsequence.\n\nProceed to the next index (i+1) recursively, adding the next elements.\n\nThen, remove the current element from current_subsequence (backtracking) and proceed without including it.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Because if we include it, we can only proceed to pick elements after it. So perhaps, the next step is to call the function for index+1 and include it, but that's not the correct approach for the subset case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing subsets and subsequences. Let me clarify.\n\nFor a subset, the order does not matter. But in this problem, the subsequences are based on the original order. So the way backtracking works for generating subsets can be suitable because subsets, as in the power set, consider each element once, regardless of order. But we can model this as in the subset case because in this problem, each element can be included or not, but their order in the subsequence is the same as in the original sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the same approach as generating all subsets applies.\n\nThus, the helper function can be designed with a start index, representing that we have considered elements up to index start, and we can explore including or excluding elements starting from that point.\n\nWait, another approach: For each position, decide whether to include the element or not, and for each decision, pass on the current state to the next step.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ncurrent position: 0\n\ninclude 1, then current subsequence is [1], move to 1.\n\nAt position 1:\n\ninclude 2: [1,2], move to 2.\n\nAt position 2:\n\ninclude 3: [1,2,3], move to 3 which is beyond the array: so add [1,2,3] to the list.\n\nThen backtrack, exclude 3 to get [1,2], then include 3 again isn't an option, but no.\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps the base case is when the start index is equal to the length of the sequence. At that point, we add the current_subsequence to the result.\n\nSo the helper function could be defined as:\n\ndef helper(start, current_subseq):\n\n    if start == len(sequence):\n        result.append(current_subseq)\n        return\n\n    # include the element at start\n    helper(start + 1, current_subseq + [sequence[start]])\n\n    # exclude the element\n    helper(start + 1, current_subseq)\n\nBut wait, in this case, for each starting position, we choose whether to include the next element in the sequence.\n\nSo for the [1,2,3] case, the backtracking would generate the empty list, then each possible combination.\n\nBut when the print statements are called, the function as it is would first process the leftmost branch, thus adding all the lists in a depth-first manner. But the result is a list that contains all subsets, but in the order of the backtracking.\n\nWait, but the result may not be in lex order. So for the sample, using this, the order in which the sequences are generated is [1,2,3], [1,2], [1,3], [1], and so on.\n\nWait, no. Let's think step by step.\n\nIn the helper function, when start is 0:\n\nit includes 1 and calls helper(1, [1])\n\nAt start=1, it includes 2, calls helper(2, [1,2]).\n\nAt start=2, include 3, call helper(3, [1,2,3]). Since 3 is the length, add [1,2,3].\n\nThen, backtrack. Exclude 3 at start=2, so helper(2, [1,2] includes and excludes 3. Wait no: At start=2, the first call is to include 3, which adds [1,2,3], then the helper returns. Then, the exclude path is taken, which is helper(2+1=3, [1,2]), thus adding [1,2].\n\nWait, no. Let me see.\n\nThe initial process would go as follows:\n\n- helper(0, [])\n\nInside this function, it's going to call helper(1, [1]) (include 1), and then helper(1, [] ) (exclude 1).\n\nSo the include 1 path is taken first.\n\nWithin helper(1, [1]):\n\nIt includes 2, calls helper(2, [1,2]). \n\nWithin helper(2, [1,2]):\n\nIncludes 3, calls helper(3, [1,2,3]), which adds this to result.\n\nThen returns from that call, and excludes 3: helper(3, [1,2]) is called, adding [1,2].\n\nWait, no. Because when excluding 3, it's still helper(3, [1,2]). Which is beyond the array, so [1,2] is added.\n\nThen back to helper(2, [1,2]), which returns, so we go back to helper(1, [1]).\n\nThen, in helper(1, [1]), after processing include 2 (which branches into including or excluding 3), it will process the exclude 2 branch, which is helper(2, [1]).\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the helper function first includes the current element and calls itself, then excludes and calls again. Let me see.\n\nIn the function:\n\ndef helper(start, current_subseq):\n    if start == ...: add to result\n    else:\n        include the current element (start) and call start+1\n        exclude it, call start +1 with current_subseq\n\nWait, perhaps I should outline the order of recursive calls when the sequence is [1, 2, 3].\n\nLet me try mentally:\n\nThe initial call is helper(0, []).\n\nAt start=0, it includes 1 and makes a recursive call to helper(1, [1]).\n\nIn helper(1, [1]), the function will include 2 and call helper(2, [1,2]).\n\nIn helper(2, [1,2]), includes 3 and calls helper(3, [1,2,3]).\n\nThis adds [1,2,3] to the result.\n\nThen, helper(3) returns to helper(2), which then takes the exclude path: calls helper(3, [1,2]), because current_subseq is [1,2]. So this adds [1,2] to the result.\n\nThen, helper(2) returns to helper(1), which in its exclude path calls helper(2, [1]) (excluding 2, but since 2 is at index 1, that's confusing).\n\nWait maybe I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternative approach: visualize the recursion.\n\nAnother way to think: each call to helper represents the step where all elements before 'start' have been considered.\n\nEach call considers element start. Includes it and proceeds to start+1. Then, excludes it and proceeds as well.\n\nSo for each element at position 'start', the function may choose to include or exclude, leading to all possible combinations.\n\nThe problem is that the order in which the subsequences are generated (and hence stored in 'result') is depth first, which for the sample will result in the following order:\n\n1. [ ] (excluded all elements)\nWait no, because in the initial call, the first path is include 1, then others.\n\nWait, no. Wait wait, when the function is called, within each helper call, it first includes the current start, then excludes. So for the empty case, that is only generated if none of the elements are included.\n\nSo, for [1,2,3], the recursion will generate all the possible subsequences, but the order may be different than the sample expects. For the sample, the output is ordered in lex order.\n\nWait, the sample expects the empty list as the first output, then [1], followed by [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [ 2], [2,3], and [3].\n\nBut using this helper function, would the order in which the subsequences are generated be in lex order?\n\nIn the way the helper function is structured, the include path is taken first. So for [1,2,3], the first generated subsequences are [1,2,3], [1,2,], [1,3], [1], and so on.\n\nWhich would not match the sample's output.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because the sample expects the lex order, which is as if the lists were generated in a certain way.\n\nBut perhaps, using this helper function, the generated subsequences are in a different order than desired. So the approach would be: collect all subsequences via backtracking, then sort them, then print.\n\nThat might complicate the process, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Use the backtracking approach as described, collecting all subsequences into a list.\n\n2. Once all are collected, sort the list of subsequences in lex order.\n\n3. Print each in order, each on a separate line.\n\nBut before I proceed to code, I need to think about how to compare the subsequences in Python, if they are in a list. Subsequences are lists themselves, so they can be compared lexicographically using Python's default list comparison.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n- Initialize a result list to collect all subsequences.\n\n- Write a helper function that uses backtracking to generate all possible subsequences.\n\n- Once all subsequences are collected, sort them.\n\n- Print each subsequence in the sorted list.\n\nBut according to the sample, the empty list is the first, then [1], then [1,2], etc.\n\nWait, lex order of lists is determined by the elements. For example, the empty list is considered less than any non-empty list. Then comes [1], which is the first non-empty.\n\nLet's see what the sorted function would do.\n\nIn Python, the comparison is done element-wise. So, when we have [1] vs. [2], [1] is smaller. Similarly, [1,2] is smaller than [1,3], as both [1] are same, then 2 is smaller than 3.\n\nSo, the sorting function will do the right thing.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nresult = []\n\nhelper function appends each subsequence (a list) to result.\n\nAfter backtracking, sort the result using the default sort order.\n\nThen, print each subsequence in the sorted result.\n\nBut the helper function's code would be as the following:\n\nBut wait, how is the initial step handled?\n\nFor example, the empty list is generated when all elements are excluded.\n\nIn the helper function, how? Because initial list is empty, and when for each element, the exclude path is taken.\n\nSo, for the [1,2,3] case, the helper would be called in this way:\n\n- Initially, helper(0, []).\n\nAt start=0, current_subseq is [].\n\nInclude 1, call helper(1, [1]). This will explore all options starting with 1.\n\nExclude 1, call helper(1, []). This will explore options without 1.\n\nSo, in the exclude 1 path, the function will process options of including or excluding 2.\n\nLike, generate [] , [2], [2,3], [3], etc.\n\nThus, the empty list is generated when all elements are excluded. Which would be, in the helper function as the last step, after trying all possibilities.\n\nBut in the 'result', the empty list is included.\n\nWait, but in the helper function as designed earlier, the base case is when start == len(sequence). So at that point, it appends the current_subseq to result.\n\nSo, regardless of whether any elements are included, all possible paths are processed. Thus, the empty list is generated.\n\nHowever, when the include and exclude options are considered, and when the include path is taken first, the way the helper function is building the list, the empty list is added last.\n\nFor [1,2,3]:\n\nAfter all include and exclude steps, the empty list is the last in the 'result' list.\n\nWait, let's see: For the helper function.\n\nThe initial call is helper(0, []).\n\nCalls include 1, then helper(1, [1]) which adds other options.\n\nThen, back to helper(0, []), which proceeds to exclude 1 and call helper(1, []).\n\nOnce helper(1, []) is called, what happens? It will have include 2 (call helper(2, [2])), then include 3 in that path, and also exclude 3 to get [2]. Also, it will call exclude 2, to get to helper(2, []), in which include 3 and add [3], and in exclude path, call helper(3, []) which adds the empty list.\n\nSo, the helper function, when len(sequence)=3, the path that ends up in the empty list is processed as the last step.\n\nThus, in the collect phase, the empty list will be the last element in the result list.\n\nBut when we then sort the list of subsequences, the empty list comes first, then comes [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], etc.\n\nWhich will match the sample.\n\nSo, the approach is workable.\n\nThus, the plan is as follows:\n\n- Initialize the result list.\n\n- Implement the helper function that collects all possible subsequences.\n\n- After collection, sort the result lex order.\n\n- Print each subsequence, converting it to the string representation as in the sample.\n\nBut wait, how are the subsequences printed? The sample shows the lists, including the square brackets and commas.\n\nSo for a subsequence [1], the string printed is \"[1]\".\n\nThus, in Python, for each in the sorted list of subsequences, we can use str(subseq), but to handle the empty list as \"[]\", which is the default.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the output is as follows:\n\nIn the sample, the empty list is \"[]\" as the first line.\n\nThen \"[1]\" is printed as line two, etc.\n\nThus, the code, after generating and sorting all the subsequences, should loop through each and print their string representation.\n\nThus, the Python code would have after the backtracking:\n\nfor subseq in sorted(result):\n    print(subseq)\n\nBut wait, let's think about whether the sorted function will correctly sort the lists as per lex order.\n\nIn Python, yes. For example, the comparison of lists is done lex order.\n\nTesting this quickly in mind:\n\nShort test: the list [3] is considered after [1, 2, 3], which is [1,2,3] > [3] is false? Wait, compare first elements: [1, 2, 3] starts with 1, [3] starts with 3. Since 1 < 3, [1, ..., any] comes before [3, ...].\n\nThus, [1] comes before [2], which comes before [3], which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample, [1,3] comes before [2], because [1,3] is lex order in the first element. Wait, no in the sample, [1,3] comes after [1,2,3], [1,2] also, but before [2].\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. For example, [1,3] comes after [1,2,3], but [1,3] is [1,3], which is after [1,2] but before [1, any next elements].\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the sample as having the list:\n\nempty\nthen all lists starting with 1, in order of their contents.\n\nThen lists starting with 2: [2], [2,3].\n\nThen lists starting with 3: [3].\n\nSo, lex order for the whole list is that shorter lists come before longer ones when prefixes are same.\n\nSo [1] comes before [1,2], which comes before [1,2,3], etc.\n\nBut for comparing two lists, [1,3] comes in order: it's possible that [1,3] is compared as follows: the second element is 3 which is higher than 2, so [1,3] comes after [1,2] and [1,2,3], but before [1,4] if such existed.\n\nBut in the sample, [1,3] is indeed printed after [1,2,3] comes, but before [2]. Because when comparing [1,3] and [2], the first element is 1 vs. 2, so [1,3] comes before [2].\n\nWait, but [1,3] is longer than [2], but [1] is first, so [1,3] is considered as [1, ...] which comes before [2, ...].\n\nWait, in the sample, the output is:\n\nAfter [1,2,3], comes [1,3], then [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nLet me arrange the order lex order.\n\nThe first elements: [1], [2], [3], etc.\n\nFor the lists starting with 1:\n\nThe possible lists are: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3].\n\nThese are ordered as [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3].\n\nBecause [1,2] comes before [1,2,3], which comes before [1,3].\n\nSo in the sample, after empty list, [1] is first, then [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], then comes [2], [2,3], [3].\n\nIn the helper function, the lists are generated in a different order.\n\nThus, the code's helper function will collect all, including the empty list as generated in the last step. Then, the 'result' list is sorted using Python's list comparison, which will arrange them in lex order.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nSo now, to implement the code.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Import necessary modules: from typing import List.\n\n2. The function is to be named 'generate_all_subsequences', takes a sequence and returns None.\n\n3. Create a result list inside the function.\n\n4. Define a nested helper function that performs the backtracking.\n\n5. Call the helper function with start=0 and current_subseq=[].\n\n6. After collecting all, sort the 'result' list.\n\n7. Then, for each subseq in the sorted list, print them as per the string format.\n\nWait, but when we have the empty list, the string representation is '[]'.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(start, current):\n        if start == len(sequence):\n            result.append(current.copy())\n            return\n        # Include current element\n        current.append(sequence[start])\n        backtrack(start + 1, current)\n        # Exclude current element\n        current.pop()\n        backtrack(start + 1, current)\n    \n    backtrack(0, [])\n    # Now, sort the result\n    result.sort()\n    # Print each subsequence\n    for subseq in result:\n        print(subseq)\n\nWait, but wait: in the helper function above, when current is passed as a parameter, appending and popping could cause issues because of mutability.\n\nIn Python, the lists are mutable, so when you pass current to the next function, changes are made in place. Thus, the approach is to append the current element, proceed, then remove it (backtrack).\n\nYes, that is correct in the helper function.\n\nTesting this on the sample input [1,2,3], the result should collect:\n\nAfter backtracking, the 'result' list contains all possible subsequences, including empty. Let me see.\n\nBut when the helper is called as back(0, []), and for each step, it appends, calls, and pops.\n\nWait, after adding to result in base case, the current is the complete subsequence, which is copied to result.\n\nSo, current.copy() is necessary to prevent reference issues.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample:\n\nAfter backtracking, the result is as follows in 'result' before sorting:\n\nIn the helper function, when it starts, includes 1, 2, 3: [1,2,3] is added.\n\nThen, on backtracking, [1,2] is added.\n\nThen, when 3 is excluded from [1,2], call to start becomes 3, add the current [1,2].\n\nWait, perhaps not. It's a recursive function that may have various paths, but after all backtracking, 'result' will contain all possible 8 subsequences, including empty.\n\nThen, when sorted lexicographically, they are ordered as:\n\n[], [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,3], [2], [2,3], [3]\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the helper function, after popping (exclude), we call backtrack again. So the function is comprehensive.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nLet me take [a], but int\u2014so sequence [1], the result after backtracking will be [], [1], which when sorted gives [], [1], which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, to code it.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the helper function and the way current is passed.\n\nWait, in the helper function, initial current is [].\n\nAfter including and excluding, the function appends and pops from the same list. Thus, it's crucial that current.copy() is used when adding to 'result' because else, adding current would add a reference which can change afterwards.\n\nIn the code above, current.copy() is used, which is correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the code is as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to generate all possible subsequences of a given sequence of integers using a backtracking algorithm. The subsequences should be printed in lexicographical order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: We use a helper function that recursively builds each subsequence by deciding to include or exclude each element of the sequence at each step.\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: After generating all subsequences, we sort them to ensure they are in lexicographical order before printing.\n3. **Recursive Helper Function**: The helper function takes two parameters: the current index in the sequence and the current subsequence being built. It explores both possibilities of including and excluding the current element and recursively processes the next elements.\n4. **Collecting Results**: All generated subsequences are collected in a list, which is then sorted and printed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints all possible subsequences of the given sequence using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \n    :param sequence: A list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(start, current):\n        if start == len(sequence):\n            result.append(current.copy())\n            return\n        # Include the current element\n        current.append(sequence[start])\n        backtrack(start + 1, current)\n        # Exclude the current element\n        current.pop()\n        backtrack(start + 1, current)\n    \n    backtrack(0, [])\n    # Sort the result in lexicographical order\n    result.sort()\n    # Print each subsequence\n    for subseq in result:\n        print(subseq)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `result` to collect all generated subsequences.\n2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is defined to recursively build subsequences. It starts at index 0 with an empty subsequence. For each element, it decides to include it, recursively call itself with the next index, and then backtrack by excluding the element.\n3. **Base Case**: When the current index equals the length of the sequence, the current subsequence is added to `result`.\n4. **Sorting and Printing**: After all subsequences are generated, `result` is sorted lexicographically. Each subsequence is then printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible subsequences are generated efficiently and printed in the correct order.",
