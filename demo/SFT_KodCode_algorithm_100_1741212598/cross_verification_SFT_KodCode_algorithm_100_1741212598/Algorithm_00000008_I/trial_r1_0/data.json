  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called detect_cycle that uses Floyd's algorithm to determine if a singly linked list has a cycle. Let me think about how Floyd's algorithm works.\n\nSo, Floyd's cycle detection algorithm is also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. The idea is to have two pointers that move through the list at different speeds. If there's a cycle, these pointers will eventually meet.\n\nWait, right. So the algorithm uses two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at each step. If there's a cycle, the fast will catch up to the slow. If there's no cycle, the fast will reach the end.\n\nSo, for this function, I need to implement that logic. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to handle edge cases. What if the linked list is empty? Well, in that case, there's no cycle, so return False. Also, if the list has only one node, there's no cycle possible, so again return False.\n\nRight, so in the code, I should first check if the linked_list is None or its head is None. Or wait, how is the linked_list object structured? I should check whether the linked_list exists and if it's non-empty.\n\nWait, the linked_list is passed as a parameter. So first, I might check if the head is None. Because if the list is empty, linked_list.head would be None, right? Or if the list has zero nodes.\n\nWait, looking at the example, in the first case, a cycle is created when linked_list has at least two nodes. So in our function, first, if the linked_list is empty (head is None), return False.\n\nAlso, if the head's next is None (only one node), also return False.\n\nOtherwise, we can proceed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the linked list is empty or has only one node. If yes, return False.\n\nOtherwise, initialize two pointers, slow and fast.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: sometimes even a list with two nodes can have a cycle. Like if node 1 points to node 2, and node 2 points back to node1. So the length isn't the issue; whether a cycle exists is.\n\nBut for the initial step, let's first check if the linked list has 0 or 1 node \u2014 no possible cycle except in the case where the only node points to itself. Hmm, wait, that's a possible edge case. So I need to handle that.\n\nWait, for a single node linked list, it's possible for the next pointer to point to itself, creating a cycle of length 1. So in that case, detect_cycle should return True.\n\nWait, let's see. How can a single node have a cycle? It can. Like, the node's next is itself.\n\nSo, checking linked_list.head is not None, but if it's a single node, we need to see if head.next is not None.\n\nWait, for a single node, if it's linked to itself, the function should return True. So, the initial approach can't just return False if the list has one node.\n\nSo, perhaps, I need to handle that case before checking for it.\n\nSo, first, I should check:\n\nIf the linked list is empty (head is None): return False.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, for the process:\n\nSet slow to head, and fast to head as well? Or wait, no, perhaps to handle null checks better.\n\nWait, I think I can't set fast to head, because if the head is None, but that's already checked.\n\nSo, assuming linked_list is not empty, then:\n\nSlow starts at head.\n\nFast starts at head as well.\n\nWait, I think the correct approach is:\n\nslow_ptr = head\n\nfast_ptr = head.next\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Because two pointers both start at head. Then, in each step, slow moves to next, fast moves two steps. But wait, what if the head is the last node. Like a single node linked list where next is None. Then, slow is head, fast would be None. So trying to move fast will cause an error.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nCheck if the head is None: return False.\n\nElse, set slow to head, fast to head.\n\nBut then, in each iteration, make sure that fast and fast.next are not None before proceeding.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: set slow = head, fast = head.\n\nThen, in a loop where we advance until fast or fast.next is None.\n\nOkay, perhaps let's consider the code structure.\n\nImplement:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n\n        return False\n\n    slow_ptr = linked_list.head\n\n    fast_ptr = linked_list.head\n\n    while True:\n\n        # Move slow_ptr by one step\n\n        slow_ptr = slow_ptr.next_node\n\n        # Move fast_ptr by two steps\n\n        # First check if fast_ptr is None, to avoid error when moving\n\n        if fast_ptr is None or fast_ptr.next_node is None:\n\n            break  # No cycle, fast reached end\n\n        fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next_node.next_node\n\n        # Now, check if slow and fast meet\n\n        if slow_ptr == fast_ptr:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but this may miss the case where the cycle is of length 1 in a single node.\n\nWait, let's consider:\n\nIf the linked list has only one node, and its next points to itself.\n\nThen:\n\nslow starts at head (node A).\n\nfast is also head (node A).\n\nNow, in the loop:\n\nMove slow to slow.next -> node A.next is node A, so slow is node A.\n\nThen check if fast is None or fast.next is None: fast is node A, so fast.next is node A, so not None.\n\nSo fast becomes fast.next.next, which is (A.next).next is A.next is A again. So fast = A.\n\nSo now, after moving, slow is A, fast is A.\n\nSo, slow_ptr == fast_ptr is True, return True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but in the code, the first step is slow is head, which is A; then in the loop, slow moves to A.next, which is A.\n\nThen, after that, fast is checked.\n\nWait, code steps:\n\nInitial:\n\nslow_ptr = A\n\nfast_ptr = A\n\nLoop:\n\nslow_ptr = A.next (A)\n\nCheck if fast (A) is None? No. fast.next is A, which is not None.\n\nSo fast becomes A.next.next, which is A.next is A, .next again is A.\n\nSo fast is A.\n\nNow, check if slow (A) == fast (A). Yes, return True.\n\nSo the code handles the single node case.\n\nBut wait, what if the linked list has one node with next=None? So no cycle.\n\nThen:\n\nIn the code, initial slow and fast are A.\n\nLoop:\n\nslow moves to A.next (None).\n\nThen, check fast:\n\nfast is A. fast.next is A.next is None.\n\nSo in the 'if' condition: fast is A (okay), but fast.next is None.\n\nSo the 'if' condition is True: break the loop.\n\nSo the loop exits, return False. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nTwo-node list with cycle: node1 points to node2, node2 points to node1.\n\nslow starts at node1, fast starts at node1.\n\nLoop starts:\n\nslow moves to node1.next (node2).\n\nfast: check if fast is None or fast.next is None? fast is node1, fast.next is node2 (not None), so proceed.\n\nfast becomes fast.next.next: node2.next is node1.\n\nSo fast is node1.\n\nNow, check if slow (node2) == fast (node1) \u2192 no.\n\nLoop again.\n\nMove slow to node2's next \u2192 node1.\n\nNow, check fast: current is node1. fast_ptr.next is node2.\n\nFast becomes node1.next.next \u2192 node2.next is node1.\n\nSo fast is node1 again.\n\nCheck: slow is node1. fast is node1. So equal \u2192 return True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: three-node list with cycle after 2 nodes.\n\nnode1 \u2192 node2 \u2192 node3 \u2192 node2...\n\nSo how does the algorithm work?\n\nSlow and fast start at node1.\n\nLoop first iteration:\n\nslow moves to node2.\n\nfast moves two steps: node1.next is node2, then node2.next is node3. So fast is node3.\n\nCheck if slow (node2) equals fast (node3): no.\n\nLoop continues.\n\nNext step: slow_ptr = node2.next \u2192 node3.\n\nfast_ptr: node3.next is node2, and then node2.next is node3. So fast becomes node3.\n\nCheck: slow is node3, fast is node3 \u2192 yes, return True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo seems like the code handles these cases.\n\nBut wait: I need to be cautious when the linked list is empty or has one node.\n\nIn code: the function first checks if linked_list.head is None, return False.\n\nThis is correct, including the empty list.\n\nLet me see how the code handles the one node case with a cycle and without.\n\nCase 1: one node with next as None.\n\nAfter the head check:\n\nslow and fast are both node.\n\nLoop:\n\nslow = node.next \u2192 None.\n\nCheck fast: fast is node, fast.next is None. So condition is triggered, loop breaks, returns False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nCase 2: one node with next pointing to itself.\n\nLoop:\n\nslow moves to node's next, which is node (cycle).\n\nThen, check if fast is null or fast's next is null.\n\nCurrently, fast is node. fast's next is node (so no null). So fast becomes fast's next's next, which is node.\n\nSo after moving, slow is node and fast is node, so equal \u2192 return True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWait, but let's what about when the list is longer and no cycle.\n\nFor example: 3 nodes pointing to None.\n\nSo:\n\nLoop: first moves slow to node2.\n\nFast becomes node3. Check if fast.next is None, yes, so break. Return False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the loop condition: the code is in a while True loop, which could potentially be an infinite loop if something goes wrong.\n\nSo, I should think about possible infinite loops.\n\nBut according to Floyd's algorithm, in the case where there is no cycle, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end of the list, at which point either fast or fast.next is null, so the loop breaks.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes. So in the code, after each iteration, fast_ptr is incremented by two steps, slowly.\n\nBut wait, is it possible that in a non-cyclic list, the algorithm runs and can't get out? For example, if the list is even length and something goes wrong.\n\nWait, no, because in each iteration, the loop continues only if fast_ptr and its next are not None.\n\nSo for the case where fast can't take two steps, the loop exits.\n\nThus, I think the code is correct.\n\nBut how to translate this into Python code? Because I have to implement it.\n\nSo, in Python, the linked_list has a head attribute. Each node has next_node.\n\nSo, let's structure the code:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n\n    if not linked_list.head:\n\n        return False\n\n    slow_ptr = linked_list.head\n\n    fast_ptr = linked_list.head\n\n    while True:\n\n        # Move slow_ptr forward by one\n\n        slow_ptr = slow_ptr.next_node\n\n        # Check if fast_ptr can move forward by two\n\n        if fast_ptr is None or fast_ptr.next_node is None:\n\n            break  # End of list, no cycle\n\n        fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next_node.next_node\n\n        # Check if slow and fast are same\n\n        if slow_ptr == fast_ptr:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, no, wait: in the code above, slow_ptr is moved first, then the fast_ptr is checked whether it can move two steps. If yes, it is moved. Then the cycle is checked.\n\nWait, let me step through this logic with a sample linked list.\n\nExample 1: one node pointing to itself.\n\nlinked_list with head is A.\n\nslow_ptr = A\n\nfast_ptr = A\n\nLoop starts.\n\nFirst, slow_ptr is set to A.next \u2192 A.\n\nThen, check fast_ptr: is it None? No. fast_ptr.next_node? A.next_node is A, not None. So no break.\n\nfast_ptr becomes A.next.next of fast_ptr (which is A): A -> A.next is A, then next is A.\n\nThen, it's check: slow is A? No. So, fast is A.\n\nSo, if slow and fast are equal, yes. So function returns True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: linked list has two nodes, A -> B, and B -> A.\n\nInitial:\n\nslow_ptr = A\n\nfast_ptr = A\n\nLoop starts:\n\nslow moves to B.\n\nfast can move: fast.next is B, which is not null. So fast moves to B's next, which is A (since B points back to A). So after that, fast is A.\n\nThen, check slow (B) == fast (A) \u2192 no.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nslow moves to B's next (which is A).\n\nCheck fast_ptr: is fast (A) or A's next (B) None? No. So fast moves to B's next (A's next is B, so fast becomes B's next: whichis A again?\n\nWait, wait:\n\nfast_ptr is initially A after first loop.\n\nThen, in second loop step:\n\nfast_ptr is A.\n\nA's next is B, which is not None. So allowed to move.\n\nSo, first step is:\n\nfast_ptr = fast_ptr.next_node \u2192 B.\n\nThen, fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next_node again \u2192 which is A.\n\nSo, after this movement, fast becomes A.\n\nNow, after movement, it's checking if slow (A) == fast (A) \u2192 yes. So return True.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother example: three nodes with cycle at the third node pointing to the second.\n\nEach node: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B.\n\nSo cycle between B and C.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial: slow=A, fast=A.\n\nFirst loop:\n\nSlow becomes B.\n\nFast: is A and A's next (B) is not None. So fast becomes A.next.next \u2192 B.\n\nSo fast is B.\n\nCheck if B == B? No, because slow is also B. Oh wait, slow is B and fast is B? So yes.\n\nSo function returns True immediately.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, initial: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 B.\n\nSo, the linked list is A -> B -> C -> B -> C -> ... ad infinitum.\n\nSo Floyd's algorithm catches the loop.\n\nWait, after first step: slow is B, fast is B \u2192 so returns True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the linked list is longer without cycle: A->B->C->D->None.\n\nThen, first loop:\n\nslow is B.\n\nfast is A \u2192 A's next is B (not null), so fast becomes B's next of B, which is C. So fast is C.\n\nCheck if B == C: no.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nslow is C.\n\nCheck fast: fast is C, C's next is D (not null). So move fast to D's next, which is None.\n\nSo, since in the code, after moving slow first, then check if fast can move.\n\nWait, no: in code, step is slow first, then after that, check if fast can move and if so, move it.\n\nWait, the code for the loop:\n\nslow moves first.\n\nThen, if fast is not None and fast's next is not None \u2192 proceed to move fast.\n\nSo, after two loops, let's see:\n\nFirst iteration: slow = B, fast=A \u2192 can move to C.\n\ncheck if B == C \u2192 no.\n\nThen, second iteration: slow = C, fast=C.\n\nCheck fast and fast.next: C is not None, C.next is D (not None), so move fast to D.next \u2192 which is None.\n\nWait, code:\n\nIn the first iteration, after slow is B, and fast becomes C.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow = B.next = C.\n\nThen, check for fast: currently at C.\n\nCheck if C or C.next is None? C.next is D, which is not None. So set fast = C.next.next \u2192 D.\n\nThen, check if slow (C) and fast (D) are equal \u2192 no.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nslow moves to C.next = D.\n\nCheck for fast_ptr: D and D.next is None. So, in the condition, since D is not None, but D.next is None \u2192 condition is true, break the loop.\n\nSo returns False, which is correct.\n\nSo, all seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered most cases. So the code seems to be correctly implementing Floyd's algorithm.\n\nNow, let's see how the function is supposed to be written.\n\nThe function is given, but we need to implement it.\n\nWait, what about if the linked_list is empty? First line handles that.\n\nSo, everything seems correct.\n\nSo, the code above is correct.\n\nTesting:\n\nIn the first example from the problem:\n\nAfter adding four nodes (1, 2, 3,4), then setting the third node's next to second (so after node 4, links to node 2? Or is it...\n\nWait, in the first example, node 3 is next of 2, which is next of 1, which is head.\n\nSo linked_list.add_node(1): head is 1.\n\nadd 2: 1's next is 2.\n\nadd 3: 2's next is 3.\n\nadd 4: 3's next is 4.\n\nThen, create a cycle by setting linked_list.head.next_node.next_node.next_node = linked_list.head.next_node.\n\nWhich is, the third node's next (4) is set to head.next_node (2). So the linked list is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 ->2 -> 3 -> 2 ... etc.\n\nSo, the code should detect the cycle.\n\nYes; the code using Floyd's algorithm will find the intersection.\n\nSo, I think the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nAnother thing, the function is supposed to handle up to 1e5 nodes. But since Floyd's algorithm is O(n), and we have no space usage (O(1)), it's efficient enough.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a singly linked list contains a cycle using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. This algorithm efficiently detects cycles in linear time with constant space complexity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to detect whether a cycle exists in a singly linked list. A cycle occurs if any node points back to a previous node, creating a loop.\n2. **Floyd's Algorithm**: This algorithm uses two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at each step. If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty linked list (head is None) cannot have a cycle.\n   - A linked list with only one node can have a cycle if the node points to itself.\n4. **Initialization**: Start both slow and fast pointers at the head of the linked list.\n5. **Cycle Detection**:\n   - Move the slow pointer one step at a time.\n   - Move the fast pointer two steps at a time, ensuring it does not encounter a None value, which indicates the end of the list.\n   - If the slow and fast pointers meet at any point, a cycle exists.\n6. **Termination**: If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, no cycle exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next_node = None\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n\n    def add_node(self, data):\n        new_node = Node(data)\n        if self.head is None:\n            self.head = new_node\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            while current.next_node:\n                current = current.next_node\n            current.next_node = new_node\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n        return False\n\n    slow_ptr = linked_list.head\n    fast_ptr = linked_list.head\n\n    while True:\n        # Move slow pointer one step\n        slow_ptr = slow_ptr.next_node\n\n        if fast_ptr is None or fast_ptr.next_node is None:\n            break  # Reached end, no cycle\n\n        # Move fast pointer two steps\n        fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next_node.next_node\n\n        if slow_ptr == fast_ptr:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the linked list is empty. If it is, it returns False immediately.\n- **Slow and Fast Pointers**: Both pointers start at the head of the list. In each iteration, the slow pointer moves one step, while the fast pointer moves two steps.\n- **Cycle Check**: If at any point the slow and fast pointers meet, it indicates a cycle, and the function returns True.\n- **Termination**: If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the function breaks out of the loop and returns False, indicating no cycle exists.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently detect cycles in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity, making it suitable for large lists with up to 100,000 nodes.",
