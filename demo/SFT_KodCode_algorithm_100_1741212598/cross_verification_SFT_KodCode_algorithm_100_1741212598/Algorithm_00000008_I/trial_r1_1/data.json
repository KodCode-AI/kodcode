  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement the detect_cycle function for a singly linked list using Floyd's algorithm. Let's see, Floyd's algorithm is also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. I remember that it's an efficient way to detect cycles without using extra space.\n\nHmm, the linked_list is a LinkedList instance. So I need to get the head node of the linked list first. Wait, but in Python, how is this LinkedList structured? The function expects that we can traverse the list via next_node pointers.\n\nSo the plan is: use two pointers, slow and fast. The slow moves one step each time, the fast moves two steps each time. If there's a cycle, these two pointers will eventually meet. If they meet, return True; otherwise, if we reach the end, return False.\n\nWait, let me think about the steps.\n\nInitialize slow and fast to the head. Then, while fast is not None and fast.next is not None. Because for fast to move, it needs a next node so that fast.next.next is valid.\n\nWait wait, maybe in each iteration, I should first move slow by one, then fast by two. Or move both in each step. Let's get the loop condition right.\n\nSo the loop runs as long as fast is not None and fast.next is not None. Because in each step, fast is moving two steps. So checking that fast and fast.next exists before moving.\n\nInside the loop:\n- move slow once: slow = slow.next_node\n- move fast twice: fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n\nIf at any point slow and fast meet (slow == fast), then there's a cycle. Return True.\n\nBut wait, the initial condition: what if the head is None (empty list)? The function should return False in that case.\n\nOh right, we need to handle edge cases.\n\nAlso, for a single node: if the node's next is None, no cycle. If the node points to itself, then it's a cycle.\n\nSo the first step is to handle edge cases: if the linked list is empty (head is None), return False. Else, proceed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the linked list is empty. If yes, return False.\n2. Initialize slow and fast pointers to head.\n3. While fast is not null and fast.next is not null:\n   a. Move slow one step.\n   b. Move fast two steps.\n   c. If slow equals fast, return True.\n4. If the loop exits without meeting, return False.\n\nWait, why do I have to check fast and fast.next in the loop condition? Because when fast is at the last node, its next is null. So trying to get fast.next.next would cause an error.\n\nFor example, if the list is 1,2,3,4 with next pointing as 1\u21922\u21923\u21924. Fast starts at 1, then first iteration, fast is 3 (steps are 1\u21922, then 2\u21923), wait no:\n\nWait initial:\n\nslow = 1, fast =1.\n\nLoop:\nslow moves to 2.\nfast moves to 1.next (2), then 2.next (3). So fast is now 3.\n\nCheck if slow (2) == fast (3)? No.\n\nNext iteration:\nslow moves to 3.\nfast moves to 3.next (4), then 4.next (null), so fast is null. But in the loop condition, we have to check if fast is not null and fast.next is not null. So after this step, the next iteration will not run.\n\nSo, in this case, the loop wouldn't find a cycle, and the function returns False.\n\nBut if there's a cycle, at some point, slow and fast will point to the same node. For example, in the sample case where node4 points back to node2.\n\nSo, node1 \u2192 node2 \u2192 node3 \u2192 node4 \u2192 node2 \u2192 ... and so on.\n\nLet me simulate this:\n\nHead is node1.\n\nslow = node1, fast = node1.\n\nLoop:\n\nslow = node1.next \u2192 node2.\n\nfast = node1.next = node2, then node2.next = node3. So fast is node3.\n\nnode2 != node3.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nslow = node3.\n\nfast: current is node3. move to node4, then node4's next is node2. so fast is node2.\n\nSo slow is node3, fast is node2.\n\nNot equal.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nslow = node2.\n\nfast = node2's next (node3), then node3's next (node4). So fast is node4.\n\nnode2 != node4.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nslow moves to node3.\n\nWait, no: wait, after some time, maybe it'll loop. Because in the list with a cycle, the two will eventually meet.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nLet me take the sample case:\n\nAfter adding nodes 1-4, and the cycle: node4 \u2192 node2.\n\nSo the head is 1, next is 2, then 3, then 4. 4.next is 2.\n\nSo the list is 1\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21922...\n\nInitial pointers:\n\nslow = head (1)\n\nfast = head (1)\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast moves to 2's next (3), and then 3's next is 4. So fast is now at 4.\n\nCheck: 2 vs 4. Not same.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow moves to 3.\n\nfast is at 4; moves to 4's next (2), then 2's next (3). So fast is at 3.\n\nCheck: slow (3) equals fast (3). So return True.\n\nSo that's how it's detected.\n\nSo that case works.\n\nNow, what about if the cycle is the node itself? Like node pointing to itself. For a single-node linked list where node.next is itself.\n\nIn that case, the loop starts:\n\nslow and fast are at the same node. So the initial check would trigger a return True.\n\nWait, wait: let's see. Suppose the linked list has one node, whose next is itself.\n\nHead is some node A, A.next is A.\n\nIn the first iteration:\n\nslow = A.next (A)\n\nfast: move two steps. So starting at A.\n\nA.next is A, then A's next is A again. So fast = A.\n\nSo slow is A, fast is A. They are equal. So return True.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about when the list is empty? If the linked list is empty, return False.\n\nWhat if the list has two nodes, with the second pointing back to the first.\n\nLike 1\u21922, 2\u21921.\n\nIn the first iteration:\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast moves to 2, then 1. So at fast node 1.\n\nNot equal.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow moves to 1.\n\nfast is at 1, moves to 2, then 1 again. Now, fast is 1.\n\nSo slow is 1 (from the previous step in slow) equals fast (1). So return True.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nWe can get the head from the linked list, right?\n\nSo first, in Python, for the linked list, we need to get the head. But I'm assuming that 'linked_list' has an attribute called 'head' which is the starting node.\n\nYes, looking at the sample input linked list: linked_list.add_node multiple times. And the cycle is set as linked_list.head.next_node.next_node.next_node = linked_list.head.next_node.\n\nSo linked_list has a head attribute.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n    if linked_list is None:\n        return False\n    slow = linked_list.head\n    fast = linked_list.head\n    while fast is not None and fast.next_node is not None:\n        slow = slow.next_node\n        fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait. We have to make sure that when moving slow and fast, we don't access None's next_node. But since the loop condition is that fast is not None and fast.next is not None, then when inside the loop, fast.next exists. So when fast is updated to fast.next_node.next_node, in that step, why would that be a problem?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the list is A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D, and fast is at C when the loop runs.\n\nThen, in this case, fast.next is D, then fast becomes D's next. Suppose D is the last node, and D's next is None. Then, fast.next_node is None; but wait, the loop condition already fails because when fast is at D, fast's next is None, but in the condition of the while loop, it's checking whether fast is not None and fast.next is not None. So the loop will not run for that step. So inside the loop, when we assign fast = fast.next_node.next_node, it's safe because we already ensure that fast.next is not None.\n\nWait wait: Suppose inside the loop, after moving slow and fast, we check if they're same. But the condition for the loop is only on the initial state of fast. So for example, during the last step in a non-cyclic list, fast is at C, which has next D (so far). Then inside loop, we:\n\n- slow moves to B.next (C)\n\n- fast moves to C.next (D), then D.next is None. So fast becomes None.\n\nThen fast becomes None.\n\nBut then the loop will not run again because the next condition is while fast is not None. But the problem is that in the code, inside the loop, after moving, it could cause fast to be None. So when trying to move, but what about? Because when entering the loop, fast and fast.next are valid. So when doing fast = fast.next.next, is there a possibility of a None access?\n\nWait after the fast is updated, could it become None? Yes, but that's acceptable because the next iteration's condition will handle it.\n\nFor example, let's say:\n\nWe have a list A\u2192B\u2192None.\n\nFirst, the initial linked_list is linked_list2 in the example, which has only one node, 1.\n\nWait, no. In the example, linked_list2 has one node, head is 1. The function should return False because without a cycle.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn that case:\n\nslow starts as head (1).\n\nfast starts as head (1).\n\nThe loop condition is: fast is not None (true, head is 1) and fast.next is not None. But for the single node, 1.next is None.\n\nSo the loop condition is false. So the loop doesn't run, and the function returns False.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nWait, but if we have a linked_list of a single node pointing to itself, like 1\u21921. So when the head is 1:\n\nThen, loop condition is while fast != None and fast.next != None: initially, 1 is not None, and 1's next is 1, which is not None. So loop runs.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nslow moves to 1.next \u21921.\n\nfast moves to 1.next \u21921, then 1.next \u21921. So fast is 1.\n\nThen we check if slow == fast (both 1), so return True.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nWhat about if the linked list is empty? Well, the first if condition is not necessary because if linked_list is None? Or perhaps in Python, if linked_list is a LinkedList instance, it's not None even if empty.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first linked_list is created as LinkedList() and nodes are added. So the linked_list is never None; it's an instance, whose head could be None.\n\nSo maybe, instead of checking if linked_list is None, we should check if linked_list.head is None.\n\nSo the first step is:\n\nif linked_list.head is None:\n\n    return False\n\nElse:\n\nproceed.\n\nBecause trying to get slow and fast as linked_list.head will cause issues only if head is None.\n\nSo code steps:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n        return False\n    slow = linked_list.head\n    fast = linked_list.head\n    while fast.next_node is not None and fast is not None:\n        slow = slow.next_node\n        fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nWait wait, no: the loop condition should check that fast is not None and fast.next is not None. Because after moving, trying to access fast.next_node's next.\n\nWait wait, no: in each iteration of the loop, we move fast twice. So before each step, we need to make sure that fast and fast.next are not None before moving. Because when we have fast.next, we need to be able to get fast.next.next.\n\nSo the correct condition is while fast is not None and fast.next_node is not None.\n\nWait no: wait, the condition is to be able to move fast by two steps safely. So inside the loop, after moving, but the condition is checked before iteration.\n\nSo the condition should be while fast is not None and fast.next is not None.\n\nNo, no: the condition in the loop is whether it is safe to proceed for another iteration, i.e., whether fast can take two steps. So for that, fast and fast.next must not be None.\n\nWait, in the sample case where fast is at the second last node. Suppose we have 4 nodes, 1\u21922\u21923\u21924. And in normal (no cycle), linked list ends at 4. Then, we enter the loop:\n\nslow starts at 1.\n\nAfter first iteration, slow is 2, fast is 3.\n\nCheck if 2 ==3? No. Then, second iteration: slow is 3, fast is 4. 3 !=4. Now, in the next iteration, the loop condition is checked: whether fast is not None (fast is 4) and fast.next is not None (because 4's next is None?) Wait, in this example, the list doesn't have a cycle, so 4's next is None.\n\nSo during the while condition, since fast is 4, fast.next is None. So the condition fast.next_node is not None becomes False. So the loop stops.\n\nThen, after the loop, return False. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo to handle all cases, the code should be written as:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n    if linked_list is None or linked_list.head is None:\n        return False\n    slow = linked_list.head\n    fast = linked_list.head\n    while fast is not None and fast.next_node is not None:\n        slow = slow.next_node\n        fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n        # Check if slow and fast meet\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    # If we exit the loop, no cycle found\n    return False\n\nWait, wait: the condition on the while loop is 'fast is not None and fast.next is not None'. So when fast is not None but fast.next is None, the loop doesn't run.\n\nBut let's think: when fast is None, the loop won't run. Or when fast's next is None.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code with example 2: single node linked_list2, which has head pointing to a node with data 1.\n\nLoop condition: fast is 1 (head), fast.next is None. So condition is false. The function returns False.\n\nAnother test: linked list has two nodes pointing to each other.\n\nHead is A, next is B. B's next is A.\n\nLoop:\n\nslow begins at A.\n\nfast begins at A.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow = slow.next \u2192 B.\n\nfast = A.next is B, then B.next is A. So fast = A.\n\nSlow is B, fast is A: not same. Loop continues.\n\nIn next iteration:\n\nCheck condition: fast is A. A's next is B. So condition is true.\n\nInside:\n\nslow = B.next \u2192 A.\n\nfast = A.next \u2192 B, then B.next \u2192 A. So fast is A.\n\nNow, check if A == A \u2192 yes. Return True.\n\nYes, works.\n\nAnother test: a long linked list with a cycle somewhere. The code should detect it.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code should first handle the case when the list is empty, i.e., head is None \u2192 return False.\n\nElse, proceed with the Floyd's algorithm.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to detect whether a cycle exists in a singly linked list using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. This algorithm efficiently determines the presence of a cycle with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, these two pointers will eventually meet. If they meet, a cycle exists; otherwise, if the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, no cycle exists.\n\nHere are the steps in detail:\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the linked list is empty, return `False` immediately as there cannot be a cycle.\n2. **Initialize pointers**: Start both slow and fast pointers at the head of the linked list.\n3. **Traverse the list**: Use a loop to move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps at a time.\n4. **Cycle detection**: If the slow and fast pointers meet at any point, a cycle exists, and we return `True`.\n5. **Termination**: If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., becomes `None` or its next node becomes `None`), return `False` indicating no cycle.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass LinkedListNode:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next_node = None\n\nclass LinkedList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n\n    def add_node(self, data):\n        new_node = LinkedListNode(data)\n        if not self.head:\n            self.head = new_node\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            while current.next_node:\n                current = current.next_node\n            current.next_node = new_node\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n        return False\n    slow = linked_list.head\n    fast = linked_list.head\n    while fast is not None and fast.next_node is not None:\n        slow = slow.next_node\n        fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the linked list is empty. If it is, we return `False` immediately.\n- **Pointer Movement**: The slow pointer moves one node at a time (`slow = slow.next_node`), while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time (`fast = fast.next_node.next_node`).\n- **Cycle Check**: If at any point the slow and fast pointers meet, it indicates a cycle, and we return `True`.\n- **Termination**: If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, we conclude there is no cycle and return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently detect cycles with optimal time and space complexity, making it suitable for large linked lists up to \\(10^5\\) nodes.",
