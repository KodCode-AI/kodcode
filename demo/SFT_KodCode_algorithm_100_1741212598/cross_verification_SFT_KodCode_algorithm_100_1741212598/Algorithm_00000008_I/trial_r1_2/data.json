  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement a function called detect_cycle that takes a LinkedList as input and returns True if there's a cycle, False otherwise. I remember that Floyd's cycle detection algorithm is also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. So I should use that.\n\nHmm, how does Floyd's algorithm work? Oh right, there are two pointers: a slow one that moves one step at a time, and a fast one that moves two steps. If there's a cycle, the fast will eventually catch up to the slow. If they meet, there's a cycle; otherwise, if the fast reaches the end, there isn't.\n\nSo first, I need to handle edge cases. Like if the linked list is empty, there's definitely no cycle. Also, if there's only one node, and no next, then no cycle. But wait, if the node points to itself, that's a cycle.\n\nSo in the code, I'll first check if the linked list is empty. If head is None, return False. Then, I'll initialize two pointers: slow and fast. What about if the head's next is None? That's also no cycle.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see. The standard Floyd's algorithm for cycle detection starts with two pointers, slow at head, fast at head. Then:\n\nslow = slow.next\nfast = fast.next.next\n\nDoing this each step. So in each iteration, move slow once, fast twice.\n\nBut I have to make sure that I don't get any null pointer exceptions. So every time before accessing next_node, check if the current is not null and the next exists.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the linked list is empty (head is None). Return False.\n2. Initialize slow and fast to head.\n3. While fast is not None and fast.next is not None:\n   a. Move slow to slow.next.\n   b. Move fast to fast.next.next.\n   c. If at any point slow == fast, return True.\n4. If the loop ends without them meeting, return False.\n\nWait, but in the loop condition: fast and fast.next must not be None to prevent errors when moving. So the loop runs only when fast can move two steps.\n\nWait, actually, the condition is that during the iteration, when trying to advance, make sure that accessing next nodes is possible. So initializing fast as head, which is not None, but if the list has only one node, the loop condition is false. Because for the list with one node, fast is head, fast.next is None, so the condition (fast is not None and fast.next is not None) is false. So the loop doesn't run, function returns False, which is correct because a single node without pointing back isn't a cycle.\n\nWhat about if the list has two nodes, each pointing to each other? Let's see.\n\nTesting:\n\nlinked_list is two nodes: head is node1, node1.next is node2. node2.next is node1.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nslow starts at node1.\n\nfast starts at node1.\n\nFirst iteration:\nslow moves to node2.\nfast moves to node2.next, which is node1, then node1.next again? Wait no: the movement for fast is two steps. So fast = fast.next (node2), then fast = fast.next (node1). So after this, fast is node1.\n\nComparing slow (node2) and fast (node1) are not the same. So loop continues.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nAt the start of the loop, we check if fast is not None and fast.next is not None. Fast is node1, which has next node2, which is not None. So loop runs.\n\nSlow moves to node2.next, which is node1.\n\nFast moves two steps: step one to node1.next (node2), step two to node2.next (node1).\n\nSo slow is node1, fast is node1. They are equal, so return True.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWhat about when there's no cycle? Like a straight linked list.\n\nLet's say three nodes, each pointing to the next, and no cycle.\n\nHead: 1 -> 2 ->3 ->None.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nslow and fast start at 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast: 1.next is 2, then 2.next is 3. So fast is now 3.\n\nCheck if slow == fast? 2 != 3.\n\nNext iteration:\n\nfast is 3, but fast.next is None. So the loop condition is (fast is not None) is true, but (fast.next is not None) is false. So loop breaks. return False.\n\nAnother case: longer list with a cycle not at the end.\n\nLike 1->2->3->4->5, where 5 points back to 3. So a cycle between 3,4,5.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nInitially slow=1, fast=1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow ->2\n\nfast ->1.next (2), then 2.next (3). So fast is3.\n\n2 !=3.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow moves to3.\n\nfast is 3.next is4, then4.next is5. So fast is5.\n\n3 !=5.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nslow moves to4.\n\nfast is 5.next (3), then 3.next (4). So fast is4.\n\nNow, slow is4 and fast is4. So returns True. Correct.\n\nWhat about in a list where the fast catches up before meeting again? I think that theory says that if there's a cycle, the two pointers will meet eventually.\n\nSo implementation steps in code:\n\nIn the function detect_cycle, we get the linked list as an argument.\n\nWe need to check for several things:\n\n1. If the linked list is empty, return False. How? Check if linked_list.head is None.\n\n2. Initialize two pointers: slow and fast.\n\n3. Loop while fast is not None and fast.next is not None.\n\n4. In each loop, move slow by one step, fast by two steps.\n\n5. If at any time slow equals fast, return True.\n\n6. If the loop exits, return False.\n\nBut wait, what if the linked list has 0 nodes? Then head is None, return False.\n\nIf the linked list has only one node, head is not None, but fast and/or fast.next could be None.\n\nLet me write the code step by step.\n\nCode:\n\nFirst, handle the empty list case.\n\nThen, set slow and fast pointers.\n\nThen, the loop:\n\nwhile fast is not None and fast.next is not None:\n\n   slow = slow.next\n\n   fast = fast.next.next\n\n   if slow == fast: return True\n\nContinue.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list: LinkedList) -> bool:\n\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n\n        return False\n\n    slow = linked_list.head\n\n    fast = linked_list.head\n\n    while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:\n\n        slow = slow.next\n\n        fast = fast.next.next\n\n        if slow == fast:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if in the loop, after advancing, one of them is None? Because the while condition just checks at the beginning. So inside the loop, when we do fast = fast.next.next, is that safe?\n\nWait, the condition to enter the loop is that fast is not None and fast.next is not None. So when inside the loop, fast is at least two steps from the end.\n\nWait:\n\nFor example, if fast has two steps available, then in the next step, it's okay because fast.next is not None and fast is not None.\n\nSo during the assignment, slow is moved to next, which could be a problem if slow.next is None. Wait no, because the while condition allows the loop to run only when fast has at least 2 nodes ahead. So for example, in a list of even number of nodes, but no cycle. Let's say 4 nodes. Then fast moves to node4, which is node 3.next. Then slow is node3. Then, the next step is slow moves to node4, fast is None somewhere?\n\nWait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the initial linked list if it's 4 nodes, and no cycle.\n\nLinked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None.\n\nSlow and fast both start at 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow becomes 2.\n\nfast becomes 3 (1.next is 2, then 2.next is 3).\n\nThey are not same.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow becomes 3.\n\nfast becomes 5? Wait no, 3's next is 4, so 3.next is 4. Then next is 4's next, which is None. So fast would be None.\n\nBut wait, in the second iteration, when we enter the loop.\n\nIn the second iteration, fast is at 3, and fast.next is 4 (not None), so condition met.\n\nSo in the loop:\n\nslow becomes 3's next (4).\n\nfast is 3's next (4), then 4's next is None. So fast is None.next? Wait no: fast = fast.next is 4, then fast = 4.next is None. So after that, in assigning fast = fast.next.next, that would be fast = (3.next). So first step:\n\nfast after step 1: 3.next is 4.\n\nstep 2: 4.next is None.\n\nSo fast is None after the second assignment.\n\nSo in next iteration, after the assignments, slow is 4, fast is None.\n\nThey are not equal, so we don't return True.\n\nThen, we proceed to the loop condition: fast is None, so condition not met. We exit the loop and return False.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after we have in the loop:\n\nslow moves, then fast moves two steps. Then check if slow == fast. So this is correct.\n\nAnother test case: linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 1. So a cycle between 1 and 2.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSlow and fast start at 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast moves to 2.next (which is 1), then 1.next is 2. So fast is 2.\n\nSo slow is 2, and fast is 2. So they are same, return True.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: list with one node. Then head is node1, which has next None.\n\nThen, the loop condition is fast (node1) is not None, fast.next (None) is None. So the loop condition fails. So loop doesn't run. Function returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: list has a cycle starting at second node.\n\nLike 1->2->3->4->2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nslow and fast start at 1.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast moves to 1.next (2), then 2.next (3). So fast is 3.\n\nAren't same.\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nslow moves to 3.\n\nfast moves to 3.next (4), then 4.next is 2. So fast is 2.\n\nNot same.\n\n3 is not equal to 2.\n\nThird iteration:\n\nslow is 3's next (4).\n\nfast is 2's next (3), then 3's next (4). So fast is 4.\n\nNow, slow is 4, fast is 4. Equal. Return True.\n\nYes.\n\nSo seems like code is correct.\n\nNow, handling nulls: in the code, in each step, no null pointers, because the condition ensures that fast is not None, and has a next, so the two steps are allowed. Wait, because when you enter the loop, fast is non-null and fast.next is non-null, which implies that fast.next is also not null. So moving fast once is okay, and then again.\n\nWait, no. Because when you assign fast = fast.next.next, it's possible that the next's next is None. But in the loop condition, it's ensured that fast can make two steps. So during the first iteration, after fast is advanced, it's okay.\n\nWait, no:\n\nFor example, a linked list with two nodes: head is 1, next is 2, and next is None.\n\nSo the loop condition is: fast is 1, fast.next is 2. So the condition is met.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast moves: first step is 2, then 2.next is None. So fast becomes None.\n\nThen, after this step,  slow is 2, fast is None: they're not equal.\n\nNo other conditions. Then the loop breaks, function returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother example: list with 3 nodes, 1->2->3->2.\n\nSo node3's next is back to 2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialization: slow and fast are 1.\n\nLoop condition: fast (1) is not null, and fast.next (2) is not null. So enter loop.\n\nslow moves to 2.\n\nfast: 1.next is 2, 2.next is 3. So fast is 3.\n\nCompare, 2 !=3.\n\nLoop continues.\n\nCheck if fast (3) and fast.next (2) are not null.\n\nSo condition is met.\n\nslow moves to 3.\n\nfast: 3's next is 2, 2's next is3. So fast becomes 3.\n\nSo after moving, slow is 3, fast is 3. So returns True. Correct. The loop is present.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nTesting another edge case: an empty list. head is None; return False.\n\nList with one node pointing to itself: head is node1, next is node1.\n\nSo, condition: fast is node1, fast.next is node1 (non-null). So loop runs.\n\nIn first iteration:\n\nslow is node1, moves to next: node1.\n\nfast: first step: node1's next is node1, and then again node1's next is node1. So fast is node1.\n\nSo, after movement, slow is node1, fast is node1. They're equal. So returns True.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, translating this into the function.\n\nBut wait, in the code, slow and fast start at linked_list.head. Then in each step, we move slow and fast.\n\nIn terms of the linked list nodes, is the function correct?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function should be implemented as described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to detect whether a cycle exists in a singly linked list using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm. This algorithm efficiently determines the presence of a cycle with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We are given a singly linked list and need to determine if a cycle exists. A cycle in a linked list means that some node points back to a previous node, creating a loop.\n2. **Intuition**: Floyd's algorithm uses two pointers that move at different speeds. If there is a cycle, the faster pointer will eventually catch up to the slower pointer. If there is no cycle, the faster pointer will reach the end of the list.\n3. **Algorithm Details**:\n   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the linked list.\n   - In each iteration, move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward.\n   - If `slow` and `fast` meet at any point, a cycle exists.\n   - If `fast` reaches the end of the list, no cycle exists.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the list is empty, has only one node, or nodes pointing to themselves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass LinkedList:\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, data=None):\n            self.data = data\n            self.next_node = None\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.head = None\n    \n    def add_node(self, data):\n        if not self.head:\n            self.head = self.Node(data)\n        else:\n            current = self.head\n            while current.next_node:\n                current = current.next_node\n            current.next_node = self.Node(data)\n\ndef detect_cycle(linked_list):\n    if linked_list.head is None:\n        return False\n    slow = linked_list.head\n    fast = linked_list.head\n    while fast is not None and fast.next_node is not None:\n        slow = slow.next_node\n        fast = fast.next_node.next_node\n        if slow == fast:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the linked list is empty. If it is, we return `False` immediately.\n- **Two Pointers Technique**: We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.\n- **Cycle Detection**: Each iteration moves the pointers. If they meet at any point, it indicates a cycle, so we return `True`. If the `fast` pointer reaches the end (`None`), we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently detect cycles in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity, making it suitable for large linked lists up to 10^5 nodes.",
