  "question": "You are tasked with extending the functionality of a given function to not only find the largest power of two less than or equal to a given non-negative integer but also to handle an additional constraint: finding the smallest power of two greater than a given non-negative integer. This new function will be used in scenarios where binary allocations or specific power levels are required.\n\n**Function Signature**: `def find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:`\n\n**Input and Output**:\n- **Input**: A single non-negative integer `number`.\n- **Output**: The smallest power of two greater than the given integer. If the input is 0, return 1.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The input number will be in the range \\(0 \\leq \\text{number} \\leq 10^9\\).\n\n**Performance Requirements**:\n- The function should be efficient and handle the constraints within a reasonable time.\n\n**Scenario**:\nImagine you are working on a system where you need to allocate memory in the form of powers of two.

  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called find_next_power_of_two that takes a non-negative integer and returns the smallest power of two greater than that number. If the input is 0, I return 1.\n\nHmm, let's think about the examples. Like for 0, it's 1. For 1, it's 2. Oh right, because those are the next powers of two after the given number. For 15, the next is 16, and for 16 itself, the next is 32.\n\nSo the task is to find the smallest power of two that's strictly greater than the input number. If the number is already a power of two, then return the next one.\n\nWait, no: for example, 16 is already a power of two (2^4). The next after 16 is 32.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the input is a power of two or not, the function should return the next power greater than it. Except if the number is zero, because 1 is 2^0, but the input is 0 so just return 1.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about how to compute the next power of two. One method is to find the exponent of the next power.\n\nLet's consider the number as N. If N is zero, return 1. Else, find the smallest exponent k such that 2^k > N.\n\nSo, for example, N=5: the exponents start at 2^2=4 (which is less than 5), so next exponent 3 gives 8.\n\nBut how do I find k?\n\nAnother approach is to find the position of the highest set bit in N's binary representation, and then set that bit to the next position. Wait, no, maybe. For example:\n\nTake N=5, which is 101 in binary. The highest bit is at position 3 (assuming we count from 0 as the least significant bit). Then, 2^(pos+1) would be 2^3=8.\n\nWait, but wait: for N=16, which is 10000, highest bit is position 4 (if we consider right to left, zero-based). So 2^(4+1) is 32. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: for N=0, the highest bit is undefined. So for that, we just return 1.\n\nBut how to find the position of the highest set bit.\n\nIn Python, to avoid using built-in functions like bit_length, but oh wait, no\u2014using bit functions is fine as long as I'm not directly calculating exponents.\n\nBut I'm allowed to use bitwise operations.\n\nWait, the note says not to use built-in functions or libraries for calculating powers of two, but perhaps bit manipulation is acceptable. So using bitwise operations to find the next power of two is allowed.\n\nSo, one approach is to compute the next power of two by finding the next highest bit after the highest set bit in the given number.\n\nBut when the number is exactly a power of two, the next power is double it. Like 16 \u2192 32.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the number of bits required to represent (number + 1), and then calculate 2 raised to that number of bits minus one. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can be implemented using bit manipulation.\n\nLet me think about an algorithm.\n\nIf number is 0: return 1.\n\nElse, find the position of the highest set bit, then set all lower bits to zero and add 1, then multiply by 1. Or perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nWait, another way to find the next power is to find the next number after N which is a power of two.\n\nAn efficient way for this is:\n\nCompute the smallest number of the form 2^k such that 2^k > N.\n\nFor this, take the current number. If it's zero, the next is 1.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nFind the position of the highest set bit. That gives us k. Then, the next power is 2^{k+1}, except when the number is exactly a power of two, which would mean that 2^k is equal to N, so next is 2^(k+1).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me see:\n\nExamples:\n\nN=0: return 1.\n\nN=1 (binary 1), highest bit is 0: 2^(0+1)=2.\n\nN=2 (binary 10), highest bit is 1: 2^(2)=4.\n\nWait, but 2 is already a power of two. The next should be 4 in that case. Yes.\n\nAnother example:\n\nN=3: binary 11 \u2192 highest bit is 1 \u2192 2^(1+1)=4.\n\nN=4: binary 100 \u2192 highest bit is 2 \u2192 next is 8.\n\nWait, no. Because N=4 is 2^2, so the next power is 2^3=8. Yes.\n\nWait, but what about cases like N=5: binary 101, highest bit at 2 \u2192 next power is 8 (2^3=8). Which matches the example.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nIf N is zero, return 1.\n\nElse:\n\nFind the position of the highest set bit, which is k.\n\nIf 2^k == N \u2192 return 2^(k+1).\n\nElse, return 2^k.\n\nWait, but wait!\n\nWait, let's test this logic.\n\nCase 1: N=5 (101). Highest set bit is 2 (since 2^2 is 4 and 4 <5). So 2^(3) is 8, which is correct.\n\nCase 2: N=8 (1000). Highest set bit is 3. So since 2^3 is 8, which equals N, we return 2^(4) =16.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute whether 2^k == N?\n\nWait, let's think about another approach.\n\nThe next power after N is 2^(k), where k is the smallest integer such that 2^k > N.\n\nSo to find k, perhaps we can compute as k = floor(log2(N)) + 1.\n\nBut since using log2 is not allowed (we can't use built-in functions for that), we need another way.\n\nSo perhaps using bit manipulation:\n\nIn Python, the bit_length() function returns the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.\n\nSo for example:\n\n0 \u2192 0 bits.\n\n1 \u2192 1.\n\n2 \u2192 2.\n\n3 \u2192 2.\n\n4 \u21923.\n\nWait:\n\nWait, 0's bit_length is 0.\n\n1 is 1 \u2192 1.\n\n2 is 10 \u2192 2.\n\n3 is 11 \u2192 2.\n\n4 is 100 \u21923.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the bit_length of N is the number of bits required to represent N, which is equal to the exponent of the highest power of two plus one minus some.\n\nWait, for N>0:\n\nThe number of bits is k where 2^(k-1) \u2264 N < 2^k.\n\nTherefore, the next power of two after N is 2^k.\n\nBut wait, for N=0, 0's bit_length is 0. So 2^0 is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be:\n\nIf N is 0 \u2192 return 1.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute k = N.bit_length()\n\nThen return 1 << (k) ?\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nN=0 \u2192 bit_length is 0. So 1<<0 is 1. Correct.\n\nN=1: bit_length is 1. 1<<1 is 2. Correct.\n\nN=2: bit_length is 2 \u2192 1<<2 =4. Correct.\n\nN=3: bit_length is 2 \u2192 1<<2 is 4.\n\nN=4: bit_length is 3 \u2192 8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo wait, is it that simple? For any N, the next power is 1 shifted left by the bit_length of N.\n\nWait, for N=5, bit_length is 3 \u2192 8.\n\nN=7: bit_length is3 \u21928.\n\nN=8: bit_length is4 \u219216.\n\nBut what about N=16? Its bit_length is5 \u219216 is 10000, which is 5 bits. So 1<<5 \u219232, correct.\n\nWait, but 16 is 10000 which is 5 bits. So 1<<5 is 32, which is correct.\n\nSo this algorithm works for all N except for zero?\n\nWait, no. Because for N=0, it returns 1, which is correct, but when N=0, the function should return 1.\n\nSo yes:\n\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    k = number.bit_length()\n    return 1 << k\n\nWait, no. Because for example:\n\nIf number is 1, which is 1, bit_length is 1, shifted is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIf number is 2^15, which is 32768. Its bit_length is 16. So 1<<16 is 65536. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: N=1023. Its bit_length is 10. 1 <<10 is 1024 which is correct.\n\nWait, let me code an example.\n\nnumber=5:\n\nbinary is 101, so length is 3 bits. 1<<3 =8. Correct.\n\nnumber=0 \u21921.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 1 << number.bit_length()\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me test with the example when the number is 1.\n\nnumber=1 \u2192bit_length is1 \u21921<<1 is 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nBut what about when the number is larger than that.\n\nWait, so for number=2, which is 10, bit_length is 2, 1<<2=4.\n\nBut 2 is already a power of two, so the next is 4. So yes.\n\nBut wait, no, because if the number is equal to 2^(k), the next is 2^(k+1).\n\nWait, no: for number=2, the next is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo the function seems to correctly handle all cases, including when the number is exactly a power of two.\n\nWait, let's see for number=4: 100, bit_length is3. 1<<3=8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo in all test cases, this function works.\n\nWait, but why? Because 2^(bit_length()) is the next power.\n\nYes, because for N>0, the bit_length is the number of bits in N, and always, 2^(bit_length) is the next power of two after N.\n\nWait, what about N=7: bit_length is3. 2^3 is8. So yes.\n\nSo in code, it's correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement, in the sample input, number=16:\n\n16.bit_length is 5 (because 16 is 10000, which is 5 bits). So 32 is 100000 \u2192 1<<5 is32.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWait, sample:\n\nSample 1: assert find_next_power_of_two(0) == 1 \u2192 code returns 1.\n\nSample 2: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nSample3:15 is 4 bits (1111), 1<<4 =16 \u2192 correct.\n\nSample4:16 \u21925 bits \u219232.\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about when number is 1<<30, which is a large number.\n\nLet me think: 1<<30 is about a billion, so in 32-bit integer, the code should handle it.\n\nThus, the solution is to return 1<<number.bit_length() for numbers greater than zero. Else, return 1.\n\nSo the function is simple.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 1 << number.bit_length()\n\nDoes that work?\n\nWait, but wait for number 1:\n\nnumber is 1, bit_length is1 \u21921 <<1 =2. Correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the number is 3:\n\nbinary 11 \u2192 two bits. 1 <<2 =4. Correct.\n\nBut what about a number that is one less than a power of two, say 2^k -1:\n\nFor example, number=7:2^3-1=7.\n\nbit_length is3 \u21921<<3=8. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the function should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest power of two greater than a given non-negative integer. This function is useful in scenarios where memory or resources need to be allocated in powers of two.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently involves leveraging bit manipulation. The key insight is that the next power of two greater than a given number can be determined by examining the binary representation of the number. Specifically, the number of bits required to represent the number in binary helps us determine the next power of two.\n\n- If the input number is 0, the next power of two is 1.\n- For any other number, we use the `bit_length()` method to find the number of bits required to represent the number in binary. This gives us the exponent of the next power of two, which we then compute using a left shift operation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 1 << number.bit_length()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If the input number is 0, we directly return 1 as the result because the smallest power of two greater than 0 is 1.\n2. **Bit Length Calculation**: For any non-zero number, we use the `bit_length()` method. This method returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary. For example, the number 5 (binary 101) has a bit length of 3.\n3. **Next Power Calculation**: The result of `bit_length()` gives us the exponent for the next power of two. We compute this power using the left shift operation. For example, if `bit_length()` returns 3, we compute \\(2^3\\) as `1 << 3`, which equals 8.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the range of input values up to \\(10^9\\) by utilizing bitwise operations, which are both time and space efficient.",
