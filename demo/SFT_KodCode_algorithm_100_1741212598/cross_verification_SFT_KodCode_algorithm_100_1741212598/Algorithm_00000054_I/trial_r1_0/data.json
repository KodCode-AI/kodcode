A unimodal list is defined as a list that increases to a point and then decreases.

  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the peak element in a unimodal list. Hmm, wait, what's a unimodal list? Oh right, it's a list that strictly increases to a peak and then strictly decreases. But wait, the problem says a unimodal list is defined as a list that increases to a point and then decreases. Oh right, the function should return None if the input doesn\u2019t follow this pattern strictly.\n\nWait, so the list should first increase and then decrease. So, for example, [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1] is good because it increases up to 5 and then decreases. But a list like [1,3,2,3,4] is not because after 3 increases to 4, it doesn't then decrease. Oh wait, no. Let me think: after the peak, the list must decrease. So after the peak, any increase would break the pattern.\n\nSo, the function needs to check if the list is strictly increasing up to a point, then strictly decreasing after that point, with the point being the peak. Or wait, is non-strictly increasing or decreasing acceptable? Because the constraints mention that the list can contain duplicates. Oh, but the peak is the maximum and duplicates could be in the increasing or decreasing parts, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait looking at the examples:\n\nIn the example [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2], the peak is 2, and it increases up to 2, and then decreases. But the example function returns 2, which is the first occurrence. So perhaps the list can have duplicates in the increasing or decreasing part.\n\nWait the function's task is to find the peak, which is the maximum value in the unimodal list. So, if the list is not unimodal, return None.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to find the peak and ensure that the list strictly increases up to the peak and then strictly decreases after it. Or wait, perhaps not strictly, maybe non-decreasing and non-increasing would suffice? Because looking at the example where [1,2,2,1...], the function returns 2. So the increases part can have duplicates as long as it's non-decreasing up to the peak, and then non-increasing after.\n\nWait, but wait the problem says a unimodal list is defined as increases to a peak then decreases. So not exactly sure about strictness\u2014probably, the list can have plateaus but the overall increase then decrease structure must be there.\n\nBut to clarify: the function needs to verify two main points: before the peak, the sequence is non-decreasing (since if it were decreasing anywhere before the peak, and then increased, that would contradict), and after the peak, it's non-increasing.\n\nWait no, because if it's non-decreasing up to the peak and then non-increasing after, that would form a unimodal mountain. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the index where the maximum occurs, then check that all elements before it are non-decreasing and after are non-increasing. If that's the case, the function can return it; else, return None.\n\nBut how about when there are multiple peaks? Like, several maxima in the list not connected. Then the list is not unimodal. So, for example, [1,3,2,3,1] is not unimodal because after the first peak (3 at index 1) it decreases, then increases again, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the approach is: find all possible peaks, then for each peak candidate, verify that the list is non-decreasing before the peak and non-increasing after. Wait, but how to handle if the peak is at the start or end?\n\nAh right, the peak could be the first element (only if the list is non-increasing) or the last (only if the list is non-decreasing). Or wait, what's the definition in that case.\n\nBut according to the examples, for [1,10,9,8,7,6,5,4], the peak is 10. So in this case, after that it's strictly decreasing. Similarly, [1, 9, 8,7] has 9 as the peak. So if the peak is at index 0 (like [5,4,3,2,1]), then it's acceptable. But if the first element is the maximum and the list starts with [5,5,4,3], then after the peak, which is at index 0 or 1, they are non-increasing.\n\nWait in the example [1,1], the function returns 1. So that's allowed\u2014 seems like single peak or even the entire list is flat, but the maximum is 1. Wait wait, no. The list length is 2, both elements are 1. So yes, it's unimodal\u2014increasing leading up to the peak (none, as it's the same) and then decreasing (also same). So the function can return 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Identify the peak position(s).\n\nBut how to efficiently find the peak when the list can be up to 1e6 elements.\n\nWait, but if I do a binary search approach.\n\nAnother approach:\n\nSince the list is supposed to be unimodal, it has exactly one peak. So, the maximum element occurs at the peak, which is the point where the elements before it are non-decreasing, and after are non-increasing.\n\nHmm, but wait: in a unimodal list, the maximum is the highest point, so it's the peak.\n\nSo, the idea is: find the maximum value, then check if all elements before it are non-decreasing, and all elements after are non-increasing.\n\nWait, but that might not work because if there are multiple instances of the maximum, like in a list [1,3,3,2], the peak could be at index 1 or 2. So in such a case, the list is still unimodal because before the first 3, it's increasing, and after the second 3, it's decreasing.\n\nSo, to find the peak, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find all indices where the maximum occurs.\n\n- For each maximum index, check that all elements before it are non-decreasing and all elements after are non-increasing.\n\n- If exactly one such index exists, return it. Otherwise, return None.\n\nBut this approach would be O(n) for each peak candidate, leading to O(n) time, which for 1e6 is manageable.\n\nWait, but the performance requirement is O(log n). So this approach is O(n), which is acceptable, but perhaps there's a way to do better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the peak via binary search.\n\nWait, how does binary search apply here.\n\nWait, in a unimodal list, the peak is where the list increases to a point and then decreases. So, in such a list, using a modified binary search approach can find the peak in O(log n) time.\n\nBut this is assuming that the list is strictly unimodal. Once we find the peak via binary search, we still need to verify that the entire list is unimodal\u2014i.e., that all elements before the peak are non-decreasing, and all elements after are non-increasing.\n\nHmm. So steps could be:\n\n1. Find a candidate peak using binary search. This can be done in O(log n) time.\n\n2. Then, verify that the entire list is non-decreasing up to that peak and non-increasing after.\n\n3. If this is true, return the peak; else, return None.\n\nSo, the candidate peak is where the elements switch from being increasing to decreasing. But how to handle when the maximum is at multiple indices.\n\nWait, perhaps this binary search method to find the peak.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach:\n\n- The peak is at index k such that lst[k] is greater than or equal to neighbors.\n\nWait, not exactly\u2014because some elements before can be equal, but the overall trend is non-decreasing before, and non-increasing after.\n\nWait but the peak is clearly the maximum of the list\u2014so perhaps the approach is to find the maximum value, and then find the earliest index where that maximum occurs, then check the non-decreasing before and after.\n\nWait, but for a list like [1, 3, 5, 5, 4], the maximum is 5, and occurs at index 2 and 3.\n\nThe peak is index 2 and 3. So checking index 2: elements before are [1,3,5]\u2014all good, increasing. Elements after are [5,4]\u2014are they non-increasing? 5 to 5 is non-increasing, then 4 is less than 5\u2014so yes. So for index 3, elements after are [4]\u2014also good.\n\nSo, as long as the maximum is a single contiguous block, the list is unimodal.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find the maximum value in the list.\n\n- Find the first occurrence of this maximum.\n\n- Then, verify that all elements before this index are non-decreasing and all elements after are non-increasing.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of the maximum? Because in a list with multiple maxima, there would be a range of indices where the max occurs.\n\nThen, the list must be non-decreasing up to the first max index, and non-increasing after the last max index.\n\nWait, no. Because in the example [1,3,5,5,4,3], the first max index is 2, and the last is 3. So elements before 2 are non-decreasing (1,3,5 and 5), wait, the list before 2 is just 1 and 3, which are non-decreasing. Then, from index 3 onwards, it's 5,4,3\u2014so non-increasing.\n\nSo, if we pick the earliest max index and check that from 0 to that index, the list is non-decreasing, and from that index onwards, non-increasing, then that could be enough.\n\nWait, but no: suppose there's a point after the earliest maximum that is higher than the next elements. But since all those elements are equal to the maximum, perhaps not.\n\nHmm. Let me think of some test cases.\n\nWait, for example, the first test case is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Max is 5, and the first occurrence is at index 4. All before are non-decreasing, and after are non-increasing.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0], the max is 2, at index 1 and 2. So earliest is 1. Check before 1: 1 to 2 is increasing. After 1: check 2,1,0. Are they non-increasing? Yes.\n\nBut what about a list where the max occurs multiple times, but after a decrease and then increase again. Like [1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5], is that unimodal? Well, in this case, the maximum is 5, occurs at multiple indices, but after a decrease (4) there's an increase again. So the list is not unimodal.\n\nSo, in that case, the function should return None.\n\nSo, the approach for the function could be:\n\n1. Find the maximum value of the list.\n\n2. Find all the indices where this maximum occurs.\n\n   For example, indices could be [i, i+1, ..., j]\n\n3. Then, check two things:\n\n   a) From the start to the first occurrence of the maximum, the elements are non-decreasing.\n\n   b) From the last occurrence of the maximum to the end, the elements are non-increasing.\n\n4. If both a and b are true, then return the maximum value. Else, return None.\n\nThis approach could work. Let's see why.\n\nBecause the maximum is in a contiguous block. So, before the first maximum, the elements are non-decreasing. After the last maximum, the elements are non-increasing. So the entire list is non-decreasing until the first max, remains at max (possibly for multiple elements), then transitions to non-increasing. So it's a single, broad peak, which is still considered a unimodal list.\n\nSo, how to implement this:\n\nFind the maximum value, find the first and last index where this maximum occurs.\n\nThen, check the non-decreasing from 0 to first index.\n\nThen, check the non-increasing from last index to end.\n\nAdditionally, the part between the first and last index must be all max values. Because in the examples given, this is allowed.\n\nWait, for example, in [1, 5, 5, 5, 4], the maximum is 5, first index 1, last index 3. So, from first to last, all are 5s. Then, ahead of last index, 4. So it's acceptable.\n\nSo, to proceed:\n\nFirst, find the maximum value. Then find first_max and last_max. Then, check that all elements from 0 to first_max are <= next (non-decreasing). From last_max to end must be non-increasing.\n\nNow, code-wise, I can do the following:\n\nIn Python, to find the maximum of the list is easy: max_val = max(lst)\n\nThen, find first_max as the first index where lst[i] == max_val.\n\nSimilarly, find last_max as the last index where lst[i] == max_val.\n\nThen, for the elements before first_max:\n\nCheck that each element is <= the next one. Because if there is a point where the element is larger than the next, it's not non-decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, after last_max, each element must be <= the previous one.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it into steps:\n\ndef find_peak(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return None  # though constraints say len >=1?\n    max_val = max(lst)\n    first_max = lst.index(max_val)\n    last_max = len(lst) - 1 - lst[::-1].index(max_val)\n    \n    # Check if the part before first_max is non-decreasing\n    for i in range(first_max):\n        if lst[i] > lst[i+1]:\n            return None\n    # Check if the part after last_max is non-increasing\n    for i in range(last_max, len(lst)-1):\n        if lst[i] < lst[i+1]:\n            return None\n    # Also, check that all elements from first_max to last_max are max_val\n    for i in range(first_max, last_max+1):\n        if lst[i] != max_val:\n            return None\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but in the first for loop, for i in 0 to first_max -1:\n\nWe check if lst[i] > lst[i+1]. If any of these conditions are true, then the pre-max part is not non-decreasing. So return None.\n\nSimilarly, for the post-max parts.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the peak is at the start or end?\n\nLike, [3,2,1]: first_max is 0. So the for loop for pre-max is 0 to -1 (not running), which is fine. The post loop runs from 0 to len(lst)-2 (since len(lst) is 3: 0,1). So for i=0, check if lst[0] < lst[1]. 3 < 2? No. Then for i=1, 2 < 1? No. So it's okay.\n\nSimilarly, if the list is [1,2,3], then first_max is 2 (since 3 is max). The post loop would run for i=2 to len(lst)-2 (which is 2 to 1: loop doesn't run. So it's okay.\n\nBut in the function above, after the for loops, the function will return max_val. So in the examples, that works.\n\nWait. But what about a list like [1,3,3,2,3]\u2014then the max is 3, first_max is 1, last_max is 3.\n\nSo the pre part for indexes 0: 1 < 3: okay.\n\nThen, in the post loop:\n\nfrom index 3 to 4: lst[3] is 3, lst[4] is 2?\n\nWait, no: the list is [1,3,3,2,3]. So first_max is 1, last_max is 4.\n\nThe for loop for the pre part is from 0 to 0: check if lst[0] <= lst[1]: ok.\n\nThe for loop for post is from 4 to 3 (not running), so it's okay.\n\nBut then, in the middle, after first_max comes indexes 2, 3, etc. Are all the elements between first_max and last_max equal to max_val?\n\nNo: in this case, indexes 1,2: 3, but then index3 is 2, which is less than max_val. So the code as written would see that the middle element(s) between first_max and last_max are not equal to max_val, and thus return None. Which is correct, because the list is not unimodal.\n\nWait no, because in [1,3,3,2,3], the maximum is 3, and the function as per current code would have first_max as 1 and last_max as 4.\n\nSo between 1 and 4 are elements at indexes 2,3: 3 and 2.\n\nSo the loop:\n\nfor i in range(1,4+1):\n\ni goes from 1 to 4 (inclusive). At i=3, lst[3] is 2 != max_val. So the function returns None.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in another case, say [1,5,5,5,4], the elements between first_max and last_max (indexes 1-3) are 5,5,5, so the function is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the approach with the given sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\nmax is 5. first_max is 4, last_max is4.\n\npre: from 0 to 3: [1,2,3,4] are non-decreasing. Checks out.\npost: from 4 to 8: [5,4,3,2,1] are non-increasing. Checks out.\nSo returns 5.\n\nSample 2:\n[1,10,9,8,7,6,5,4]\nmax is10. first and last_max is1.\n\npre: [1] to 10 is increasing. Checks out.\npost: 10,9,8,... are decreasing. So returns 10.\n\nSample 3:\n[1, 9, 8,7]\nmax is9. first and last_max is1.\npre: 1<=9: yes.\npost:9>8>7: yes.\nreturns9.\n\nSample4:\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0]\nmax is7. first index 6, last index none.\n\nWait, len(lst) is 8. lst[6] is7, lst[7] is0.\n\nmax is7. first_max is 6? No, because:\n\nlst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0]\nmax_val is7. index(7) returns 6. so first_max is6.\n\nlast_max: reversed list is [0,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], so index of7 is0. So last_max =8-1-0=7-0=7? Wait wait.\n\nWait len(lst) is 8. So when considering the reversed list, if the max is at position len(lst) -1 - index_in_reversed.\n\nWait, for the sample4, the max is7, which is at index6. in the reversed list, it's [0,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. So index of 7 is index1, because the reversed list is [0,7,6,5,4,3,2,1].\n\nSo last_max = len(lst)-1 - 1 =7-1 -1 =5? Wait no, original list's last_max is6. So perhaps I'm not calculating last_max correctly.\n\nWait, yes, perhaps my approach to find last_max is wrong.\n\nWait for the list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0], the last_max is 6.\n\nThe reversed list is [0,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. So the first occurrence in reversed list is 0. So for reversed list, the index is0. So len(lst) is8.\n\nlast_max = len(lst) -1 - reversed_list.index(max_val). So 7 - reversed_list.index(7).\n\nReversed list starts as0,7,6,5, etc. So the reversed_list.index(7) is1.\n\nSo last_max is7 -1=6, which is correct.\n\nYes, in this case, it's correct.\n\nSo in the code, it's correct.\n\nThus, in sample4:\n\npre (from 0 to5) elements are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Are they non-decreasing? Yes.\n\npost (from6 to7):\n\nelements are7,0. Is7>=0? Yes, so the post part is non-increasing.\n\nAlso, the elements between 6 and6 is just 7. So the function returns7.\n\nAnother sample: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,0,-1,-2].\n\nmax is4, first and last_max is3.\n\npre:1<=2<=3<=4: yes.\n\npost:4 to the rest is decreasing.\n\nSo function returns4.\n\nAnother sample: [1,2,2,1,0,-1,-2].\n\nmax is2.\n\nfirst_max is index1 (lst[1]=2).\n\nlast_max is index2.\n\npre: 0 to0:1<=2: yes.\n\npost: from2 to6:2,1,0,-1,-2: is it non-increasing? 2 >=1 >=0 >=-1 >=-2: yes.\n\nAdditionally, the elements between1 and2 are all 2's.\n\nSo function returns2.\n\nAnother sample: [1,1]. function returns1.\n\nAnother sample: [1]. returns1.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0]\n\nyes, as sample4 discussed.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,11,10]\n\nmax is12. first and last at index11.\n\npre:1-11: increasing.\n\npost:12,11,10: decreasing.\n\nSo function returns12.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,11,10,9]\n\nSame logic: function returns12.\n\nSo seems all test cases are covered.\n\nNow, what about edge cases.\n\nTest case: [5,4,3,2,1,2]. The max is5.\n\nfirst_max is0. So pre: no elements. So pre is okay.\n\npost:5>4>3>2>1>2. Wait: in post, elements after 0 are4,3,2,1,2. So from 0, check that lst[i] >= next.\n\nSo i=0:4 >=4? 4 is not >=4, it's equal. Wait, no, i=0 is the end of the post loop. Wait, the code's post loop runs from last_max (0) to len(lst)-2, which is5-1=4, len-1 is5. So in this case, for i in 0 to4:\n\nCheck lst[i] >= lst[i+1].\n\ni=0:5 >=4: yes.\n\ni=1:4 >=3: yes.\n\ni=2:3 >=2: yes.\n\ni=3:2 >=1: yes.\n\ni=4:1 >=2? 1 >=2 is false.\n\nSo in the post loop, the code will find this and return None.\n\nWhich is correct because the list is not unimodal.\n\nBecause after the peak (5 at index0), the list can have a point where it increases again, so this is invalid.\n\nAnother test case: [2,2,2,2]. max is2, first and last maxes are0 and3.\n\npre: fori 0: elements before are0, which is none, but the code loops i in 0 (since first_max is0). Wait no: first_max is0.\n\nSo pre loop runs for i in 0: nothing, because range(first_max) is range(0) which is empty.\n\nPost loop runs from3 to3: checks if lst[3] >= lst[4]\u2014 but since len is4, i runs up to 3, and i+1 is4 which is index 3+1=4, which is beyond the list. So perhaps in the code, the for loop for the post part is for i in range(last_max, len(lst)-1).\n\nIn the test case [2,2,2,2], len is4. So len(lst)-1 is3.\n\nSo the for loop runs for i=3, but then i+1 is4, which is out of range. So no iteration occurs. So it's okay.\n\nSo the pre part is ok, post is ok.\n\nThe code will return2.\n\nWhich is correct\u2014this list is non-decreasing and has a single peak (all elements are same), so it's considered unimodal.\n\nAnother edge case: [3,2,2,2]. So function correctly returns3?\n\nWait, no.\n\nLet me see: [3,2,2,2]. The peak is at0.\n\npre is no elements, so ok.\n\npost after0: 2,2,2. They are non-increasing, and all are2. Are they?\n\nSo in the post loop, for each i in 0,1,2 (since last_max=0, and len(lst)-1=3-1=2? Wait no:\n\nWait len(lst) is4, len(lst)-1 is3.\n\nso the loop is from0 to3-1=2.\n\nso i=0: 3>2: yes.\n\ni=1:2>2: no. 2 is not less than 2, thus the condition is whether lst[i] < lst[i+1]. Since len([3,2,2,2]).\n\nWait, the element at i=1 is 2 and i+1=2 is also 2. So in the post loop, condition (lst[i] < lst[i+1]) is 2<2: false. So the loop continues.\n\nWait no, wait the post loop condition is:\n\nFor all i from last_max to len(lst)-2: if lst[i] < lst[i+1], return None.\n\nSo in this case:\n\nlast_max =0.\n\ni runs 0,1,2.\n\ni=0: 3<2? No.\n\ni=1:2<2? No.\n\ni=2:2<2? No.\n\nSo the loop does not find any condition, so post part is ok.\n\nThen, the function proceeds to check that the elements between first_max and last_max are all max_val.\n\nWhich in this case is0, and elements in this range (0-0) is3, which is the max_val.\n\nSo returns3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: [3,4,3,4]. Not unimodal.\n\nBecause [3,4,3,4]. The max is4.\n\nFirst_max is index1.\n\nLast_max is index3.\n\npre: 3<=4: yes.\n\npost: 4,3,4.\n\nFor i in 3: lst[3] is4, which is last index. But the post loop will check whether 3 is <=4. Because in the list, after last_max (3) there are no elements beyond (since the list ends there). Hmm, yes.\n\nWait wait, in this case, the last_max is3. So in the post loop:\n\nfor i in 3 to 3 (because len(lst)=4, len(lst)-2=2):\n\nSo in this case, i=3 is beyond the loop's range. So post parts are considered okay.\n\nThen, in the between elements check:\n\nfirst_max=1, last_max=3.\n\nelements at1,2,3 are4,3,4.\n\nso element2 is3, which is less than the max_val (4). So the function returns None.\n\nSo, this list [3,4,3,4] is correctly considered non-unimodal.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nThus, now writing the function.\n\nSo steps in function:\n\n1. Compute the maximum value.\n\n2. Compute first_max as the first occurrence of max_value.\n\n3. Compute last_max as len(lst) -1 - reversed_list.index(max_val).\n\n4. Check that all elements before first_max are non-decreasing.\n\n   Loop from 0 to first_max-1:\n\n      if lst[i] > lst[i+1], return None.\n\n5. Check that all elements after last_max are non-increasing.\n\n   For i from last_max to len(lst)-2:\n\n      if lst[i] < lst[i+1], return None.\n\n6. Check that all elements from first_max to last_max are equal to max value.\n\n   for i in range(first_max, last_max +1):\n\n      if lst[i] != max_val:\n\n          return None\n\n7. return max_val\n\nSo, coding this.\n\nNow, considering time constraints.\n\nThe function makes two for loops for pre and post, each of which is O(n) time. The middle for loop is (last_max - first_max +1) steps, which can be O(n) in the worst case.\n\nThus, the overall time could be O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nNow, handling the case where the list has len 0: but according to constraints, len is >=1.\n\nAlso, for the case where the list has len 1: first_max is0, last_max is0.\n\nthe pre is checked: no loop. post: no loop. middle is i=0: ok. return lst[0].\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the list is all elements same.\n\nE.g., [5,5,5,5,5]. Then function:\n\nmax_val=5.\n\nfirst_max=0.\n\nlast_max = len(lst)-1=4.\n\npre loop: check from0-0: nothing.\n\npost loop: check 4, but len(lst)-2 is3: loop i=4 is4 >3? no. So not looping.\n\nmiddle loop: check0-4: all 5. So yes.\n\nThus returns5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,3,5]. Max is5. first_max 0, last_max4.\n\npre loop: 0-0: no check.\n\nmiddle loop: i=0 to4.\n\nlst[0]=5, 1=5, 2=5,3=3: !=5. So function returns None.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given list of integers is unimodal and find its peak element. A unimodal list is defined as a list that strictly increases to a peak and then strictly decreases. If the list does not follow this pattern, the function should return `None`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Maximum Value**: The peak element is the maximum value in the list.\n2. **Determine the First and Last Occurrences of the Maximum Value**: These occurrences define the range where the peak should be located.\n3. **Check Non-Decreasing Order Before the First Peak**: Ensure all elements before the first occurrence of the maximum value are non-decreasing.\n4. **Check Non-Increasing Order After the Last Peak**: Ensure all elements after the last occurrence of the maximum value are non-increasing.\n5. **Validate Peak Consistency**: Ensure all elements between the first and last occurrence of the maximum value are equal to the maximum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\ndef find_peak(lst: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:\n    if not lst:\n        return None  # According to constraints, len(lst) >= 1, so this might be redundant\n    \n    max_val = max(lst)\n    first_max = lst.index(max_val)\n    reversed_max_index = lst[::-1].index(max_val)\n    last_max = len(lst) - 1 - reversed_max_index\n    \n    # Check non-decreasing from start to first_max (exclusive)\n    for i in range(first_max):\n        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n            return None\n    \n    # Check non-increasing from last_max (inclusive) to end\n    for i in range(last_max, len(lst) - 1):\n        if lst[i] < lst[i + 1]:\n            return None\n    \n    # Check all elements from first_max to last_max are max_val\n    for i in range(first_max, last_max + 1):\n        if lst[i] != max_val:\n            return None\n    \n    return max_val\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Maximum Value**: The maximum value in the list is determined using the `max` function.\n2. **Find Indices**: The first occurrence of the maximum value is found using `index`, and the last occurrence is found by reversing the list and using `index` again, adjusting for the reversed position.\n3. **Check Non-Decreasing Before First Peak**: Loop through the elements before the first occurrence of the maximum value to ensure they are in non-decreasing order.\n4. **Check Non-Increasing After Last Peak**: Loop through the elements after the last occurrence of the maximum value to ensure they are in non-increasing order.\n5. **Validate Peak Consistency**: Ensure all elements between the first and last occurrence of the maximum value are equal to the maximum value to confirm the peak's consistency.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions to determine if the list is unimodal and returns the peak element if valid, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
