  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement an in-place quick sort algorithm in Python. The function is called quick_sort_in_place and it takes a list of integers as an argument. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\nWait, but the original code uses a simple random pivot selection. Oh right, and doesn't handle in-place sorting. My task is to modify this. So I need to make the function sort the list in-place. That means I shouldn't be creating new lists for the elements less than or greater than the pivot, but instead rearrange the elements within the existing list.\n\nHmm, so for in-place quick sort, I need a helper function that performs the partitioning and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\nWhat about the edge cases? I should handle them. For example, if the list is empty or has one element, it's already sorted. Also, for nearly sorted lists, a poor pivot selection could lead to O(n^2) time, which is bad. So to avoid worst-case performance, I need a better pivot selection strategy.\n\nOh right, the problem statement says to use the \"median-of-three\" pivot selection. So I should implement that. The median of three would select the middle value among the first, middle, and last elements of the array. Or wait, maybe among the first, middle, and end elements. That should help avoid cases where the array is nearly sorted.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Base case: If the array has 0 or 1 element, return.\n2. Select the pivot using the median-of-three method.\n3. Partition the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot.\n4. Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays.\n5. Do this all in-place.\n\nWait, partitioning in place is a bit tricky. How does the partitioning work? I remember the standard in-place partition where we have a low, high, and pivot index.\n\nLet me think about partitioning. Let's say I have a function that takes the array, a low index, and a high index, and selects a pivot within that range. Then it rearranges the elements so that all elements less than the pivot are to its left, equal to the right, and greater to the far right. Or maybe it's less than, and greater than, so that we can recursively sort each partition.\n\nWait, I think in in-place quick sort, the idea is to select a pivot and then move elements such that all elements <= pivot are on one side, and > pivot on the other. But in some implementations, it's =< and >.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to swap elements to arrange the pivot into its correct position, with all smaller elements on the left and larger on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps using a helper function like _partition which returns the pivot index. Then, we recursively call quicksort on the left and right partitions.\n\nSo the overall structure could look like:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr):\n    _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr)-1)\n\ndef _quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    if low >= high:\n        return  # base case\n    # select pivot\n    pivot_index = _select_pivot(arr, low, high)\n    # swap pivot to the end (or in place)\n    # wait, I need to make a function that partitions\n    # into elements <= pivot and > pivot, and returns the pivot position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have the _partition function called from _quick_sort, which does the partitioning and returns the new pivot index. Then _quick_sort is called recursively on the sub-arrays.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned about the in-place approach. Let me think about the partition scheme.\n\nI've heard of the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a variation that is slightly faster and more efficient in practice. It's used in the standard implementations. So maybe I'll use that.\n\nThe Lomuto partition works as follows:\n\n- Select a pivot (maybe the last element).\n- Initialize two pointers, i and j, such that i starts at low-1, and j starts at low.\n- Iterate j from low to high:\n   - if arr[j] < arr[pivot], increment i, swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n- Swap arr[i+1] and arr[high] (the pivot)\n- Return i+1 as the new pivot index.\n\nWait, no. In Lomuto, maybe the pivot is at the end. Let's think:\n\nIn Lomuto partition, given a range in the array (low to high), the function rearranges the array such that all elements <= the pivot (arr[high]) are to the left of the pivot, and the pivot is in its final position. The function will return the index where the pivot was placed.\n\nSo how does that help with the in-place quick sort? Let's say we can select any element as the pivot, swap it to the end, then partition. Then, the swap makes the pivot at high, and then after partition, it's in the correct place.\n\nWait but for median-of-three, I should first select the pivot, then swap it to a position where the partitioning can take place correctly. Maybe to the middle or the end.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: when selecting the median of three elements, let's swap that pivot into place (say, position high) and then perform the standard Lomuto partition.\n\nSo the _partition function would handle moving the pivot and returning the new position.\n\nSo putting it together, the steps are:\n\n1. If low < high, select the pivot using median-of-three.\n2. Partition the array into elements <= pivot and elements > pivot, placing the pivot in its correct position.\n3. Recursively call _quick_sort on the left and right subarrays.\n\nSo I need to implement the _select_pivot function, which for a given array segment (from low to high), finds the median of the first, middle, and last elements.\n\nWait, but for a segment, low to high, the middle index is (low + high) // 2. For example, in 0-based indexing, in a segment of length 5, indices 0,1,2,3,4. Middle is 2.\n\nWait, if low is inclusive and high is inclusive, then for a range from low to high, the middle index is (low + high) // 2.\n\nSo, when the current segment is from low=0 to high=9 (length 10), the first element is 0, the last is 9. The middle is (0+9)//2 =4.\n\nSo for the segment between low and high, the first is arr[low], the middle is arr[mid], the last is arr[high]. Then, the median is the middle value of these three elements.\n\nSo in code, when given low and high, the functions compares the three elements and decides which is the median, then figures out the index of that median. Then, it swaps that median element with one of the ends, perhaps with high, so that it can be placed in the correct position.\n\nWait, does the median need to be swapped to the end before partitioning? Because in Lomuto, the pivot is at the end before partitioning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to swap the obtained median into the high position, so that the Lomuto partition can be applied.\n\nSo here's how this might work:\n\nIn _quick_sort, for the current range [low, high], we do:\n\n- If low >= high: return.\n- Else, select the pivot using median-of-three. Let's say after selecting, the pivot is at position p. We then swap it with high, so p is at high.\n- Then, call the _partition function which takes low, high (pivot at high), and returns the new pivot position.\n- Then, recursively sort the left and right sub-arrays.\n\nWait, but how does _partition handle it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps _partition always expects the pivot to be at high, swap the elements correctly, and return the final pivot position. So after selecting the pivot using median of three, we bring it to the high position, then call _partition.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Select m, the median value of the three: arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high].\n2. Find its index among the three, then swap it with arr[high].\n3. Call _partition on the array with pivot at high. The _partition function will rearrange the array such that the pivot is placed in its correct position, with all elements before it <= pivot, and elements after it >= pivot. Or wait, because equal elements are being handled, but maybe that's up to the partition function.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about whether the function takes care of elements equal to the pivot.\n\nHmm. So, in the _partition function, what does it do?\n\nIn Lomuto's partition, the pivot is at the end. It starts by i = low -1. During the partition, it iterates j from low to high:\n\nif arr[j] <= pivot, swap with i+1 and i++. Then, after the loop, swap the pivot to i+1 position.\n\nSo the pivot ends at i+1, elements <= pivot are before it (from low to i), and elements >= pivot are after (from i+1+1 to high). So recursively, the function sorts the left and right partitions.\n\nTherefore, I need to implement this Lomuto partition.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nImplement the _quick_sort function which, given a segment, selects the pivot as the median of three in that segment, brings the pivot to the high position, then partitions the array to place the pivot in its correct position, then recursively sorts the left and right segments.\n\nNow, handling the in-place part: all the swapping must be done in the array itself, without creating new lists.\n\nNow, what about the base cases? For the quick_sort_in_place function, when the list has 0 or 1 element, we return immediately. But in the _quick_sort function, if low >= high, return.\n\nSo, all right.\n\nNow, coding this step by step.\n\nFirst, the function signature is given, which is:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr: list) -> None:\n    # code\n\nWe need to implement this function.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the array is empty or has one element. If len(arr) is 0, return. If len(arr) is 1, return. Else, call the helper function.\n\nWait, len(arr) is not handled inside the helper as it's given, because the helper will be called for subarrays.\n\nWait, no. For the helper, it's given the high and low indices. So in the initial call, it's low=0, high=len(arr)-1. Then the helper will check if low >= high, which it's not, so it proceeds.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to handle that base in the helper function.\n\nSo, perhaps the quick_sort_in_place function will directly call the helper function _quick_sort, without doing any base case checks.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to handle in the helper.\n\nHmm, but the helper is called with low and high, so the initial call is from the main function, checking if the array is empty or single-element.\n\nWait, no. Because the helper function is called regardless. Maybe it's better to make the helper handle all cases. So inside _quick_sort, the first thing is: if low >= high: return.\n\nSo, in the main function, it's as simple as checking len(arr) ==0 , but perhaps it's not necessary since the helper will return right away.\n\nBut let's see. For very small arrays, like length 0 or 1, the helper function will immediately return, so perhaps the main function doesn't need to check. It can just call _quick_sort, which will do nothing.\n\nSo the quick_sort_in_place function can be:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr):\n    _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr)-1)\n\ndef _quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    if low >= high:\n        return\n    # select pivot as the median of three\n    # bring that pivot to high\n    # partition\n    # recursively call _quick_sort on left and right\n\nNow, implement select_pivot and the partition.\n\nWait, but the problem states to avoid worst-case performance by using median-of-three pivot selection. I'm not sure if other methods may cause the code to fail for specific test cases.\n\nSo now, for the select pivot step:\n\nImplement a function that, given the array and low and high indices, selects the median of the first, middle, and last elements.\n\nBut wait, the first is arr[low], the middle is arr[mid], the last is arr[high]. The mid index is (low + high) // 2.\n\nCompute the mid index as mid = (low + high) // 2.\n\nCompare the three values and find which is the median. For example, if the values are a, b, c, the median is the one that is neither the largest nor the smallest.\n\nWait, but in code, how to determine which is the median.\n\nAlternatively, find the indices where the values are such that the selected pivot is the median.\n\nSo, the median will be the one that is not the smallest or largest.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2\n\na = arr[low]\nb = arr[mid]\nc = arr[high]\n\nWe compare all three values and find the one that is the median.\n\nBut in code, you can write it as:\n\nif a < b < c: # or some condition like that?\nWait, perhaps a function that returns the index of the median.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nCompare the three values, and decide which one is the second.\n\nAnother approach is to create a list of tuples containing the value and their index, then sort them and select the middle one.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's a good approach.\n\nSo:\n\ndef _select_pivot(arr, low, high):\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    candidates = [\n        (arr[low], low),\n        (arr[mid], mid),\n        (arr[high], high)\n    ]\n    # sort the candidates by their values\n    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # the median is the second one after sorting\n    median = sorted_candidates[1]\n    # return the index of the median\n    return median[1]\n\nWait, but suppose two of the three are the same value. Then the sorted_candidates will have duplicates, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThis function would select the middle value of the three, which is the median.\n\nOnce the median index is found, we need to swap it to the high position. Because the Lomuto partition expects the pivot at high, so if our median is already at high, we don't swap. Else, we swap arr[high] with arr[median_index].\n\nSo, in the _quick_sort function:\n\npivot_index = _select_pivot(arr, low, high)\nif pivot_index != high:\n    arr[(high, pivot_index)] = arr[(pivot_index, high)]  # swap\n\nWait, but in Python, you can swap with a tuple assignment: arr[high], arr[pivot_index] = arr[pivot_index], arr[high].\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\npivot_index = _select_pivot(arr, low, high)\nif pivot_index != high:\n    arr[pivot_index], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivot_index]\n\nWait, no: because after selecting the median, we need to bring it to the high index. So whatever the index is (low, mid, or high), we swap it with high.\n\nBut if high is the index of the median, nothing is done.\n\nOnce the pivot is at high, we can perform the partition.\n\nSo in the main _quick_sort function after swapping, the pivot is at high. So call the _partition function.\n\nImplementing the _partition function according to the Lomuto method.\n\nHere's how the Lomuto partition works:\n\n- Initialize two indices, i and j. i is set to low - 1, j starts at low.\n- The pivot is at high, which is arr[high].\n- Iterate j from low to high:\n   - if arr[j] <= pivot:\n      - i is incremented by 1.\n      - swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n- After the loop, swap the pivot (arr[high]) with arr[i+1].\n- Return i+1 as the new pivot index.\n\nThe _partition function takes low and high, with arr[high] as the pivot, and returns the new index of the pivot.\n\nWait, let's code _partition:\n\ndef _partition(arr, low, high):\n    pivot = arr[high]\n    i = low - 1\n    j = low\n    while j <= high:\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            i += 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        j += 1\n    # After loop, swap pivot to i+1\n    return i + 1\n\nWait, wait\u2014does this work?\n\nNo, not exactly. Because when j reaches high, which is the pivot itself. So after the j loop, which includes high, the if condition is evaluated for the pivot, which is equal to itself. i is incremented again, but that might cause the i+1 to go beyond high.\n\nWait, perhaps that's why in standard Lomuto, j runs up to high-1. Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet me check the Lomuto algorithm on Wikipedia. On the English page, the pseudocode is:\n\nfunction lomuto_partition(A, low, high) is\n    pivot := A[high]\n    i := low \n    j := high\n    while i \u2264 j do\n        if A[i] \u2264 pivot then\n            i := i + 1\n        if A[j] \u2265 pivot then\n            j := j - 1\n        if i \u2264 j then \n            swap A[i], A[j]\n    swap A[i], A[j]\n    return j\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Or maybe I'm mixing different versions.\n\nWait, no, perhaps that's another way to implement in-place partitioning. So in this approach, i starts at low, j starts at high. We move i forward until A[i] > pivot, and move j backward until A[j] < pivot. Then swap them if i \u2264 j.\n\nWait, this may differ, but perhaps the result is same: the pivot is placed in a position such that all elements before are <= pivot, and all after are >= pivot.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach I was thinking of was incorrect.\n\nSo let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the correct Lomuto partition function is as follows:\n\nIn the initial code I wrote, the i and j start at low-1 and low, respectively. For each j from low to high, if arr[j] <= pivot, increment i, swap i and j.\n\nAfter all j, swap with high.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me find the standard Lomuto partition in Python.\n\nUpon checking, Lomuto's partition is sometimes written as:\n\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n    pivot = arr[high]\n    i = low - 1\n    for j in range(low, high + 1):\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            i += 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    # After processing, i+1 is the pivot's final position\n    return i + 1\n\nWait, this makes more sense.\n\nIn this code, i is initialized to low-1. Then, for each j from low to high:\n\nIf arr[j] <= pivot: increment i, swap with j.\n\nWait, so for the high element (pivot), which is j == high, it's processed.\n\nIf it's <= pivot (which it is), then i is incremented, and arr[j] swaps with arr[i].\n\nBut after j reaches high, we'll do one last swap.\n\nFor example, initial i is low-1.\n\nLet me take a sample array.\n\nSample array:\n\n[5, 3, 8, 6, 2, 4, 1], high is 6 (element 4 is at high? Or wait, maybe the code is 1-based?)\n\nWait, not sure. Let me assume it's 0-based.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nArray: [5,3,8,6,2,4,7], high is 6 (element 7). Low is 0.\n\nThe pivot is 7.\n\ni starts at -1.\n\nj runs from 0 to 6.\n\nj=0: arr[0] =5 <=7 --> i becomes 0. swap 5 with 5 (no change).\n\nj=1: arr[1] =3 <=7: i=1, swap 3 and 3: no change.\n\nj=2: arr[2] =8, which is >7: no swap. i remains 1.\n\nj=3: 6 <=7: i=2. Swap j=3 (6) with i=2 (8). Now, array becomes [5,3,6,8,2,4,7].\n\nj=4: 2 <=7: i=3. Swap 8 (arr[3]) and 2 (arr[4]). Array becomes [5,3,6,2,8,4,7].\n\nj=5: 4 <=7: i=4. Swap 8 and 4: array [5,3,6,2,4,8,7].\n\nj=6: 7 is <=7: i=5. Swap 8 and 7. Array becomes [5,3,6,2,4,7,8].\n\nThen return i+1=6, which is correct.\n\nSo the function seems to return the correct position.\n\nSo this version of Lomuto's function works as intended.\n\nThus, perhaps I should implement this approach.\n\nSo, in the helper function _partition(arr, low, high), the j runs from low to high, inclusive. For each j, if arr[j] <= pivot, i is incremented and swapped with j.\n\nOnce the loop is done, I return i+1.\n\nSo, in the _quick_sort function:\n\n- Call _partition with current low and high (with pivot at high).\n- Get the pivot_pos.\n- Then, call _quick_sort for low to pivot_pos-1, and pivot_pos+1 to high.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the _quick_sort function:\n\ndef _quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    if low >= high:\n        return\n    # select pivot using median-of-three\n    pivot_index = _select_pivot(arr, low, high)\n    # bring pivot to high\n    if pivot_index != high:\n        arr[pivot_index], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivot_index]\n    # partition the array\n    pivot_pos = _partition(arr, low, high)\n    # recursively sort the left and right partitions\n    _quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_pos - 1)\n    _quick_sort(arr, pivot_pos + 1, high)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the _select_pivot function is as I wrote before:\n\ndef _select_pivot(arr, low, high):\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    candidates = [(arr[low], low), (arr[mid], mid), (arr[high], high)]\n    # sort candidates by value, pick the middle (median)\n    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    median_value, median_index = sorted_candidates[1]\n    return median_index\n\nBut wait, perhaps this can be implemented more efficiently. But given the time constraints and the problem's performance requirements, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test with an example.\n\nSample Input:\narr = [10,5,2,3,7,6,8,4,9,1]\nExpected Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\nWait, but this is just to see if the code works.\n\nWait, let me simulate the first step.\n\nInitial call: _quick_sort(arr, 0, 9). Low=0, high=9.\n\nIn _quick_sort: select pivot as median of the first, middle, and last elements.\n\nFirst element is arr[0]=10, middle is (0+9)//2 =4, arr[4]=7, last is arr[9]=1.\n\nSo the candidates are (10,0), (7,4), (1,9). Sorted by value: 1,7,10. The median is 7. So the median index is 4. So pivot is 7, which is at index 4.\n\nBut wait, the code will swap it with high (index9) only if it's not already high.\n\nIs 4 equal to high? No. So after swapping, arr[4], arr[9] = arr[9], arr[4].\n\nSo the array becomes:\n\nAfter swap, arr[4] is 1, arr[9] is 7.\n\nWait wait, arr is [10,5,2,3,1,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nWait no:\n\nInitially, arr is [10,5,2,3,7,6,8,4,9,1].\n\nAfter swapping indexes 4 and 9:\n\n- arr[4] becomes 1\n- arr[9] becomes7.\n\nSo new array:\n\n[10,5,2,3,1,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nNow, call _partition with low=0, high=9.\n\nPivot is arr[high] =7.\n\ni is initialized to -1.\n\nj runs from 0 to 9:\n\nj=0: arr[0]=10 >7: do nothing.\nj=1:5<=7: i +=1 (0), swap 5 and 10: array becomes 5,10,2,3,1,6,8,4,9,7.\n\nj=2:2 <=7: i=1, swap 2 and3: ? Wait, wait j=2 is 2 <=7. So i is incremented to 0 and 1.\n\nWait, let's re-trace:\n\nAfter j=1: array is [5,10,2,3,1,6,8,4,9,7], i=0 because initial i is -1, j=0: 10>7, so no swap, j increments to 1.\n\nWait, initial i = -1, j runs 0 to 9:\n\nj=0, arr[j]=10>7 \u2192 i remains -1. j increments.\n\nj=1, arr[j]=5\u21925<=7. i becomes 0. swap arr[0] and arr[1]. Now arr is [5,10,2,3,1,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nj=2: arr[j]=2 <=7 \u2192 i becomes 1. swap arr[1] and arr[2] \u2192 [5,2,10,3,1,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nj=3:3 <=7 \u2192i=2. swap 3 and 10\u2192 [5,2,3,10,1,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nj=4:1 <=7 \u2192i=3. swap 1 and10 \u2192 [5,2,3,1,10,6,8,4,9,7].\n\nj=5:6 <=7 \u2192i=4. swap 10 and6 \u2192 [5,2,3,1,6,10,8,4,9,7].\n\nj=6:8>7 \u2192 no swap. j=6 done.\n\nj=7:4 <=7 \u2192i=5. swap with6 and4 \u2192 [5,2,3,1,4,10,8,6,9,7].\n\nj=8:9>7 \u2192 no swap.\n\nj=9:7==7 \u2192i=6 after j increments. So i becomes 6. Swap arr[6] and arr[9] \u2192 [5,2,3,1,4,10,7,6,9,8].\n\nWait, no: after j=9, arr[j]=7, which is \u22647. So i becomes 6, swap with j=9.\n\nAfter swap, arr[6] is 7, arr[9] is 8.\n\nSo the array becomes:\n\n[5,2,3,1,4,10,7,6,9,8]. \n\nNow, after j=9, i is 6, j is 10 (out of loop).\n\nThe function _partition will return i +1\u21927.\n\nWait, but in the partition function, j runs up to high=9.\n\nWait, my code was written as:\n\nfor j in range(low, high+1):\n\nso j goes from 0 to 9, inclusive. So in this case, the code was correct.\n\nWait, and with that, after the loop, the function returns i+1=6+1=7.\n\nSo the pivot is moved to index7.\n\nSo after the pivot is placed, the array is:\n\nAt position 7:10? Because the original arr[high] was7.\n\nWait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, the initial pivot in high was7, and in the loop, the code would have swapped it to i=6, so arr[6] becomes7.\n\nAfter the loop, the function returns i+1=7?\n\nWait no: because j runs until high+1? No, high is index9, j runs up to 9 in the function.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting how the j loop works.\n\nWait, regardless, the _partition function in this example returns 7 as the pivot position.\n\nSo in the _quick_sort function, _quick_sort is called on 0 to pivot_pos-1=7-1=6, and pivot_pos+1=8 to 9.\n\nSo, first call _quick_sort(arr,0,6). The subarray is from 0 to6.\n\nWe can recursively process it.\n\nFor the left partition:\n\nIn _quick_sort(arr,0,6):\n\nlow=0, high=6.\n\nmid=(0+6)//2=3.\n\ncandidates are arr[0]=5, arr[3]=1, arr[6]=7.\n\nSo the candidates are:\n\narr[0] =5, index0.\n\narr[3]=1, index3.\n\narr[6]=7, index6.\n\nSo sorted_candidates would be [(1,3), (5,0), (7,6)]. So the median is 5, at index0.\n\nSo pivot index is 0.\n\nNow, since pivot index != high (which is6: arr[6] is7?), pivot is4\u2192wait no.\n\nWait, the current subarray is [5,2,3,1,4,10,7] \u2014 no, wait initial array after the first _partition is [5,2,3,1,4,10,7,6,9,8]. The subarray is from 0 to6: [5,2,3,1,4,10,7], high is6.\n\nmid is 3. So the candidates are index0 (5), index3 (1), and index6 (7).\n\nSo the values are 5, 1,7. Sorted is [1,5,7]. The median is 5, at index0.\n\nSo pivot is5, at index0.\n\nSo swap with high (6), so after swap, element0 becomes7, element6 becomes5.\n\nSo the subarray becomes:\n\n[7,2,3,1,4,10,5].\n\nThen, call _partition on this range, with pivot at6 (element5).\n\nSo _partition(arr,0,6):\n\ni starts at-1. j runs from0 to6.\n\npivot=5.\n\nFor each j:\n\nj=0:7>5 \u2192 no swap.\n\nj=1:2<=5 \u2192i becomes0, swap j=1 (2) with i=0 (7). Now array becomes [2,7,3,1,4,10,5].\n\nj=2:3 <=5 \u2192i=1, swap 3 and7 \u2192 [2,3,7,1,4,10,5].\n\nj=3:1 <=5 \u2192i=2, swap7 \u2192 [2,3,1,7,4,10,5].\n\nj=4:4 <=5 \u2192i=3, swap7 \u2192 [2,3,1,4,7,10,5].\n\nj=5:10>5: no swap.\n\nj=6:5 ==5 \u2192i is4, swap 7 and5: Why wait, no:\n\nWait, j=6: when j=6, the element is5.\n\nIn the _partition function:\n\nif arr[j] <= pivot (5): yes.\n\nSo i is incremented to 4, and then swap arr[j=6] with arr[i=4].\n\nSo after swap:\n\nAt j=6: arr[j] was5 and arr[i] was7 \u2192 after swap, they become7 and5.\n\nSo the array becomes [2,3,1,4,5,10,7].\n\nNow, finish the loop, return i+1 =4+1=5.\n\nSo the pivot is placed at index5.\n\nThen, in _quick_sort, the left is 0-4 and right is6-6.\n\nWait, this seems correct. So the process continues, selecting pivots and partitioning the array.\n\nBut because it's getting complex to track manually, it's better to rely on the code to handle it.\n\nRegarding in-place handling, the code should handle it because all operations are swaps within the array.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n1. Empty array: the function won't recurse, as low=0 and high=-1, but the _quick_sort function's initial check is if low>=high, which is 0>=-1 \u2192 false, but inside _quick_sort, the base case is checked, so it returns.\n\nWait, wait. The main function calls _quick_sort(0, len(arr)-1). If arr is empty, len(arr)-1 is -1.\n\nIn _quick_sort, it checks if low >= high.\n\nSo when low is 0 and high is -1, 0>=-1 is True, so return without doing anything. Correct.\n\n2. Single-element array: same as above. Low=0, high=0.\n\n3. Nearly sorted arrays:\n\nThe median-of-three will help to select a good pivot, preventing worst-case O(n^2) time.\n\nFor example, if the array is already sorted in increasing order, the median-of-three would select the correct pivot, probably the middle element, leading to a divide into two halves, avoiding worst-case.\n\nTesting with an already sorted array:\n\narr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\nThe median will select, for the first call, the middle element (see low=0, high=9) mid is (0+9)/2=4, so element 5 (at index4 since zero-based, the middle is 5 in zero-based, with three elements 1,5,10) \u2014 the median is5, which is at index4. So swapping to high.\n\nAfter swapping, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,10,6,7,8,9,5].\n\nWait no: I think the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. After selecting the median of three elements (10 is high=9?), no.\n\nWait, low=0, high=9. mid is 4. So the three elements are arr[0]=1, arr[4]=5, arr[9]=10.\n\nSo sorted are 1,5,10. Median is5 at index4. So swap with high which is9. So arr becomes after swapping: [1,2,3,4,10,6,7,8,9,5].\n\nThen, _partition is called with 0 as low and high=9. Pivot is5 (at high=9, initial value as the code). Wait, in this case, the partition will arrange the array so all elements <=5 are on the left, then the 5 is placed at the end.\n\nWait, maybe not\u2014because in the initial setup, the array is [1,2,3,4,10,6,7,8,9,5]. We\u2019re performing a _partition with high=9 (element5). Wait in this case, all elements except the high are <=5? No.\n\nIn any case, the _partition should correctly divide the array.\n\nNow, but this helps in realigning the array, even if it was nearly sorted, leading to better performance.\n\nThus, the in-place quick sort with median-of-three should pass the test cases and handle edge cases correctly.\n\nBut wait, wait, what about when all elements are equal? Like [5,5,5,5,5]. The median-of-three will select 5, and the partitioning will not change the array. Then, the recursion should correctly process it without any issues.\n\nWhat about for [5,1], the median is the middle. Wait, when low=0, high=1. mid=0. So the three elements are arr[0]=5, arr[0]=5, arr[1]=1. So the values are [5,5,1]. Hmm, sorted as 1,5,5. So the median is5 at index0. So it's swapped with high (index1). But the array is [5,1] \u2192 swap index0 and 1, it becomes [1,5]. Then, _partition is called on 0,1. Pivot is5.\n\nSo during the _partition, i starts at -1.\n\nj runs from 0 to1:\n\nj=0:1<=5 \u2192i increases to0. swap 0 and0: array stays.\n\nj=1:5<=5 \u2192i increases to1. swap j=1 with i=1 \u2192 no change. After the loop, _partition returns i+1=2. So the pivot is placed correctly.\n\nNow, the left partition is 0\u21921-1=0, so _quick_sort is called again on 0,0 (no action). The right partition is 2\u21921 (no action).\n\nSo the array is sorted correctly.\n\nThus, the code should handle all edge cases.\n\nIn terms of performance, using the median-of-three and in-place partitioning, the algorithm should avoid worst-case O(n\u00b2) and have average time of O(n log n).\n\nThus, the final code would be:\n\nImplement the functions as described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement an in-place quick sort algorithm that efficiently sorts a list of integers. The implementation should handle edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and nearly sorted lists. Additionally, we aim to enhance the pivot selection strategy to avoid worst-case performance, ensuring the algorithm runs efficiently on average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Quick Sort Overview**: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n2. **In-Place Sorting**: The goal is to modify the given list directly without using additional space for new lists, ensuring the sorting is done in-place.\n3. **Pivot Selection**: To avoid worst-case performance, we use the \"median-of-three\" pivot selection strategy. This involves selecting the median value from the first, middle, and last elements of the current segment of the array.\n4. **Lomuto Partition**: This partition scheme is efficient and helps in correctly placing the pivot element in its final position, which facilitates the recursive sorting of sub-arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr: list) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the given list arr in-place using the quick sort algorithm.\n\n    :param arr: A list of integers to be sorted.\n    \"\"\"\n    _quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n\n\ndef _quick_sort(arr, low, high):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to recursively sort the array in-place.\n    \"\"\"\n    if low >= high:\n        return  # Base case: nothing to sort\n\n    # Select pivot using median-of-three method\n    pivot_index = _select_pivot(arr, low, high)\n    # Swap the pivot element to the high position\n    if pivot_index != high:\n        arr[pivot_index], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivot_index]\n    \n    # Partition the array around the pivot\n    pivot_pos = _partition(arr, low, high)\n    \n    # Recursively sort the subarrays\n    _quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_pos - 1)\n    _quick_sort(arr, pivot_pos + 1, high)\n\n\ndef _select_pivot(arr, low, high):\n    \"\"\"\n    Selects the pivot as the median of the three elements at indices low, mid, and high.\n    \"\"\"\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    candidates = [(arr[low], low), (arr[mid], mid), (arr[high], high)]\n    # Sort the candidates based on their values and select the median\n    sorted_candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    return sorted_candidates[1][1]\n\n\ndef _partition(arr, low, high):\n    \"\"\"\n    Partitions the array using the Lomuto scheme, with the pivot at arr[high].\n    Returns the final position of the pivot.\n    \"\"\"\n    pivot = arr[high]\n    i = low - 1  # Index for smaller element\n    for j in range(low, high + 1):\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            i += 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    # The pivot's final position is i + 1\n    return i + 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **quick_sort_in_place Function**: This is the main function that initializes the sorting process by calling the helper function `_quick_sort` with the entire range of the array.\n2. **_quick_sort Function**: This function recursively sorts the array by first selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and then recursively sorting the sub-arrays.\n3. **_select_pivot Function**: This function selects the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the current segment to use as the pivot, which helps in avoiding worst-case performance.\n4. **_partition Function**: This function uses the Lomuto partition scheme to rearrange the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are moved to the left, and the pivot is placed in its correct position.\n\nThis approach ensures that the quick sort algorithm runs efficiently on average, with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), while also handling edge cases and nearly sorted lists effectively.",
