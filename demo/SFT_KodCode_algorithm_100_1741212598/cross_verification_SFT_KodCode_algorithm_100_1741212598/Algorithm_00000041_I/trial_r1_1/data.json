  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to implement an in-place quick sort algorithm for a list of integers. The task also requires handling edge cases and improving the pivot selection strategy. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the standard quick sort algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach. We select a pivot, partition the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot, and then recursively sort the partitions.\n\nBut the given code isn't in-place. Oh right, because the existing code probably makes copies of the array. To make it in-place, I need to modify the array without creating new lists each time.\n\nIn-place quick sort typically uses a helper function that sorts a subarray from index low to high. So I'll probably create a helper function, something like quick_sort_helper(arr, low, high), which recursively sorts the array in place.\n\nEdge cases: empty list or single-element list should do nothing. For such cases, the function should immediately return. Also, for nearly sorted lists, which could cause worst-case performance if the pivot selection is poor.\n\nWhat's the pivot selection? The user note says to use the median-of-three. Oh right, that's to avoid worst-case O(n^2) time. So, to choose a better pivot, I can take the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the current subarray. That should gives a more balanced partitioning.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Implement the helper function that handles in-place sorting.\n2. Include base case for when high - low is less than or equal to 1. Wait, if the length is 1 or 0, we return right away.\n3. For selecting the pivot, pick the median of three elements: first, middle, and last.\n   - For example, for current subarray, compute mid = (low + high)/2 as index.\n   - Compare arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high], and choose the median value as the pivot.\n   - Or maybe pick any of the three in a specific order? I think selecting the median as the pivot can help reduce the chance of worst-case behavior.\n4. Partition the array into elements <= pivot and > pivot. But since it's in-place, I need to use an efficient partitioning method without creating copies.\n\nHow does in-place partitioning work? Let's think about the standard approach.\n\nIn the standard in-place partition scheme (like Hoare partition), we maintain a left and right pointer. Elements are moved such that those less than the pivot are on the left, and greater on the right.\n\nAlternatively, the Lomuto partition is a bit simpler and might be easier to implement.\n\nHmm, which one is better? Let me recall.\n\nIn Lomuto partition, the process is:\n\nInitialize i = low - 1, j = high.\n\nThe pivot is, say, at high. Then, j starts from high, and elements are compared to the pivot.\n\nLomuto steps:\n\n- For each element arr[j], if it's less than or equal to pivot, increment i and swap arr[i] and arr[j]. Then decrement j.\n- This continues until i crosses j.\n\nThis method is known to be slightly faster and simpler to code correctly.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, since I'm choosing the pivot as the median of three, maybe I should ensure that after selecting the pivot, I place it in a position that makes partitioning efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the median of three can be particularly effective because it reduces the chance that the pivot is the smallest or largest element each time, which can degenerate the algorithm's performance.\n\nSo, putting this together, the steps for the helper function are:\n\nIf the subarray has 1 or 0 elements, return.\n\nOtherwise:\n\n1. Select the pivot using the median of the three method.\n   For example, for indices low, high, compute mid = (low + high) // 2.\n   Then, compare arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high], and choose the median as the pivot value.\n   Also, maybe swap the median element to a specific position, like the high or middle, to make the partitioning easier.\n\nWait, I think in the standard Lomuto partition, the pivot is the last element. So, perhaps after selecting the median, I should swap it with the high index before calling the partitioning.\n\nYes, that's probably the way. So, choose the median, then swap it with the high element so that during the partitioning, it's set as the pivot.\n\nWait, but how does that affect the median selection? Let me think.\n\nFor the current subarray low to high, we have three candidates: low, mid, high.\n\nWe choose the median of the three, then swap it to position high. Then, the partitioning will use that as the pivot.\n\nWait, but the median could be any of the three elements. So, perhaps after selecting the median, we swap it into position high. Then proceed to partition around it.\n\nSo, let's outline that in code:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2\n\na = arr[low]\nb = arr[mid]\nc = arr[high]\n\nif a <= b <= c:\n    median = b\nelif a <= c <= b:\n    median = c\nelif b <= a <= c:\n    median = a\nelif b <= c <= a:\n    median = c\nelif c <= a <= b:\n    median = a\nelif c <= b <= a:\n    median = b\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compare the three and determine which is the median.\n\nOnce the median is determined, we swap the median element to the high position.\n\nWait, perhaps easier way is to take the index of the median and swap it with arr[high], so that during partitioning, that element is treated as the pivot.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute mid = (low + high) // 2\n\ntake the three elements: arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]\n\nfind the median value among them.\n\nthen, find the index of that median in the current subarray, and swap it with the high index.\n\nAlternatively, just have the helper function manage the selection.\n\nHmm, okay, perhaps doing something like this:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2\n\nif arr[low] > arr[mid]:\n    swap arr[low] and arr[mid]\nif arr[mid] > arr[high]:\n    swap arr[mid] and arr[high]\nif arr[low] > arr[mid]:\n    swap arr[low] and arr[mid]\n\nThis is a common median of three approach. After this, arr[mid] will be the median of the three elements.\n\nSo, this ensures that the low, mid, high elements are in such a way that after these swaps, arr[mid] is the median.\n\nSo, then, I can process with arr[mid] as the pivot.\n\nOnce the pivot is selected, I can swap it to the high position, so that when we do the partitioning, the pivot is at high.\n\nWait, in that case, perhaps the code would be something like:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2\nselect the median of the three elements at low, mid, high.\nswap that to position high.\n\nThen, the pivot is at high, and the rest is the same as standard Lomuto.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient to not worry about where the pivot is as long as we choose the right partitioning.\n\nWell, let's proceed.\n\nOnce the pivot is chosen, I'll perform the partitioning.\n\nUsing Lomuto:\n\ni = low - 1\n\nj = low\n\nwhile j < high:\n    if arr[j] <= pivot:\n        i += 1\n        swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n    j += 1\n\nThen, we swap the pivot (which is at high) with i+1 in the end. That gives the correct position for the pivot.\n\nSo, after swapping, the pivot is in its sorted position.\n\nThen, recursively call the function on the left and right subarrays.\n\nSo, putting this together, the helper function would proceed accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the function signature is quick_sort_in_place and it's supposed to modify the array. So the helper function will be defined inside the main function.\n\nAnother point: handling the base cases. So, inside the helper function, if high <= low +1, perhaps? Wait, high, low are indices where, for example, when high - low <=1, it's considered a base case.\n\nWait, when high == low, the length is 1; when high is low+1, the length is 2.\n\nSo, if the subarray has only one or zero elements, it's already sorted.\n\nWait, but for the case where high is low+1, perhaps the helper function is unnecessary\u2014wait, the helper function would handle those elements in the partitioning. Hmm, but in the base case, perhaps anything with size less than 2 can be returned early.\n\nNow, what about for sizes 2 and above\u2014since the median of three would need a different approach when the array is of size 1, but since it's a subarray, the low and high indices will always be within the array.\n\nWait, in any case, even if the subarray has exactly 3 elements, the median of three will choose the middle one as the pivot.\n\nPutting this all together, let's outline the steps.\n\nInside the main function:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr):\n    if arr is None or len(arr) <= 1:\n        return\n    helper(arr, 0, len(arr)-1)\n\nWhere helper is a nested function.\n\nHelper function:\n\ndef helper(arr, low, high):\n    if low >= high:\n        return  # base case: 0 or 1 elements\n    # select pivot using median of three\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n    # swap to get the median to mid\n    if arr[low] > arr[mid]:\n        swap arr[low] and arr[mid]\n    if arr[mid] > arr[high]:\n        swap arr[mid] and arr[high]\n    if arr[low] > arr[mid]:\n        swap arr[low] and arr[mid]\n    # median is now at arr[mid]\n    # make it the pivot by swapping it to high?\n    # Wait, original code in helper may vary. Or maybe after this, mid is the median.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the median's value and then proceed.\n\n    # So, the pivot is arr[mid], but let's swap it with the high position so that it's at the end.\n\n    # swap arr[mid] and arr[high]\n\n    # Then, perform the Lomuto partition.\n\n    pivot = arr[mid]\n    arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n\n    # now, proceed with Lomuto.\n\n    i = low - 1\n    for j in range(low, high):\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            i += 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    # after loop, i+1 is the position to place the pivot\n    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]\n    pivot_index = i+1\n\n    # recursively sort the subarrays\n    helper(arr, low, pivot_index -1)\n    helper(arr, pivot_index +1, high)\n\nWait, no\u2014because the helper function already process from low to high, and in the partitioning, we placed the pivot in its correct position. Therefore, the left partition is up to pivot_index-1, right from pivot_index+1.\n\nThis should correctly sort the array in place.\n\nBut wait, where did I get the pivot? Because I swapped arr[mid] with arr[high], making the pivot at high. Then, when I partition from low to high-1, as in the for loop.\n\nHmm, I think this needs to be correct.\n\nTesting this logic on a small example, say [3,1,2]. low is 0, high is 2. mid is 1. So checking the initial if conditions:\n\narr[low] =3, arr[mid]=2.\n\n3>2: swap low and mid \u2192 arr becomes [2,3,1]. Then, check if arr[mid] (3) > arr[high] (1): yes, swap mid and high \u2192 arr becomes [2,1,3]. Now, check if arr[low]>arr[mid]: 2>1: yes, swap \u2192 arr is [1,2,3].\n\nSo, the median is 2, but after all the swaps, arr becomes [1,2,3]. Wait, no\u2014 that's not correct for the median of the original trio. But perhaps in this case, the initial method leads to correct placement.\n\nWait, the median of 3,2,1 is 2. After all the swaps, we end up with 1,2,3.\n\nThen, the median is 2 in position mid=1. Then, swap mid and high. So arr becomes 1,3,2.\n\nThen, proceed with partition.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps the initial method for selecting the median isn't the best. Alternatively, maybe an alternative approach to find the median index and then swap it to high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the median value, then find the index of that value and swap it to the high position.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial method overcomplicates, and perhaps it's better to compute the three values and select the median without all the swapping.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps, in code, the following steps are better for selecting the median:\n\nCompute the mid index: mid = (low + high) // 2\n\nCompare the values at low, mid, high:\n\nTake the three as x = arr[low], y= arr[mid], z= arr[high]\n\nFind the median value, which is the second smallest of x, y, z.\n\nThen, determine whether that median is at low, mid, or high, and swap it with the high position to use as pivot.\n\nSo, for example, if z is the median, then the high is already there.\n\nIf y is the median, swap mid and high.\n\nIf x is the median, swap low and high.\n\nThen, the pivot is now at high, and proceed.\n\nHmm, how to code this. Perhaps:\n\nif (x <= y and x <= z) and (y >=x and y <=z) \u2192 no, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the median value as the second smallest in the list [x, y, z].\n\nSo:\n\nmedian_val = sorted([x,y,z])[1]\n\nThen, find which index (low, mid, high) had the median_val and swap it with high.\n\nSo:\n\nif arr[low] == median_val:\n    swap low and high\nelif arr[mid] == median_val:\n    swap mid and high\nelse:\n    # arr[high] is the median_val, no swap needed\n\nThis seems more straightforward.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2\nx = arr[low]\ny = arr[mid]\nz = arr[high]\nmedian_val = sorted([x, y, z])[1]\nif arr[low] == median_val:\n    arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]\nelif arr[mid] == median_val:\n    arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n\nThis places the median_val at high position as the pivot.\n\nThat seems better. So, now the pivot is at the high position.\n\nThen, perform the Lomuto partition.\n\nNow, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, helper function gets:\n\nx = arr[low]\n\ny = arr[mid]\n\nz = arr[high]\n\ncompute median_val as the second element in sorted([x,y,z])\n\nswap the element with value median_val to high.\n\nThen, proceed to partition around that pivot.\n\nThen, place the pivot in its correct spot, and recursively sort the left and right.\n\nThis seems better because sometimes, the median of three might not be captured in the initial approach of swapping low, mid, and high.\n\nSo, now, coding this.\n\nWait, but what if there are duplicates? For example, the three values could be 5,5,5. Then, median_val is 5, and any can be swapped. So the code should handle that.\n\nYes, in code, it would find which index contains the median_val, which is 5 in any of them, and swap.\n\nAnother example: [10,5,2,3,7,6,8,4,9,1]\n\nWe need to see if the code properly handles it.\n\nBut regardless, in code it would process each subarray correctly.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nhelper(arr, low, high):\n\nif low >= high:\n    return\nmid = (low + high) // 2\nx, y, z = arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]\nmedian_val = sorted([x,y,z])[1]\nif arr[low] == median_val:\n    arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]\nelif arr[mid] == median_val:\n    arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n# else, the pivot is already at high.\n\npivot = arr[high]\n\ni = low -1\nfor j in range(low, high):\n    if arr[j] <= pivot:\n        i +=1\n        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n# after the loop, swap arr[i+1] and arr[high], which is the pivot.\n\narr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]\n\npivot_idx = i+1\nhelper(arr, low, pivot_idx-1)\nhelper(arr, pivot_idx+1, high)\n\nOkay, this seems solid.\n\nTesting it with an example.\n\nTest case 1: arr = [3,6,2,4]\n\nInitial call: helper(arr, 0,3).\n\nCompute mid = 1.\n\nx=3, y=6, z=4.\n\nmedian_val is 4.\n\narr[high]=4 matches the median_val \u2192 no swap needed. pivot is 4.\n\nThen, i = -1 (low-1= -1)\n\nfor j in 0,1,2 (since j <3):\n\nWait, for j=0, arr[j]=3 <=4: i becomes 0, swap arr[0] and j=0 \u2192 no change. Then j=1: arr[j]=6>4: no change. j increments. j=2: arr[j]=2 <=4: i becomes1, swap arr[1] and j=2 \u2192 arr becomes [3,2,6,4]. Now j=3 is the limit because j goes up to high-1 (since range is low=0 to high=3 (the range is 0,1,2,3?), wait, no: range in Python is up to high-1.\n\nWait, in the code, the for loop is:\n\nfor j in range(low, high):\n\nSo if low is 0, high is 3: j will take 0,1,2.\n\nSo in the example, j runs 0,1,2.\n\nAt j=0: 3<=4? 3 is in the first position. i becomes 0, swap elements 0 and 0: no change.\n\nj increments to 1: 6 <=4? No, so j becomes 2.\n\nj=2: 2 <=4: yes. i becomes1. Swap arr[1] and arr[2]. The array becomes [3,2,6,4].\n\nThen, j loops end.\n\nThen, swap i+1 (2) and high (3) \u2192 swap arr[2] and arr[3] \u2192 array becomes [3,2,4,6].\n\npivot_idx is 2.\n\nRecursively call helper(0,1) and helper(3,3).\n\nHelper(0,1):\n\nmid is 0.\n\nx=3, y=3 (since (0+1)//2=0), z=2.\n\nWait no, wait arr is [3], but wait in this case, it's for the subarray indices 0 to 1.\n\nWait no, the array after processing the initial step is [3,2,4,6]. So, in helper(0,1):\n\nmid = (0+1) // 2 = 0.\n\nx = arr[0] =3, y = arr[0]=3 (because mid is 0, same as low), z=arr[1]=2.\n\nThe median of 3,3,2 is 3.\n\nSo, median_val is 3.\n\nSince arr[low] is 3, swap with high=1:\n\nSo, the array becomes [2,3,4,6].\n\nPivot is 3, which is at position high=1.\n\nThen, partition:\n\ni = -1.\n\nj ranges from 0 to 0 (low=0, high=1 \u2192 j runs from 0 to 0).\n\nAt j=0: arr[j]=2 <= pivot=3.\n\ni +=1 (becomes 0).\n\nSwap arr[0] and j=0 \u2192 no change.\n\nLoop ends.\n\ni+1 =1. So, swap arr[1] (3) with arr[1] (pivot is at high=1) \u2192 no change.\n\npivot_idx=1.\n\nRecursively call helper(0, 0) and helper(2,1), but 2>1, so the latter returns.\n\nNext, perhaps I should run through this in code.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck testing all possibilities, but perhaps the code is correct.\n\nSo, in the helper function, after each partition, the subarrays are handled.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n1. Empty list: handled, as len(arr) <=1, does nothing.\n\n2. Single-element list: same.\n\n3. Already sorted list: but with the median-of-three pivot selection, the algorithm should avoid worst-case scenarios.\n\nBut in the case of a nearly sorted list, is this approach better? Yes, because choosing a median as the pivot reduces the chance of partitioning into a very small and large section.\n\nTesting with a nearly sorted list.\n\nFor example, [1,2,3,4,5] and the median-of-three for low=0, high=4, mid=2.\n\nx=1, y=3, z=5, median is 3. So, pivot is at 2, swapped to high (4). So the arr becomes [1,2,5,4,3]. Wait, no\u2014well, initial step is choosing the median of three and swap it to high.\n\nWait, maybe I should think through.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the initial step (selecting the median of the first, middle, and last elements) can be replaced by a more efficient method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a random pivot each time is an alternative approach to avoid worst-case. But the note suggests to use the median of three.\n\nSo, the code as structured should handle that.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n\n- When the array cannot be modified due to the way variables are handled. But in Python, lists are mutable, so the helper function should correctly modify the original array.\n\n- Recursion stack depth: for N up to 1e5, the recursion would cause maximum recursion depth exceeded. Oh, because Python's default recursion depth isn't that high. So, for N=1e5, the recursion might hit the recursion limit (which is around 1e4). So, this is a problem.\n\nHmm, this is a serious issue. Because for a large list, the code will cause stack overflow due to recursion.\n\nThus, converting it to an iterative approach would be better, but the problem requires to implement it, and perhaps for the constraints, the given input will not reach that.\n\nWait, the problem says len(arr) can be up to 1e5. So, the maximum recursion depth could be O(log n) which for 1e5 is about 17 levels\u2014manageable. Wait no: no, in the worst case, the recursion depth is O(n).\n\nAh, no, in the worst case, if the algorithm is O(n^2), but for n=1e5, that's impossible. So, to avoid stack overflow, an iterative approach is required. But for now, in Python, the recursion may not handle a 1e5-sized array.\n\nBut wait, the function is supposed to handle O(n log n) time on average. So perhaps with the median-of-three and the in-place approach, it's possible that for len=1e5 it can manage.\n\nBut for the purposes of this task, perhaps assuming that the recursion will handle it, but that's blowing smoke.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rewrite the helper function in a way that uses a stack to simulate the recursion, iterating over the subarrays to sort.\n\nThat's probably necessary for handling large N.\n\nSo, perhaps the helper function needs to be iterative.\n\nBut the initial function signature and function outline is recursive.\n\nSo perhaps to avoid stack overflow for large arrays, the helper function should be structured iteratively.\n\nHmm, that's a new challenge. So, to think of simulating recursion with a stack.\n\nSo, the iterative approach:\n\nThe idea is to maintain a stack that holds the subarray ranges (low, high) that need to be sorted.\n\nInitially, push (0, len(arr)-1) onto the stack.\n\nWhile the stack is not empty:\n\n   pop (low, high).\n\n   if low >= high: continue.\n\n   select the pivot.\n\n   partition the array.\n\n   add the left and right subarrays (low, pivot-1) and (pivot+1, high) to the stack.\n\nThis is the general approach for iterative quick sort.\n\nSo, I'll need to adjust the helper function to use this method.\n\nBut wait, the function is supposed to be in-place; which method is used.\n\nSo, the in-place partition is done as before.\n\nSo, the code would be structured as follows:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr):\n    if len(arr) <=1:\n        return\n    stack = [ (0, len(arr)-1) ]\n    while stack:\n        low, high = stack.pop()\n        if low >= high:\n            continue\n        # select pivot and partition\n        # the same median of three logic\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        x = arr[low]\n        y = arr[mid]\n        z = arr[high]\n        median_val = sorted([x, y, z])[1]\n        if arr[low] == median_val:\n            arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]\n        elif arr[mid] == median_val:\n            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n\n        # Proceed with Lomuto partition with pivot at high\n        pivot = arr[high]\n\n        i = low -1\n        for j in range(low, high):\n            if arr[j] <= pivot:\n                i +=1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]\n        pivot_idx = i+1\n\n        # add the two subarrays to the stack\n        stack.append( (pivot_idx +1, high) )\n        stack.append( (low, pivot_idx -1) )\n\nThis should handle the iterative approach, avoiding recursion.\n\nThus, it can handle larger arrays without stack overflow.\n\nBut wait, in the stack, the order in which we add subarrays matters.\n\nIn the iterative quicksort, the order is crucial to maintain the correct order.\n\nWait, in the code above, when we pop (low, high), process, then add (pivot_idx+1, high) and (low, pivot_idx-1).\n\nWait, but in the previous example of stack, when we pop, process, then push right and then left. So when processing, the stack maintains the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, the order could be reversed.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the stack processes: in each step, when you add the right subarray and then the left subarray, popping them from the stack means that the left is processed first.\n\nBut wait, the stack is LIFO, so if you append right and then left, the next pop will get left. So the order determines whether the stack processes subarrays in a depth-first manner.\n\nNot sure if that's important, but the stack-based approach must process correctly.\n\nSo, regardless, with the iterative approach, I can avoid the stack overflow.\n\nThus, the plan is now:\n\n- Rewrite the helper function as an iterative process, to handle large n.\n\n- Use the median of three as pivot selection.\n\n- Implement the Lomuto partition.\n\nThus, the code will proceed as:\n\nRead the array.\n\nImplement the iterative approach with a stack.\n\nNow, how to write that.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the given list arr in-place using the quick sort algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return\n    stack = [ (0, len(arr)-1) ]  # Use a list as a stack, storing tuples of indices\n\n    while stack:\n        low, high = stack.pop()\n        if low >= high:\n            continue\n\n        # Select the pivot using median of three\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        x, y, z = arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]\n        median_val = sorted([x,y,z])[1]\n\n        # Swap to bring the median to arr[high]\n        if arr[low] == median_val:\n            arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]\n        elif arr[mid] == median_val:\n            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n\n        # Now, the pivot is at high; perform Lomuto partition\n        pivot = arr[high]\n\n        i = low - 1  # index to track the position where the pivot should go\n        for j in range(low, high):\n            if arr[j] <= pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n        # Place the pivot in its correct position\n        arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]\n        pivot_idx = i + 1\n\n        # Add the sub-problems to the stack\n        stack.append( (pivot_idx+1, high) )\n        stack.append( (low, pivot_idx-1) )\n\nTesting this code.\n\nTesting with the example provided.\n\narr = [10,5,2,3,7,6,8,4,9,1]\n\nAfter running:\n\nthe function is called and the stack becomes [ (0,9) ]\n\nIn the while loop:\n\nPop (0,9).\n\nCompute mid=4, x=10, y=7, z=1.\n\nsorted([10,7,1]) \u2192 [1,7,10]. median is 7.\n\nSo, arr[low] is 10, arr[mid] is 7: so we need to swap arr[mid] to high.\n\nSo, swap mid (4 and 9 where arr[4] is 7 and arr[9] is 1 \u2192 swap them. So now arr[4] is 1 and arr[9] is 7.\n\nNow, the subarray between 0 and 9 is altered.

Wait, wait wait: x=5, y=3, z=4. So sorted is [3,4,5], median_val is4 \u2192 which is at arr[high], since in our processing, we swapped already.\n\nSo, in this case, we do not swap.\n\nThen, pivot is4 at high=5.\n\nProceeding to partition.\n\ni=low-1= -1.\n\nj starts at 0:\n\nAll elements in indices 0-5 \u2192 [5,2,3,1,6,4]\n\nWait, no: the current subarray is arr[0..5] is 5,2,3,1,6,4.\n\nWait, after prior step, for (0,5):\n\nAfter the initial step, the pivot is swapped if necessary.

So swap arr[low] (2) with high (2). So no swap needed as arr[high] is1.\n\nWait, swapping 2 with 1: arr becomes [2,3,1,4,6,5,7,10,9,8... no, wait wait.

The solution must handle edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and nearly sorted lists while using an improved pivot selection strategy to avoid worst-case performance.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **In-Place Sorting**: The algorithm will modify the given list in place rather than creating new lists, which is efficient in terms of space complexity.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The algorithm will handle edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element, which are already sorted by definition.\n3. **Pivot Selection Strategy**: To avoid worst-case performance, we use the \"median-of-three\" pivot selection strategy. This involves selecting the median value from the first, middle, and last elements of the current subarray to be the pivot, which helps in balancing the partitioning process.\n4. **Iterative Approach**: To avoid recursion depth issues for large lists, an iterative approach using a stack is employed to simulate the recursive calls.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef quick_sort_in_place(arr: list) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the given list arr in-place using the quick sort algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return\n\n    stack = [(0, len(arr) - 1)]\n\n    while stack:\n        low, high = stack.pop()\n        if low >= high:\n            continue\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        x, y, z = arr[low], arr[mid], arr[high]\n        median_val = sorted([x, y, z])[1]\n\n        if arr[low] == median_val:\n            arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]\n        elif arr[mid] == median_val:\n            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]\n\n        pivot = arr[high]\n\n        i = low - 1\n        for j in range(low, high):\n            if arr[j] <= pivot:\n                i += 1\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\n        arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n        pivot_idx = i + 1\n\n        stack.append((pivot_idx + 1, high))\n        stack.append((low, pivot_idx - 1))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Median-of-Three Pivot Selection**: The pivot is selected as the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the current subarray. This helps in reducing the chances of worst-case performance by ensuring more balanced partitioning.\n2. **Lomuto Partition Scheme**: This iterative partitioning method is used to divide the array into elements less than or equal to the pivot and those greater than the pivot. This method is efficient and helps in placing the pivot in its correct sorted position.\n3. **Iterative Stack-Based Approach**: The algorithm uses a stack to keep track of subarrays that need to be sorted, avoiding the recursion depth issues that can occur with large lists.\n4. **In-Place Swapping**: Elements are swapped in place to ensure the sorting is done without using extra space, making the algorithm space-efficient.\n\nThis approach ensures that the quick sort algorithm runs efficiently on average cases, handles edge cases, and avoids worst-case performance through intelligent pivot selection and in-place partitioning.",
