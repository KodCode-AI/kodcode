  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement the activation_function in Python. It's a function that takes a numpy array and a mode string, and then applies the specified activation function. So let's think about what activation functions are commonly used.\n\nFirst, I remember there's the binary step function. That's the one where any input below zero is 0, and above or equal to zero is 1. So for each element in the vector, if it's >= 0, the output is 1; else 0.\n\nThen there's ReLU, which stands for Rectified Linear Unit. ReLU sets all negative values to 0 and leaves positive values as they are. So for each element, if it's negative, output 0; otherwise, output the same value.\n\nThe sigmoid function is another one. It maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. The formula for sigmoid is 1/(1 + exp(-x)), where exp is the exponential function. But implementing that might need the math module.\n\nAnd maybe other modes, but according to the test cases, there's also handling for an 'unknown' mode, which should raise a ValueError.\n\nBut wait, in the test code, for the 'sigmoid' case, they are using scipy's expit function. Oh, maybe for consistency, I should use that same function. So I'll have to import expit from scipy.special. Otherwise, if I compute it myself, I have to make sure it's accurate enough for the test.\n\nWait, looking at the test in test_activation_function, for the 'sigmoid' case, it's using expected = expit(vector), which is scipy's function. So if activation_function uses expit, then the results will be exactly the same.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should do that only if scipy is installed. Hmm. But the problem says nothing about that. So maybe we can use the formula 1/(1 + np.exp(-x)).\n\nWait, okay, but for a coding problem, perhaps it's safe to proceed without relying on scipy and just compute it directly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nThe function activation_function will check the 'mode' parameter.\n\nIf mode is 'binary_step', apply the binary step function: return 1 where vector >=0, else 0.\n\nIf mode is 'relu', then the output is max(0, x) for each element.\n\nIf mode is 'sigmoid', compute 1/(1 + exp(-x)), element-wise.\n\nIf mode is any other string, raise a ValueError indicating that the mode is not recognized.\n\nSo, how to implement each mode.\n\nFor binary step, we can use np.where(vector >= 0, 1, 0). Alternatively, we can create a boolean mask and cast it to integers. Because in numpy, True is 1, False is 0. So for binary step, perhaps (vector >= 0).astype(int) works. Let me test that.\n\nFor example, for vector = [-1.2, 0, 2, ...], the condition vector >=0 would be [False, True, True, True, False, True], which as int is [0,1,1,1,0,1], which matches the expected result.\n\nSo binary_step can be (vector >=0).astype(int). Let's implement that.\n\nFor ReLU, as I said, we can use np.maximum(vector, 0). Because for each element, it's max between the element and 0. For example, for -1, max(-1,0) is 0. For 0, it's 0. For 1, it's 1. For 2, 2. Etc.\n\nFor sigmoid, we can compute it as 1/(1 + np.exp(-vector)), right? So each element x is transformed as sigmoid(x) = 1/(1 + e^{-x}).\n\nBut wait, looking at the test case for 'sigmoid' in the test, they are getting a result equal to scipy's expit, which is the same as the logistic function or sigmoid. So perhaps it's better to import expit from scipy.special to match exactly. But I should make sure that the code can run in environments where scipy is not installed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use np.exp.\n\nSo, for the function, I can use:\n\nif mode == 'sigmoid':\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-vector))\n\nBut, the problem in the test uses expit, so perhaps if I implement it that way, will it be compatible with the test case?\n\nWait, let me think about the test case for 'sigmoid' mode.\n\nIn the test code, the vector is np.array([-1, 0, 1]), and the expected result is expit(vector). So if in the activation function, I compute 1/(1 + np.exp(-vector)), that should be equal to expit?\n\nWait, expit is defined as 1/(1 + exp(-x)), yes. Because expit is the same as the logistic function.\n\nSo yes, that formula will give the same result.\n\nSo, the code for each mode is clear.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe function:\n\ndef activation_function(vector: np.ndarray, mode: str) -> np.ndarray:\n\nInside the function:\n\nCheck what mode is.\n\nWait, perhaps in code:\n\nif mode == 'binary_step':\n    return (vector >= 0).astype(int)\nelif mode == 'relu':\n    return np.maximum(vector, 0)\nelif mode == 'sigmoid':\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-vector))\nelse:\n    raise ValueError(f\"Mode '{mode}' is not supported.\")\n\nBut wait, in the test case for relu, for vector [-1, 0, 1, -2, 2], the expected output is [0, 0, 1, 0, 2]. Using np.maximum(vector, 0), that's exactly the output.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting for binary_step: [ -1.2, 0, 2, 1.45, -3.7, 0.3 ] becomes [0,1,1,1,0,1], which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the error case: if mode is 'unknown', the function raises ValueError. So in the else clause, we can include a raise statement.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nNow, let me think about possible issues.\n\nWhat about data types? The function is supposed to return a numpy array, same as vector. So for binary_step, (vector >=0).astype(int) makes it an array of integers, which is compatible with the expected test case. Relu returns a float array, because vector is a float array. For example, if the input is np.array([-1.5, ...]), then the output for relu would be 0.0, which is a float.\n\nLooking at the test case for relu: the expected output for [-1, 0, 1, -2, 2] is [0, 0, 1, 0, 2], which is correct as vector is of integer type, and np.maximum on integers returns integers? Or does numpy automatically upcast? Wait, no. If vector's dtype is float, then np.maximum would return floats. So perhaps when vector is integer, when applying np.maximum, the output is integers. But regardless, in the function, vector is passed as a numpy array, which can have any dtype.\n\nWait, but the function expects vector to be a numpy array. So regardless of vector's dtype, applying the functions should return the correct type.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return a float array in cases where the activation outputs non-integer values, like the sigmoid function.\n\nIn the test cases, the output for 'sigmoid' is compared with expit, which returns floats.\n\nSo, all should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the case of the 'binary_step' function, the output is an array of 0s and 1s, which is as expected.\n\nBut wait, in the first test case, vector is a float array, and the expected is an integer array. Assigning 0,1 as integers is correct. But numpy is fine with having integer dtypes.\n\nThus, the function should handle these without issues.\n\nThus, the code should be as outlined.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nImport numpy as np, but wait, in the provided function, the import is not there yet. Oh wait, in the function, the vector is given as a numpy array, but the code needs to import numpy to use it.\n\nTherefore, at the top, we need:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nSo, the function will have the code.\n\nThus, the complete code is as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a function that applies different activation functions to a given numpy array based on a specified mode. The function should handle three types of activation functions: binary step, ReLU, and sigmoid, and raise an error for any unrecognized mode.\n\n### Approach\nThe function `activation_function` takes a numpy array and a mode string as inputs and returns the transformed numpy array after applying the specified activation function. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Binary Step Activation**: This function maps all elements of the array to 0 if they are negative and to 1 if they are zero or positive. This is implemented using a boolean mask that is then cast to integers.\n\n2. **ReLU Activation**: This function sets all negative elements to 0 while leaving non-negative elements unchanged. This is achieved using numpy's `maximum` function to take the higher value between each element and 0.\n\n3. **Sigmoid Activation**: This function maps each element using the logistic function, which is implemented as \\( \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\) where \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If the mode string does not match any of the recognized activation functions, the function raises a ValueError.\n\n### Solution Code\nHere is the implementation of the activation function and the corresponding test cases:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef activation_function(vector: np.ndarray, mode: str) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the specified activation function to each element of the vector.\n\n    Args:\n        vector: A numpy array of input values.\n        mode: A string specifying the activation function to apply.\n            - 'binary_step': Outputs 1 for values >= 0 and 0 otherwise.\n            - 'relu': Outputs max(0, x) for each element x.\n            - 'sigmoid': Applies the sigmoid function to each element.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array of the results after applying the activation function.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the mode is not one of the supported activation functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    if mode == 'binary_step':\n        return (vector >= 0).astype(int)\n    elif mode == 'relu':\n        return np.maximum(vector, 0)\n    elif mode == 'sigmoid':\n        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-vector))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Mode '{mode}' is not supported.\")\n\ndef test_activation_function():\n    vector = np.array([-1.2, 0, 2, 1.45, -3.7, 0.3])\n    expected = np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1])\n    result = activation_function(vector, 'binary_step')\n    assert np.array_equal(result, expected)\n\n    vector = np.array([-1, 0, 1, -2, 2])\n    expected = np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, 2])\n    result = activation_function(vector, 'relu')\n    assert np.array_equal(result, expected)\n\n    vector = np.array([-1, 0, 1])\n    expected = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-vector))  # Using manual sigmoid implementation\n    result = activation_function(vector, 'sigmoid')\n    assert np.allclose(result, expected, rtol=1e-4, atol=1e-8)\n\n    try:\n        activation_function(np.array([-1, 0, 1]), 'unknown')\n    except ValueError:\n        pass  # Test passes if it raises the expected ValueError\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_activation_function()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `activation_function` is designed to be flexible and efficient. It checks the mode parameter and applies the corresponding activation function to each element of the input vector. The binary step and ReLU functions are implemented using efficient numpy operations, while the sigmoid function uses numpy's exponential function for accurate computations. The test function validates the correctness of each activation function with specific test cases, ensuring the solution is robust and handles edge cases appropriately.",
