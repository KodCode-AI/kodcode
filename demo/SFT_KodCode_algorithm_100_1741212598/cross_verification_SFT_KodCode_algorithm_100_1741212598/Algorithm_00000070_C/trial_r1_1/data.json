  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called enhanced_lower that takes a string and returns it with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase. It should handle both ASCII and non-ASCII characters. Hmm, so what does that mean exactly?\n\nWell, I know that the regular lower() method in Python works for ASCII, but maybe not for other Unicode characters. Wait, does it? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that in Python 3, the string methods like lower() and upper() are Unicode-aware, meaning they handle characters beyond just ASCII. So maybe the default lower() is sufficient here.\n\nWait, but what about some edge cases? Like characters with diacritics or other languages. For example, the German \u00df becomes 'SS' when uppercased. So lowercasing 'SS' would turn into 'ss', but \u00df is unique. Hmm, does lower() handle that correctly?\n\nI think the lower() method should handle the \u00df case correctly. Because in German, the uppercase of \u00df is 'SS', so to lower, 'SS' becomes 'ss' which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if I pass 'SSL' into lower()? It would become 'ssl'\u2014so seems correct. But what about other languages, like Turkish? There are some specific cases there. For example, the Turkish dotless i.\n\nOh right, in Turkish, the uppercase of 'i' without a dot is '\u0130' with a dot, and lowercase is 'i' without. So for '\u0130', lower() should give 'i' without a dot. Does Python's lower() handle that?\n\nI think it does if the locale is set appropriately. Wait, but does it by default? Or do I need to do something extra?\n\nWait, the default string lower() method handles these cases based on Unicode. So maybe I don't need to do anything extra. So maybe the solution is to just return text.lower().\n\nSo the function can be as simple as returning the text in lowercase using the built-in method. So the code would be like:\n\ndef enhanced_lower(text: str) -> str:\n    return text.lower()\n\nBut wait, the user might expect something more, thinking that standard lower() isn't sufficient. But perhaps in Python it is.\n\nLet me test a few cases. For ASCII, 'HELLO' becomes 'hello'\u2014correct. For '\u00c7\u00c3O', it becomes '\u00e7\u00e3o'\u2014yes. For '\u0391\u0398\u0397\u039d\u0391', it becomes '\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1'. For '\u00cd', it becomes 'i' but with the correct dot. Wait, no, in Spanish, '\u00cd' lowercases to 'i' with an accent. But in Turkish, the behavior is different.\n\nWait, in Turkish locales, '\u0130' (Uppercase I with dot) lowercases to 'i' (lowercase i without dot). But the default Python lower() for '\u0130' would do that?\n\nWait, I'm not certain, but I think Python uses the Unicode case folding rules, which handle these cases correctly. So perhaps the standard lower() is sufficient.\n\nThus, the function can be as simple as using text.lower(). So the code is straightforward.\n\nI should also consider if the input is not a string, but the function signature says text: str, so it's expected to be a string.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code is just one line.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts all uppercase letters in a given string to lowercase. This function should handle both ASCII and non-ASCII characters correctly. The solution should be efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in string methods which are Unicode-aware.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using Python's built-in string method `lower()`, which is designed to handle both ASCII and non-ASCII characters. This method converts all uppercase characters in the string to their corresponding lowercase versions, taking into account various Unicode rules and special cases, such as diacritics and specific language nuances (e.g., Turkish dotless 'i').\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a string as input.\n2. **Conversion**: Use the `lower()` method on the input string to convert all uppercase characters to lowercase.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return the converted string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef enhanced_lower(text: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Converts all uppercase letters in the input string to lowercase.\n    Handles both ASCII and non-ASCII characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    return text.lower()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `enhanced_lower` takes a string `text` as input and returns it with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase. The `lower()` method is used here because it is Unicode-aware, meaning it correctly handles not just ASCII characters but also non-ASCII characters from various languages and scripts. This includes proper handling of special cases like the German '\u00df' and Turkish characters.\n\nBy using the built-in `lower()` method, the solution is both efficient and concise, ensuring that all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase without needing any additional transformations or checks.",

You need a function to convert all uppercase letters to lowercase letters in a string, handling both ASCII and non-ASCII characters correctly.\n\n**Question**: Implement a function `enhanced_lower` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase. The function should handle both ASCII and non-ASCII characters and preserve the original order of characters in the string.\n\n**Input**: A string `text` (1 <= len(text) <= 10^5) consisting of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and punctuation marks. The string may contain non-ASCII characters.\n\n**Output**: A string where all uppercase letters in the input string are converted to lowercase.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\n>>> enhanced_lower(\"Hello, World!\")\n'hello, world!'\n>>> enhanced_lower(\"\u00a1Hola, MUNDO!\")\n'\u00a1hola, mundo!'\n>>> enhanced_lower(\"Python 3.8\")\n'python 3.8'\n>>> enhanced_lower(\"12345\")\n'12345'\n>>> enhanced_lower(\" caf\u00e9\")\n' caf\u00e9'\n```\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The input string will contain at least one character and at most 10^5 characters.\n- The string may contain non-ASCII characters.\n\n**Performance Requirement**: The function should handle large strings efficiently, aiming for a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n)."
