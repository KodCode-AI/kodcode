  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to implement an optimized version of the integer square root function using binary search. Hmm. Let me think about what the current implementation might be doing and how I can make it more efficient.\n\nThe function signature given is def optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:. So the input is a non-negative integer, and it returns the integer square root. Oh wait, but the note says that for the test case, when the input is -1, it should raise a ValueError. So first thing, I need to handle the case where num is negative. So in the function, I'll check if num is less than 0, raise ValueError. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the requirements mention that this function should find the integer square root, which is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to num. So for example, for 15, it's 3 because 3^2 is 9 and 4^2 is 16 which is over.\n\nThe function needs to be O(log n) time and O(1) space, which binary search already provides. But the key here is to optimize the binary search to reduce the number of iterations. So I need to think about the initial bounds and also how to quickly determine if a number is a perfect square, so I can return early.\n\nLet me brainstorm about the binary search approach:\n\nBinary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. So the initial low can be 0 and high can be num. But wait, if num is a very large number, like 2^63 -1, which is the maximum for a 64-bit integer, setting high to num could be inefficient. Wait, for the integer square root, the maximum possible is not num, but more like num squared. Wait no, no, the square root of num. Wait, no. For example, if num is 100, high can be up to 10, which is sqrt(100). So for binary search, high can be initially set to the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the possible square root. Or perhaps an alternative approach is better.\n\nBut perhaps a smarter initial high can reduce the number of steps. Let's think: for num >=2, the high can be set to num//2 +1. Wait, let's see: for num 15, 15//2 is 7, plus 1 is 8, which is higher than the square root of 15 (~3.87). Hmm yeah, the square root is definitely less than num//2 for num>4. Hmm, but maybe it's even better to set high to the number of bits required. Like, the square root can't be larger than 2^(k/2), where k is the number of bits in num. For example, if num is 2^k, then the square root is 2^(k/2). So for 2^31, square root is 2^15.5 which is about 32768.\n\nAlternatively, for setting high, perhaps I can use bit manipulation. For a 64-bit number, the square root can fit in 32 bits, so perhaps I can compute the number of bits in num and set high accordingly. Oh right, in Python, integers can be of arbitrary size, but the idea remains.\n\nWait, but even without that, for most practical purposes, setting high to the minimum between num and some function of num that's closer to its square root is helpful. Alternatively, high can start at 1, and then keep doubling until mid^2 exceeds num.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a two-step approach: first find an upper bound by starting from 1 and expanding exponentially, then perform binary search within that upper bound. For example:\n\n1. If num is 0 or 1, return it.\n2. Else, find the smallest high where high^2 is >= num, starting from 1 and doubling each time. So for num = 15, this would find high=4, since 4^2 is 16>15.\n3. Once high is found, perform binary search between low = high//2 and high.\n\nThis approach can reduce the number of steps in the binary search because the initial bounds are tighter. Let's see how many steps this would take.\n\nLet me test with a small number, say 15.\n\nExponential search step:\nstart with low=1, high=1. Check if 1^2 <15: yes. So low = high, high *=2. Now high=2. 2^2=4 <15: yes. low=2, high=4.\nhigh=4: 4^2=16 >=15: exit loop. So now binary search from low=2, high=4.\n\nWait, but the loop condition in the exponential expansion needs to stop when high^2 > num. So now binary search in [low, high). Well, perhaps even better to have the loop find the correct upper bound.\n\nWait, what is the standard way to implement the binary search with initial bounds?\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach combines both. For example, when num is 0 or 1, return it directly. Otherwise, set low to 0 and high to num, but then use this exponential search to find a better high. Hmm.\n\nWait, but for num like 2^31-1 (2147483647), the initial high can be set to 1 and kept doubling until it's bigger than the square root, which is 46340 for this case. How long does that take? Each step doubles high. So 1, 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384. That's about 15 steps. But wait, 2^15 is 32768, which multiplied by 2 is 65536. Wait, 2^16 is 65536. Wait, the square of 32768 is 2^31 (approx), which is bigger than 2^31-1, which is 2147483647. So 32768 squared is 1,073,741,824, which is larger. So yes, 32768 is bigger than the square root, which is 46340 something.\n\nSo the exponential search would take about log2(46340) steps, which is about 16 steps. But binary search for log2(num) steps would be like 31 steps. Wait, wait, wait! Wait, no. Because if high is set correctly via exponential search, the subsequent binary search would take O(log(number of possible candidates in the [low, high] interval)), which is a tighter range.\n\nBut wait, for the standard binary search, when high is set to num, the number of steps is about log2(num). For num being 2^31, that's 31 steps. Whereas, with the exponential search, the initial steps are O(log (sqrt(num))) = O( (1/2) log num) steps, which is about 16 steps in this case, but that's only the setup for the exponential search. Then the binary search steps are in the order of log (high - low), which is O( (1/2) log num ) as well. So in total, it's O( (1/2) log num ) steps. Wait, no, not exactly. Because number of steps is in the same order as O(log n) but perhaps with a smaller constant. For 2^31, with high initially set to 2^16, the binary search on 2^16 numbers would take 16 steps. So the total steps with the exponential approach would be about 16 steps for exponential search and 16 steps for binary search, total ~32 steps, which is same as the standard binary search (32 steps for num=2^31). Hmm, that's not better. So perhaps that approach doesn't save steps. So maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard binary search approach with some optimizations can be more efficient.\n\nSo perhaps the initial low and high can be set more efficiently. For low, start at 0, high can be 1 initially, and while high squared is less than or equal to num, we increase high. Once high squared is larger than num, we have the upper bound, and can perform the binary search between low and high.\n\nWait, that's similar to the exponential search idea but perhaps integrated into the binary search. Let me think: for example, in the function, if num is 0 or 1, return it. Else, set low = 0, high = 1. Then, while high*high <= num, set high *=2, and low = high//2. So this quickly expands the high to a upper bound.\n\nLet me test this with num=15:\n\nInitial high=1. 1^2=1 <=15, so high becomes 2, low=0. 2^2=4 <=15 \u2192 high=4, low=2. 4^2=16 >15, exit loop. Now binary search between 2 (low) and 4 (high). The steps will be 3 and so on.\n\nWait, but wait: high squared is 4^2=16>15 \u2192 so low=2, high=4.\n\nIn the binary search:\n\nmid = (2+4)//2 =3. 3^2=9 <=15. So set low=3, then mid becomes (3+4)//2=3 again, then (3+4+1)//2=3... No, perhaps I should think about how the binary search would proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the initial steps would reduce the number of iterations in the binary search.\n\nWait, but this approach requires calculating high squared, which for very large numbers can be expensive. But in Python, number operations are efficient, but compared to the standard approach, is this better? Maybe for very large num, this reduces the number of binary steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial high can be set to the bitwise length. For example, for num in binary, there are k bits. Then sqrt(num) is roughly 2^{(k//2)}.\n\nWait, perhaps we can compute high as 1 << (k//2 +1), where k is the number of bits in num. Then, adjust accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to calculate it as follows:\n\nCompute high = 1 << (num.bit_length() // 2). For example:\n\nnum = 15 \u2192 binary is 1111 (4 bits), so 4//2=2, 1<<2=4 \u2192 so high=4.\n\nIn this example, the initial binary search is between 0 and 4. So the sample binary search will have mid = 2.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about how the standard binary search works. For num=15, low=0, high=15.\n\nWait, but in the initial setup, for a large num, high is set to num, which could be inefficient. So perhaps instead of high=num, set high to min(num, 1 << (num.bit_length() +1)), or some such.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think in terms of optimizing the binary search's bounds during execution.\n\nI think another optimization is to handle the case when the current mid is a perfect square. For example, if mid^2 == num, then we can return immediately without further searching. Because binary search will find mid, but perhaps returning earlier can save some steps.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Handle edge cases first: if num is 0 or 1, return 0 or 1, respectively.\n\n- if num is negative, raise ValueError.\n\n- For num >= 2:\n\n   Use binary search, with low as 0, high as a properly set upper bound.\n\nImplement the binary search with optimized steps:\n\n- To set high initially, use the method where it starts at 1 and doubles until mid^2 > num.\n\nBut wait, that's the exponential search method again. So first, I'll set high:\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 1\n\nWhile high^2 <= num:\n\n   low = high\n\n   high *= 2\n\nOnce this loop ends, 'high' is larger than the square root, and 'low' is the previous step.\n\nNow, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nWait, no: During the exponential expansion step, for num=15:\n\nInitially, high=1. 1^2=1<=15 \u2192 low=1, high=2.\n\nhigh=2^2=4<=15 \u2192 low=2\u2192 high=4.\n\n4^2=16>15 \u2192 exit loop.\n\nSo low is now 2, high is4.\n\nSo binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nSo the binary search steps would proceed as normal.\n\nWait, in binary search:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=4.\n\nmid=(2+4)//2=3.\n\n3^2=9<=15 \u2192 so set low=3.\n\nCheck if new low is <= high.\n\nMid again: (3+4)//2=3. 3^2 is still 9 <15. So, since 3^2 is less than num, we can try mid+1.\n\nSo if the condition is that mid^2 is less than num, we set low=mid+1.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nSo the binary search loop:\n\nInitialize low = previous low, high.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2.\n\n   mid_sq = mid * mid.\n\n   if mid_sq == num: return mid.\n\n   elif mid_sq < num: low = mid + 1.\n\n   else: high = mid -1.\n\nAt the end, after the loop, return high.\n\nWait, no: because if the loop ends, and the high is the integer part of the square root.\n\nHmm. Wait, let's test for num=15.\n\nAfter the loop, high is 3, low would have went beyond.\n\nSo the function returns high, which is 3, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for num=25.\n\nmid steps will find 5, where 5^2=25 \u2192 return mid.\n\nAnother test case: num=2 \u2192 function returns 1.\n\nSo perhaps the binary search inside the function can be implemented as follows.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Handle the num ==0 case.\n\n- Handle num <0 case: raise ValueError.\n\n- Handle num=1 case.\n\n- Else, use exponential search to find a high that is just above the square root. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nAnother thing to think about: sometimes the initial exponential expansion may take a few steps, but the binary search then runs in a smaller range, leading to fewer steps overall.\n\nAnother optimization is to compute high correctly to minimize the number of steps in binary search.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLet me structure the code:\n\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n\n    # Handle edge cases\n\n    if num < 0:\n\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n\n    if num == 0 or num ==1:\n\n        return num\n\n    # Exponential search to find the upper bound\n\n    low =1\n\n    high =1\n\n    while high * high <= num:\n\n        # Move the window\n\n        low = high\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now perform binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n\n        if mid_sq == num:\n\n            return mid\n\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n\n            # Potential answer is mid or higher.\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    # After the loop, high is the floor of sqrt(num)\n\n    return high\n\nWait wait, wait. Let's see what's the initial low and high after the exponential search.\n\nIn the case when num=15:\n\nIn the exponential loop:\n\nInitially, high =1, 1\u00b2<=15: set low to1, high to2.\n\nThen 2\u00b2=4 <=15: set low=2, high=4.\n\nCheck 4\u00b2=16>15. Exit loop. Now, binary search between 2 and4.\n\nIn the binary search steps:\n\nlow=2, high=4.\n\nmid =3, 3\u00b2=9 <15.\n\nSo low becomes 4.\n\nmid now becomes (4+4)//2=4.\n\n4\u00b2=16>15 \u2192 high becomes3.\n\nLoop ends (since low=4, high=3 \u2192 low>high).\n\nReturn high=3, correct.\n\nAnother test: num=31.\n\nSquare is about 5^2=25, 6^2=36>31.\n\nExponential:\n\nhigh=1 \u2192 1<=31 \u2192 low=1, high=2.\n\n2\u00b2=4 <=31 \u2192 low=2, high=4.\n\n4\u00b2=16 <=31 \u2192 low=4, high=8.\n\n8\u00b2=64>31\u2192 exit loop.\n\nBinary search between 4 and8.\n\nlow=4, high=8.\n\nmid=6:6\u00b2=36>31\u2192 high=5.\n\nlow=4, high=5.\n\nmid=4, 4\u00b2=16 <31: low=5.\n\nlow=5, high=5: mid=5, 5\u00b2=25 <31: low=6.\n\nNow low > high\u2192 exit. Return 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, what happens when num is a perfect square like 25?\n\nExponential search:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921\u00b2=1 <=25.\n\nlow=1, high=2.\n\nhigh\u00b2=4 <=25: low=2, high=4.\n\nhigh\u00b2=16 <=25 \u2192 low=4, high=8.\n\n8\u00b2=64>25 \u2192 exit.\n\nBinary search between 4 and8.\n\nlow=4, high=8.\n\nmid=6:6\u00b2=36>25\u2192 high=5.\n\nmid=(4+5)//2=4. 4\u00b2=16<25: low=5.\n\nmid=5:5\u00b2=25 equals num: return 5.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: num=2.\n\nExponential loop:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921\u00b2=1 <=2.\n\nlow=1, high=2.\n\nhigh\u00b2=4>2 \u2192 exit.\n\nbinary search between 1 and2.\n\nlow=1, high=2.\n\nmid=1. 1\u00b2=1<2 \u2192 low=2.\n\nmid=2: 4>2 \u2192 high=1.\n\nloop ends, return high=1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWhat about num=2_147_483_647?\n\nWhich is 2^31-1. The square root is about 46340. So 46340\u00b2= (46340)^2. Let me verify the code.\n\nThe exponential search starts with high=1.\n\nLoops until high\u00b2 <= num.\n\nLet's calculate how much high is increased.\n\nEvery step, high doubles.\n\nInitially, high=1 \u2192 check 1\u00b2 <=2e9: yes. low=1, high=2.\n\nSame for 2, high becomes4.\n\nContinue until high reaches 2^k.\n\nHow many times until high reaches 2^15 (32768)?\n\nSo after each step, the high becomes 1,2,4,8,16,...,32768. Wait, 32768 squared is (2^15)^2=2^30=1073741824. But num is 2147483647.\n\nSince 32768^2=1073741824 <= 2147483647 \u2192 yes. So high becomes 65536.\n\nCheck 65536^2: 4_294_967_296 > 2e9. So loop exits. So now low is 32768, high is65536.\n\nWait, wait, no: in the exponential step, for each iteration, low = high, and high *=2.\n\nSo after 1\u21922\u21924\u2192...\u219232768 is when high is 32768.\n\nThen, in the loop, 32768^2 <= num: yes.\n\nSo low=32768, high=32768 *2 =65536.\n\nCheck 65536^2: which is bigger than num. So loop exits.\n\nSo now, binary search between 32768 and 65536, looking for x where x\u00b2 <= num.\n\nWait, num is 2147483647.\n\nWhat is 46340^2? 46340 squared is 2_147_395_600. Which is less than 2_147_483_647. So the answer is 46340.\n\nWait, no. 46340^2 is approximately 2.1473956e9. Which is less than 2.147483647e9.\n\nSo in binary search, the mid is calculated between 32768 and 65536, but 32768 is larger than 46340.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial technique is flawed. Wait, no\u2014 wait, no, 32768 is larger than 46340? Because 46340 is around 46 thousand, whereas 32768 is 32 thousand something. Oh wait, no, 32 thousand is less than 46 thousand. So no, the high after exponential search is 65536, which is larger than 46340.\n\nSo in the binary search between low=32768 and high=65536 for mid such that mid\u00b2 is as large as possible without exceeding num.\n\nWait, in this case, I think the binary search within 32768 and65536 will take more steps.\n\nWait, for 2^31-1=2147483647:\n\nlow after exponential: 32768\n\nhigh:65536.\n\nBut the actual square root is about 46340. So in the initial high-low range, 32768 to 65536, but the correct answer is 46340.\n\nThus, the binary search would proceed as follows:\n\nInitially, low=32768, high=65536.\n\nmid = (32768 + 65536) // 2 = 49152.\n\nBut 49152 squared is (49152)^2= 241_786_429_  361? Wait, let's compute:\n\n49152 *49152:\n\nCompute 49152 *49152.\n\nHmm, 49152*49152 is 2,418,211,724,448 which is more than 2,147,483,647.\n\nThus, mid_sq is larger than num.\n\nWait, so the code would set high =49152-1=49151.\n\nNext step:\n\nlow=32768, high=49151.\n\nmid= (32768+49151)/2= (81919)/2=40959 (since (32768+49151) is 81919, integer division is 40959).\n\nCheck 40959 squared: approximate. Let's see:\n\n40959^2: 40959*40959 is about ?\n\nWell, 40960^2 is 1,677,721,280; but 40959 is 1 less, which is (x)^2 = x\u00b2 -2x+1. So 40959^2 is 1,677,721,280 - 2*40960 +1 = 1,677,721,280 -81,920 +1= 1,677,639, 361 (approximately)\u2014 wait no, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Anyway, 40959^2 is about 1.6776e9.\n\nWait, 1,677,639,361 is more than 2,147,483,647. So 40959^2= (40960 -1)^2 = 40960^2 - 2*40960 +1 = (2^32)/(4^2) ^2? Hmm anyway, 40959 squared is 1,677,639,361, which is less than 2,147,483,647.\n\nWait, no\u2014 1,677 million is less than 2,147 million. So 40959 squared is less than 2,147,483,647. So mid_sq is < num \u2192 low=40959+1=40960.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when mid_sq < num: set low=mid+1.\n\nElse, set high=mid-1.\n\nSo in this case, mid_sq < num: low becomes 40960.\n\nNow, high is 49151. So mid next is (40960 +49151) //2 =45,105 + ... Well, compute sum: 40960+49151=90011. Divide by 2 is 45,005.5 \u2192 45,005 as integer division.\n\nWait, 45,005^2 = 2,025,050,025 which is larger than 2,147,483,647? No, wait 45,005^2 is (45,000)^2 is 2,025,000,000. So 45,005 squared is (45,000+5)^2=45,000\u00b2 + 2*45,000*5 +25=2,025,000,000 +450,000 +25=2,025,450,025. Which is more than 2,147 million? Wait, no\u2014 2,025 million is 2.025e9, which is less than 2.147e9. Wait 2,025,450,025 is less than 2,147,483,647. So mid_sq is 2,025,450,025 < 2,147,483,647 \u2192 set low=mid+1=45,006.\n\nNow new low=45006, high=49151.\n\nMid is (45006 +49151)//2= (94157)//2=47078.\n\nCalculate 47078^2: 47078 *47078. Let's estimate\u2014 47078 is about 47 thousand.\n\n47,078^2 = (approx ... 47,000^2 is 2,209,000,000, which is more than 2,147 million. So 47078^2 is 47,078^2.\n\nWait 47,078^2 = ?\n\nWell, let me compute it as follows:\n\n47078^2 = (47000 +78)^2 = 47000\u00b2 + 2*47000*78 +78\u00b2.\n\n47000\u00b2 = 2,209,000,000.\n\n2*47000*78 = 2*47000=94,000 *78= 94,000*70=6,580,000; 94,000*8=752,000 \u2192 total 7,332,000. So together with 47000\u00b2: 2,209,000,000 +7,332,000= 2,216,332,000.\n\nPlus 78\u00b2=6,084. So 2,216,332,000 +6,084= 2,216,338,084. Which is 2,216,338,084 compared to num=2,147,483,647.\n\nSo mid_sq is 2,216e6 which is bigger than 2,147 million. Thus, we set high=47078-1=47077.\n\nNow, low=45006, high=47077.\n\nmid = (45006 +47077)//2 = (92083)//2=46041.5 \u219246041.\n\nCompute 46041 squared: 46041*46041.\n\nHow much is that?\n\nWell, 46000^2 is 2,116,000,000. 41^2 is 1681. The cross term is 2*46000*41= 3,772,000.\n\nSo 46041^2=2,116,000,000 + 3,772,000 +1,681= 2,119,773,681.\n\nWhich is less than 2,147,483,647. So mid_sq < num \u2192 set low=46041+1=46042.\n\nNow, low=46042, high=47077.\n\nmid= (46042+47077)//2 =830,119//2=41,505.5 \u219241,505 as integer division.\n\nmid=41,505^2 \u2192 41,505 *41,505.\n\nWait, 41,500^2= approx 1,722e+6. Wait no\u2014 wait wait, no, no\u2014 wait, the number is 41,505. That's ~41 thousand. 41 thousand squared is 1.68e9.\n\nWait no! Wait 41,505 is over 400, so the thing is, I think I made an error in comprehending the range.\n\nWait, no. Original num is 2,147,483,647, which is about 2.14e9. So any x whose x squared is less than this is acceptable.\n\nWait, in the binary search after exponential step, after several steps, the low and high were 32768 and 65536.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary search as implemented is taking too many steps because the initial high wasn't tight enough.\n\nWait, but in this particular case, can I think if setting high to 65536 is causing more steps than needed? Maybe, but the question is, can it be optimized?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the catch is to set the high after the exponential search to be something like mid_squares that don't exceed the num.\n\nBut I'm not seeing that.\n\nSo perhaps for the code, the binary search implementation is sufficient, as it's getting towards O(log n) steps, even if for some very large num, the exponential expansion takes many steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exponential expansion isn't useful here, and it's better to compute the square root via bit shifts or other tricks.\n\nAnother idea is to find a way to calculate the square root without using binary search, but perhaps with a mathematical approach.\n\nWait, but the function has to be in Python, which can handle big integers.\n\nWait, but in Python, for the math module, there's math.isqrt, which returns the integer square root. But that's available in Python 3.8+. But perhaps the code can use that, but the point is to implement it ourselves.\n\nSo, perhaps the current plan is correct, but perhaps to handle high correctly to avoid unnecessary steps.\n\nWait, in the code for the optimized function:\n\nIn the code I wrote, for the num=2147483647 (which is 2^31-1), the binary search starts with low=32768 and high=65536.\n\nWait, but 65536 is 2^16. But the square root of 2^31 is 2^15.5, which is about 32768*1.414..., which is approx 46300. So 32768 is 2^15, 65536 is 2^16.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial exponential search after the num case would take more steps than needed. So perhaps another approach is better.\n\nWait, but for the binary search, if the initial high is 2^16 and the answer is 46340, than the binary search will take log2(2^16) = 16 steps, which is the same as a standard binary search approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use initial high as 1, then expand until high squared > num, but for very large num, that would be a lot of steps.\n\nSo perhaps using a different way to compute high: let's compute it using the bit length.\n\nThe number of bits of num can be computed with num.bit_length(). So the number of bits in num is k.\n\nThen, the square root would require (k+1)//2 bits.\n\nFor example:\n\nnum=15 is 4 bits, so sqrt requires (4+1)//2=2 bits \u2192 high= 2^(2) *2= 4*2=8 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, wait for num=15, sqrt is about 3, which is 2^1.58, so heigh can be 4.\n\nWait, another approach: for the initial high, set it as 2^(floor(k/2) +1). So for even k: 2^(k/2). For odd k: 2^( (k+1)/2 ). But this needs to be tested.\n\nAlternatively, to calculate the high as min(2^((k+1)//2), num), where k is the bit length.\n\nWait, for num=15:\n\nbit_length is 4. high would be 2^(4//2+1) \u2192 is 2^(2+1) =8.\n\nHmm, but 8 squared is 64>15.\n\nSo in this case, the binary search step is from low=0\u2192high=8.\n\nWhich is more steps than he earlier approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to find a better way for initial high.\n\nWait another idea: in the binary search, initial high could be set to the binary length-based approach, but then again that may not be better.\n\nBut perhaps the current approach with the exponential search for high is sufficient.\n\nAnother optimization: during the binary search, when mid^2 is computed, but if mid is 0, 1, or 2, it's handled correctly.\n\nBut that's perhaps beyond this step.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial code is okay, but catch that there's a mistake in the initial exponential expansion function.\n\nWait, in the code above:\n\nIn the initial exponential search:\n\nlow =1\n\nhigh=1\n\nwhile high * high <=num:\n\n   low=high\n\n   high *=2\n\nSo when num is a square, for example, num=16.\n\nSo the while loop:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921\u00b2<=16: set low=1, high=2.\n\n2\u00b2=4 <=16: low=2, high=4.\n\n4\u00b2=16 <=16: set low=4, high=8.\n\nWhile condition: 8\u00b2=64>16 \u2192 exit.\n\nSo binary search between 4 (low) and8.\n\nmid=6: 36>16 \u2192 high=5.\n\nmid=4.5\u21924, 4\u00b2=16==num \u2192 returns 4.\n\nWait, no: mid would be 4 and 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the code correctly handles the square cases.\n\nAnother corners case: when num is very large and a perfect square, like num= (2^31-1)^2.\n\nBut perhaps the code finds this in one step.\n\nSo in conclusion, the approach of using an exponential search to find the upper bound and then perform binary search in that range seems correct and efficient.\n\nAnother thing to test: num=2.\n\nExponential search:\n\nhigh starts at1. 1^2=1 <=2. So low=1, high=2.\n\nThen high condition check: 2\u00b2=4>2 \u2192 exit.\n\nBinary search between 1 and2.\n\nmid=1: 1^2=1 <2\u2192low=2.\n\nNext iteration: low=2, high=2.\n\nmid=2, 2^2=4>2 \u2192 high=1.\n\nLoop ends, return high=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nAnother point: in the implementation, perhaps instead of using a while loop for the exponential search, it can be done with bit manipulation or so, but perhaps that's not necessary.\n\nBut in the current code, perhaps the initial high is not necessary to be calculated in that way. For example, perhaps for the early returns when num is 0 or1, returning them immediately.\n\nWhat about num=0: handled.\n\nWhat about num=2 (\u221a2 is ~1.414, integer square root is 1: correct.\n\nAnother edge case: num=3: same as 2.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all of that.\n\nThus, the function as per the code above seems to be correct.\n\nSo to write the function:\n\nHandle edge cases:\n\n- if num is negative, raise ValueError.\n\n- if num is 0 or 1, return num.\n\nElse:\n\n   Initialize low=1, high=1.\n\n   while high*high <=num:\n\n       low = high\n\n       high *=2.\n\n   Perform binary search between low and high.\n\n   in binary search:\n\n      while low <=high:\n\n          mid = (low+high)//2.\n\n          mid_sq= mid*mid.\n\n          if mid_sq == num \u2192 return mid.\n\n          elif mid_sq < num: low = mid +1.\n\n          else: high= mid-1.\n\n   after loop, return high.\n\nThus, the function should pass all the test cases.\n\nAnother test case: num=31.\n\nWhich returns5, per the test.\n\nAlso, when num=2_147_483_647, the square root is 46340.\n\nTesting whether the code returns that.\n\nIn the code, the binary search between 32768 and 65536, which through multiple steps, the high converges to 46340.\n\nSo the code appears correct.\n\nThus, this is the plan.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the integer square root of a non-negative integer using an optimized binary search approach. The integer square root is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number. The goal is to implement an efficient solution with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log(n))\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(1)\\).\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves two main steps: an exponential search to find the upper bound of the possible integer square root, followed by a binary search within this bound. This method ensures that we minimize the number of iterations required to converge to the solution.\n\n1. **Exponential Search**: This step is used to quickly find an upper bound for the binary search. Starting from 1, we keep doubling the value until its square exceeds the given number. This gives us a range where the integer square root is guaranteed to lie.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: Once the upper bound is established, we perform a binary search within this range. This involves repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and checking if the midpoint's square is less than, equal to, or greater than the given number. If the midpoint's square equals the number, we return the midpoint immediately. If it's less, we adjust the lower bound; if it's more, we adjust the upper bound.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n    if num < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if num == 0 or num == 1:\n        return num\n\n    low = 1\n    high = 1\n    while high * high <= num:\n        low = high\n        high *= 2\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return high\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function first checks if the input is negative, raising a `ValueError` if so. If the input is 0 or 1, it directly returns the input as these are trivial cases.\n\n2. **Exponential Search**: This step starts with `low` and `high` both set to 1. The loop continues doubling `high` until `high^2` exceeds the input number. This ensures that `high` is an upper bound for the integer square root.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: Using the bounds established by the exponential search, the function performs a binary search. The midpoint (`mid`) is calculated, and its square is compared to the input number. Depending on the comparison, the search range is adjusted either by moving the lower bound up or the upper bound down. If the midpoint's square exactly matches the input number, the midpoint is returned immediately.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values for the integer square root, ensuring minimal iterations and optimal performance for very large numbers.",
