  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a function called optimized_integer_square_root which is more efficient than the original binary search version. Hmm. Let me think about what an integer square root is. Oh right, it's the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number. So for example, for 15 it's 3 because 3^2 is 9, which is less than 15, and 4^2 is 16 which is too big.\n\nFirst, I should make sure that the function handles edge cases properly. The input must be a non-negative integer. Oh right, the function should raise a ValueError if the input is negative. So my first step is to check if num is negative, and if so, raise ValueError.\n\nWait, no. Wait, what if the input is zero? That should return zero. Oh, but in the test cases, for 0 it returns 0. So I should handle that case early.\n\nNow, looking at binary search. The standard approach is to set low and high pointers. But since square root of n is <= n, for the initial high, I could set it to n. But wait, wait. Because for n=0 or 1, the initial conditions might not be optimal. Or maybe setting high to n may not be the best choice because for numbers larger than 1, maybe a better upper bound can be found.\n\nWait, but the square of n/2 could be larger or smaller than n, depending on n. So perhaps a better approach is to set high to a smarter upper bound. Alternatively, for high, I can set it to min(num, num // 2 + 1), but that might not always hold. Hmm.\n\nWait, thinking again: The maximum possible square root for a positive integer n is n. But that can be too large for the high, leading to unnecessary iterations in the binary search. So is there a better way to limit the high?\n\nWait, for any n > 1, the square root is at most n//2. Wait, is that right? Let's think for n=2, sqrt is 1, which is 2//2=1. For n=3, yes. n=4 is 2 which is 4//2. Yeah, but for n=5, sqrt is 2, also 5//2 is ~2. So yes, for n>1, the square root is <= n//2. Except when n is exactly 2. So perhaps setting high to n//2, or something like that, could reduce the upper bound more.\n\nWait no, wait. For n=1, sqrt is 1. n//2 is 0, that would cause high to be lower than the possible maximum. Wait, but n=0 and 1 are special. So maybe I should set high differently based on the value of num.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to calculate high is that when num is 0 or 1, we can return early. So initial steps of the function could be: if num is 0 or 1, return num. Because for num=0, square root is 0, num=1 is 1. And for num between 2 and 3 (like 2,3, etc.), we can set low to 1 and high to num//2.\n\nSo perhaps before starting the binary search, we have some early returns. Like:\n\nif num < 0: raise ValueError\nelif num == 0 or num ==1:\n    return num\nelse:\n    proceed with binary search.\n\nThat will handle the edges of 0 and 1.\n\nNext, for binary search: the basic approach is to find the maximum mid such that mid^2 <= num.\n\nWait, but calculating mid^2 can sometimes cause integer overflows, but in Python that's not an issue since it handles big integers automatically. So I don't have to worry about that part.\n\nNow, in the binary search, the traditional approach is to have low and high, and in each step compute mid = (low + high)//2, then check if mid^2 is <= num.\n\nIf mid^2 is larger than num, then we need to set high to mid -1, else set low to mid.\n\nWait, but let's think for a minute: the idea is to find the largest mid where mid^2 <= num.\n\nSo perhaps in the loop, we can proceed as follows:\n\nstart with low = 0, high = num. Wait, earlier thought was that for num>1, high can be set to num//2, but perhaps for the general case, we can just set high initially to num. Because if the number is larger. Or, perhaps a better high would be sufficient to cover the possible mid.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate high correctly to have as tight a bound as possible.\n\nSo for example, for large numbers like 2^31-1, setting high to num is too big and could waste steps. So perhaps a smarter high is better.\n\nBut maybe not, because in binary search the number of steps is log2(high), so the saving in steps would be minimal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in some sources, I've seen that for searching the integer square root with binary search, the high is set to (low + high + 1)//2. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using high = num and then adjusting low and high as the search proceeds is acceptable because each step reduces the search space by half.\n\nWait, but in Python, due to the while loop condition, as long as each step halves the remaining interval, the number of iterations is O(log n), which is acceptable.\n\nSo perhaps the standard approach is acceptable in terms of time complexity, so perhaps the current implementation is already O(log n). So why optimize it?\n\nWell, perhaps the current binary search implementation doesn't handle some edge cases, or checks the bounds in a way that could be optimized.\n\nWait, another approach is to use Newton-Raphson method. That's another way to compute square roots, perhaps faster? Because the Newton-Raphson method converges quadratically. But for integers, it needs to be adapted.\n\nBut Newton-Raphson is more efficient than binary search since it can have a O(log log n) convergence. But I'm not sure if that's easier to implement correctly, especially edge cases.\n\nBut since the task is to optimize the binary search approach, perhaps I should stick with that and optimize the binary search.\n\nWait, so what is the current approach? Let me imagine the original code. Maybe it's something like:\n\ndef integer_square_root(num):\n    if num < 0:\n        raise ValueError\n    if num ==0 or num ==1:\n        return num\n    low = 0\n    high = num\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return high\n\nWait, because when the loop ends, high will be less than low, and high is the maximum where mid^2 <= num.\n\nFor example, when num is 15:\n\n- The binary search would find that 3^2 is 9 <=15, 4^2 is 16>15, so high will end up as 3.\n\nSo the code returns high.\n\nBut in this code, in some cases, maybe high could be adjusted for larger numbers to be more optimal.\n\nWait, but what about the current steps?\n\nFor example, when num is 2, the initial low and high are 0 and 2, mid is 1, mid^2=1 <=2. So low becomes 2. mid now is (2+2)/2=2, mid^2 is 4>2, so high becomes 1. Now low (2) > high (1) ends loop. Returns high=1, which is correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps the current code is correct, but maybe it can be optimized further, as per the task.\n\nThe task says to implement an optimized version. So I need to make it faster. So perhaps there are a few optimizations we can do.\n\nOptimizations:\n\n1. Pre-check: if num is a perfect square, return early.\n\nWait, but how? Because that's what the binary search is trying to find in the first place. So perhaps it's better to handle perfect squares by having an early return when mid^2 == num.\n\nBut in the current code, as soon as mid^2 == num, it returns, which is correct. So perhaps no further improvement there.\n\nWait, but another approach: Maybe compute the float square root and then take the integer part, but then verify if it's correct. Because sometimes due to floating point precision errors, this could be incorrect for very large numbers.\n\nBut in this problem, perhaps it's better to compute the integer edges with binary search.\n\nAnother optimization for the binary search is to adjust the high to a more appropriate initial value.\n\nFor example, the square root of 2^k is 2^(k/2). So perhaps for initial high, we can compute it based on exponents.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find a better high by shifting right. But for the binary search, perhaps the initial high can be set to min(num, 1 << (num.bit_length() // 2 + 1)).\n\nWait, but for example, how does that work?\n\nLet me take num= 2^30 (1,073,741,824). The square root is 32,768. The bit length is 31. So 31//2 is 15, plus 1 is 16. 1 << 16 is 65536, which is larger than the square root. So high becomes 65536, which is larger than necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps for numbers which are perfect squares, setting high to a tighter upper bound can help. But in general, the initial high could be higher than necessary, but perhaps due to the O(log n) nature, it doesn't add too many iterations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe due to the size of the while loop, the time difference is negligible.\n\nSo perhaps the initial high can be 1 << (n.bit_length() + 1) // 2, which is the upper bound and ensures that the square root is within that.\n\nWait, but for example, how much is 1 << (bit_length + 1)//2 for num = 25. 25 has 5 bits in binary. (32 in 5: 25 is 11001, which is 5 bits, right?) So (5+1)//2 is 3. 1<<3 is 8, which is the correct high.\n\nYes. 25's square root is 5, which is less than 8.\n\nSo perhaps, for 31, which is 31 in binary is 11111 (5 bits), plus 1 is 6 //2 is 3. 1<<3 is 8. So high is 8.\n\nWhich is same as initial approach.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo perhaps in code, I can set initial high to 1 << ((num.bit_length() +1)//2), which may be a better upper bound, thus potentially reducing the number of steps.\n\nWait, let's test this for a few cases.\n\nFor num= 2^31-1, which is 2147483647 (binary is 31 bits). So (31 +1)//2 is 16. 1<<16 is 65536.\n\nBut wait, the square root of 2^31 is about 46340.95, and 65536 is way higher. So that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWait wait\u2014no, sorry, the square of 46340 is 2,147,395,600 (about 2^31). Hmm, but 46340 squared is 2^31 is larger than 2^31-1.\n\nWait, 46340^2 is equal to 2,147,395,600 which is greater than 2,147,483,647? Wait no, wait 2^31 is 2,147,483,648. So 46340 squared is 2147395600. Which is less than 2,147,483,647? No, wait 2147395600 is less than 2147483647? Let's calculate:\n\n2147395600 is 2,147,395,600.\n\n2,147,483,647 is 2,147,483,647. So yes, 2,147,395,600 is less than that +48,047?\n\nWait no, because 2,147,483,647 is larger than 2,147,395,600. So 46340^2 is 2,147,395,600 which is less than 2,147,483,647. So the square root would be 46340 plus something, but since it's integer, I think the square root of 2,147,483,647 is 46340, because 46340^2 < ... <46341^2.\n\nSo 46341 squared is 46341 *46341. Let's see: 46340^2 is 2,147,395,600. 46341^2 = (46340 +1)^2 = 46340^2 + 2*46340 +1 \u2192 2147395600 + 92680 +1= 2147488281. But the original num is 2,147,483,647, which is less than 2,147,488,281. So the square root is 46340.\n\nSo, so the initial high is set to 65536.\n\nSo, the binary search will proceed from low=1 to high=65536 for number 2,147,483,647.\n\nBut wait, is 65536 the tightest upper bound? Because sqrt(2^31) is approx 46340.95, so the maximum possible sqrt is 46340.\n\nSo if high is 65536, the binary search would have to cover up to that number, maybe taking more steps than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, using 46341 as the high would only add a few steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way to set the initial high.\n\nAlternatively, for very large numbers, maybe we can compute the initial high as the minimum of num and (high calculated based on leading digits).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps calculate a better initial high.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to get that.\n\nAlternatively, thinking differently. After setting high the initial way, maybe during the binary search, the high can be adjusted early.\n\nAnother optimization is to break as soon as we know that the current value can be the answer.\n\nWait, another approach is to make the binary search start with better initial values.\n\nIn the standard binary search for square roots, the initial low and high are 0 and num. So the steps would be O(log2(num)).\n\nAs the problem requires O(log n) time, this is acceptable.\n\nSo perhaps, the main optimizations possible are:\n\n1. Early returns for 0, 1.\n2. Setting high to a better initial value.\n3. Possibly precompute for certain intervals when the square is known.\n\nBut overall, the binary search is already O(log n), so further optimizations won't change the time complexity, but can speed it up by constant factors.\n\nSo how can we improve this code?\n\nAnother optimization comes from the initial high value.\n\nWait, for example, if the number is a perfect square, then the binary search would have found it in log2(n) steps, but perhaps with some tweaking, we can find it faster.\n\nBut I don't think so\u2014it's not possible to know in advance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the built-in math.isqrt function in Python (if available) is better. But no, because I need to implement it myself.\n\nAnother idea is to use bit manipulation to reduce the number of steps.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nSo let's think about implementing the binary search.\n\nAnother possible optimization is to calculate the mid in a smarter way. Let's think:\n\nIn each step, we can calculate mid as (low + high) >> 1, but perhaps we can use some heuristics to set mid to higher or lower limits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when mid is in a certain range, we can compute the next steps in a way that covers more ground.\n\nBut maybe this complicates the code without providing tangible benefits.\n\nAlternatively, another possible optimization is to calculate the initial high by looking at the bits. For example, high can be set to 1 << (n.bit_length() // 2), which for even bit lengths is correct, and perhaps handle odd cases.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nnum = 25 \u2192 binary 11001, 5 bits.\n\nbit_length() is 5 \u2192 divided by 2 is 2 \u2192 1 << 2 is 4. High is 4, which is less than the square root (5). So that would cause the initial high to be too low, which is bad.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 4 is less than the actual square root, the binary search would not find 5 in that case.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier approach was better.\n\nSo, perhaps high should be set as the maximum of 4 (or some base) and 1 << (bit_length//2) +1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to set high to 1 while (high^2) <= num: high *=2. But that would require a loop, which is O(log n) in the worst case. So it's not saving time.\n\nWait, maybe the initial high is not that important for the final log(n) steps. As such, perhaps the initial high can be kept as min(num, some upper limit that is known).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the initial high as (num >> (num.bit_length() -1)) +1. Hmm, maybe that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of setting the high such that high^2 is just larger than num, which would create a tighter bound. But this requires mathematical calculations.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps optimizing the initial high is not the way to go.\n\nSo perhaps move on to another optimization point: handling perfect squares early.\n\nWait, but anyway, the binary search's path depends on the mid calculation. So when a perfect square is found, it's returned immediately, which is good.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be restructured to handle the perfect square case earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps compute the square of (n) and check if it's a perfect square before doing the binary search? Because for n being a perfect square, it would return early.\n\nBut how to compute the square root without binary search? Not sure. Alternatively, using math.sqrt and then checking if the result is integer.\n\nWait, but math.sqrt has floating point inaccuracies for very large numbers. For example, import math; math.sqrt(10**30) may not be exactly precise.\n\nHence, relying on math.sqrt may not be accurate.\n\nBut perhaps, for smaller numbers, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, to compute the sqrt mathematically with a different method.\n\nBut again, for very large numbers, math.sqrt could be inaccurate.\n\nSo that's not the path to take.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the main optimizations can be:\n\n1. Handle early returns for 0 and 1 quickly.\n\n2. For numbers greater than 1, start the binary search with a better initial high value, such as 1 << (num.bit_length() // 2 + 1), which is the next power of two beyond the square root.\n\nWait, let me think: for a number num, the square root is less than or equal to 2^((bit_length +1)/2). So perhaps set high to 2^ceil(bit_length /2 + 1) or something.\n\nSo for example, num=25 (bit_length 5). ceil(5/2) is 3. So 2^3=8.\n\nSo high=8, which is larger than 5, which is correct.\n\nThe bit_length for numbers: num=0 is 0. For positive numbers, it's floor(log2(num)) +1.\n\nSo for num=2^k, bit_length is k+1. So for num=16 (bit_length of 5 because 16=10000 in binary, which is 5 bits), square root is 4, which is 100 in binary (3 bits). So 5//2 is 2. So 2^(2 +1) is 8.\n\nSo perhaps the initial high can be set to (1 << ((num.bit_length() +1)//2 )).\n\nTesting that:\n\nFor num=25, which is 5 bits. (5+1)//2=3 \u2192 1<<3=8, correct.\n\nFor num=31 (11111, 5 bits \u2192 (5+1)//2=3 \u2192 8), but the square root is 5 is less than 8.\n\nFor num=15 (binary 1111, 4 bits \u2192 (4+1)//2=2 \u2192 4. High starts at 4, correct.\n\nBut for num=16, which is 5 bits, (5+1)//2=3, high=8. Which is correct.\n\nFor num= 2^30, which is 1,073,741,824 (binary is a 1 followed by 30 zeros \u2192 31 bits). So (31+1)//2=16 \u2192 1<<16=65536. Which is more than 46340 (sqrt is 46340).\n\nSo the high gets set to 65536, which is manageable.\n\nSo, in code, after checking for num <0 and early returns for 0 and 1, I can set high to the value (1 << ((num.bit_length() +1)//2)).\n\nAnd set low to 1, I think.\n\nWait, because for num 0 and 1, it's already handled.\n\nSo the steps:\n\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n    if num <0:\n        raise ValueError\n    if num ==0 or num ==1:\n        return num\n    # Set initial high\n    high = 1 << ((num.bit_length() +1) //2)\n    low = 1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return high\n\nWait, but let's test this with some test cases.\n\nTest case 1: num=15.\n\nhigh is (4 +1)//2= (binary length is 4: 15 is 1111 \u2192 4 bits, (4+1)/2=2.5, but integer division is 2. 1<<2 is 4. So high is 4. Wait, no: (4//2 is 2, plus 1?)\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute:\n\nnum=15, binary 1111 \u2192 4 bits.\n\nbit_length is 4.\n\n(4+1)/2 is 2.5, but since it's integer division in Python 3, (4+1)//2 is 2.\n\nWait, in Python, (4+1)//2 is 2.\n\nSo high initial value is 1 << 2 \u2192 4. So high is 4. But the actual square root is 3, which is less than 4.\n\nSo the binary search will start from low=1 to high=4.\n\nLoop starts:\n\nmid = (1+4)//2=2, mid_sq=4 <15. So set low=3.\n\nNow, high=4, low=3.\n\nmid= (3+4)//2 =3 \u2192 mid_sq=9 <=15 \u2192 set low=4.\n\nNow, low=4, high=4. Compute mid=4, mid_sq=16>15 \u2192 set high=3.\n\nLoop ends, since low>high.\n\nReturn high, which is 3. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the high is 4, which is more than necessary. But the algorithm still works properly.\n\nAnother test case: num=25.\n\nbit_length is 5 \u2192 (5+1)//2=3 \u2192 high is 8.\n\nmid will be (1+8)//2=4 \u2192 16 <=25 \u2192 low=5.\n\nmid is now (5+8)//2=6.5\u21926 in Python 3 integer division: 6^2=36>25 \u2192 high=5.\n\nmid is (5+5)//2=5 \u2192 25 ==25 \u2192 returns 5. Correct.\n\nWhat about num=31 (binary is 11111, 5 bits \u2192 same as above):\n\nhigh is 8. 5^2=25 <31 \u2192 low becomes 6.\n\nNext, loop continues. Let's trace:\n\nlow=5, high=8.\n\nmid=6.5\u21926. mid^2=36>31 \u2192 high=5.\n\nSo loop condition is low (5) <=high (5).\n\nmid=5, mid^2=25 <=31 \u2192 low=6, now 6>5, exit.\n\nreturn high=5 which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nAnother test case: num=0 \u2192 returns 0.\n\nnum is 1: returns 1.\n\nWhat about num=2^63 -1 (the maximum for a 64-bit integer)? Let's see what the code will do. But this might be too big to handle. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nEdge case anyway.\n\nSo due to this initial high calculation, the number of steps is still O(log n), but perhaps we can have a faster convergence.\n\nAnother optimization is to adjust the high based on whether the current mid is a perfect square. But I don't see a straightforward way.\n\nAnother possible optimization is to make sure that when the square is larger than the remaining range, the binary search could adjust the high or low accordingly. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial high may be 1 more than (1 << (num.bit_length() // 2)), because seems sometimes the high needs to be increased.\n\nWait, for example, with num=31, the square is between 5 and 6. So if the initial high is 1 << (5//2) \u2192 1<<2=4. But since 5^2 is 25 <=31, and 6^2 is 36>31. So initial high of 4 is too low.\n\nYes, this is the case. So how to prevent that? Or perhaps setting high to (1 << (bit_length //2)) and then checking if high^2 is less than num, if yes, double high until high^2 >= num.\n\nWait, perhaps this would help.\n\nThis is another idea. The algorithm is called \"exponential search\" where initially, we set high to 1 and double it until high^2 is larger than num. Once we have an initial high, we perform the binary search.\n\nBut then, how much time does it add? Because in the worst case, it could take log(high) steps. So the total time remains O(log n).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to compute high as the maximum power such that high^2 is <=num. So sets a tight upper bound.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be adjusted to first find the correct high, then do a binary search.\n\nFor example, initial high is 1. While high^2 <= num: high *=2.\n\nOnce high^2 > num, set high to high//1, and perform binary search between high//2 and high.\n\nSo let's try this.\n\nIn code:\n\nif num ==0 or num ==1:\n\n   return num.\n\nhigh =1\n\nwhile high * high <= num:\n\n   high *=2\n\nSo now, high is the smallest power of two where high^2 > num. So the initial binary search can be done between high//2 and high.\n\nFor example, num=31 \u2192 initial high becomes 32 because:\n\nhigh=1 \u2192 1^2=1 <31 \u2192 high=2.\n\nhigh=2: 4 <31 \u2192high=4.\n\nhigh=4^2=16 <31 \u2192 high=8.\n\n8^2=64>31 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nSo the binary search is done between high=8 and low=4.\n\nSo in this case, the initial range is narrow:4-8.\n\nWhich is better than the earlier approach which starts high at 8 as here.\n\nWait, but in this case, for num=31, the range after exponential search is 4-8, same as when using (bit_length +1)//2 method. So for this case, perhaps it's similar.\n\nBut for num=1e6, let me calculate:\n\nsqrt(1e6) is 1000.\n\nThe exponential approach:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921^2=1 <=1e6 \u2192 high=2.\n\n2^2=4 \u2192 high=4.\n\n... until high=1e6?\n\nWait no, no\u2014the loop condition is while (high * high <= num): high *=2 \u2192 so 1 becomes 2, but for 2^2=4 <=1e6: so 2\u21924\u21928\u219216\u2192... until 2^20 is 1,048,576. Then 1,048,576^2 is 1e12, which is larger than 1e6. So the loop would make high=32768 (since 1e6 is 10^6, and high would go from 2^19=524,288: 524,288^2 is 274,877,906,944 which is way larger than 1e6. Wait no, wait 524,288 is 2^19=524,288.\n\nWait high starts at 1, and doubles each time:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921<=1e6 \u2192 yes, set to 2.\n\nhigh=2 \u21924 <=1e6 \u2192 yes \u2192 SET to4.\n\nhigh=4 \u219216 <=1e6 \u2192 yes \u21928.\n\n...\n\nhigh=512 \u2192512^2=262144 <1e6: high becomes 1024.\n\nhigh=1024^2=1048576>1e6? No, wait 1e6 is 1,000,000 \u2192 1024^2=1,048,576>1e6. So loop ends when high=1024.\n\nSo binary search is between high//2=512 and 1024.\n\nWhich is correct since sqrt(1e6) is 1000, which is between 512 and 1024.\n\nSo the binary search is efficient.\n\nSo perhaps incorporating exponential search to set high could result in better initial bounds.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nThe modified code would be:\n\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n    if num < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"num must be non-negative\")\n    if num == 0 or num ==1:\n        return num\n    # Exponential search to find upper bound\n    high =1\n    while high * high <= num:\n        high *=2\n    # Now high^2 > num, and high is the upper bound\n    # Binary search between high//2 and high\n    low = high //2\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid +1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return high # after loop, high < low, return high which is the floor.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the earlier examples.\n\nTest case 1: num=15 \u2192 high starts at 1, doubles until 4^2=16>15. So low=2, high=4.\n\nmid =3 \u21929 <=15 \u2192 low=4.\n\nlow=4 and high=4.\n\nmid=4 \u219216>15 \u2192 high=3.\n\nNow low > high \u2192 exit, return 3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case: num=2,147,483,647.\n\nWe expect the square root to be 46340.\n\nSo in the exponential search:\n\nhigh=1 \u21921^2=1 < num \u21922.\n\n2 \u21924 <num \u21924 \u219216 \u2192... and so on.\n\nWe can compute until high^2 exceeds 2,147,483,647.\n\nWhat is high after exponential search?\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nStart with 1.\n\n1, 2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, ..., etc.\n\nCompute high until high^2 > 2,147,483,647.\n\nCompute sqrt(2,147,483,647) = 46340.950... so high must reach 65536 as:\n\n46340^2=2,147,395,600 < 2,147,483,647, 46341^2 is larger. So high=46341 would be greater than 46340, but during the exponential search, what steps would happen?\n\nWait, wait. Let me trace for num=2.147e9:\n\nhigh starts at 1.\n\nMultiply by 2 each time: 1,2,4,8,16,32,... until high^2 > num.\n\nLet me calculate when high^2 exceeds 2e9:\n\n46340^2 is 2,147,395,600 <2,147,483,647.\n\n46341^2 =?\n\nWell, 46341 *46341 = (46340+1)^2 = 46340^2 + 2*46340 +1 \u2192 2,147,395,600 + 92,680 + 1= 2,147,488,281.\n\nWhich is larger than 2,147,483,647, so high becomes 46341.\n\nBut when does high double.\n\nWait, perhaps high doubles to 65536 in the exponential search\u2014so high is 65536.\n\nThen, low becomes 32768.\n\nSo the binary search starts from 32768 to 65536.\n\nBut the correct answer is 46340, so the binary search must find this.\n\nThis would require about log2(65536/32768) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo the function would proceed correctly.\n\nThis approach seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, How does the code handle the test case where num is a perfect square. For example, num=25.\n\nIn the exponential search, high doubles until it's 32 (since 5^2 is 25, 6^2=36>25). So high is 32, low is 16.\n\nThen, binary search between 16 and 32 finds 25 and returns it.\n\nSo correct.\n\nWhat about num=2: exponential search starts with high=1. 1^2 <=2 \u2192 high=2. High^2=4>2. So low=1, high=2.\n\nbinary search: mid=1.5 floored to 1. mid_sq=1 <2. So low=2. Now, mid=2, 2^2=4>2. high=1. loop ends, return high=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: num=5.\n\nExpected sqrt is 2.\n\nexponential search: high=1 \u2192 high=2 \u21924>5? No, 4<5 \u2192high=2*2=4.\n\n4^2=16>5 \u2192 loop ends, low=2, high=4.\n\nBinary search in low 2, high 4: mid=3, 9>5 \u2192 high=2.\n\nmid=2, 4<=5 \u2192 low=3.\n\nloop ends, high=2 which is correct.\n\nThis seems to handle all edge cases.\n\nSo would this code be faster than the initial approach?\n\nIn terms of the number of binary search steps, the exponential search may add a few steps to find the initial high, but the binary search between a tighter low and high could save steps overall.\n\nSo perhaps this approach is better because the initial high is more tightly bounded, which reduces the number of steps in the binary search.\n\nAdditionally, this approach works for all cases correctly, including very large numbers.\n\nSo incorporating the exponential search into the function is an optimization that improves performance.\n\nAnother point: in the code, the 'high' is 1. So, in the exponential search:\n\nwhile high * high <= num: high *=2.\n\nBut for num=0 or 1, which are handled earlier, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo now, writing the code.\n\nNow, handling the ValueError when num is negative.\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n    if num < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"num must be non-negative\")\n    if num == 0 or num == 1:\n        return num\n    # Find an upper bound using exponential search\n    high = 1\n    while high * high <= num:\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search between high//2 and high\n    low = high // 2\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return high\n\nTesting this code.\n\nWait, in the test cases, when num=31.\n\nAfter exponential search, high=32 (since 5^2=25<=31 \u2192 high=6 in steps: 1,2,4,8 \u2192 8^2=64>31. So high=8, thus low=4.\n\nThen binary search between 4 and8:\n\nLoop steps:\n\nlow=4, high=8 \u2192 mid=6 \u219236>31 \u2192high=5.\n\nNow low=4, high=5 \u2192 mid=4 \u219216 <31 \u2192 low=5.\n\nNow, low=5, high=5 \u2192 mid=5 \u219225<=31 \u2192low=6.\n\nhigh=5>low=6: loop ends.\n\nReturn high=5. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: what if num=465^2=?\n\nWell, 465^2= 216225.\n\nThe code should return 465.\n\nIn the exponential search, high starts at 1.\n\nhigh=1^2 <= 216225 \u2192 2 \u21924 \u2264 \u21928\u219216\u219232\u219264\u2192... and so on, until high=512: 512^2=262144>216225.\n\nSo low=256.\n\nBinary search between 256 and 512.\n\nOnce it finds 465, it returns.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work perfectly.\n\nAnother consideration: for very large numbers, the exponential search may take more steps. For example, for a number like (2^30)^2=2^60.\n\nIn the exponential search, it has to double high from 1 to 2^30, which would take 30 steps. And then perform a binary search, adding up to another 30 steps. So the total is 60 steps, which is manageable, and better than the initial high= (bit_length +1//2 may yield a tight bound but similar in steps.\n\nThus, the function is correct and optimized.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer using an optimized binary search approach. The integer square root is the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number. The solution must handle edge cases properly and optimize the binary search to reduce the number of iterations.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach used here is a combination of exponential search and binary search to efficiently find the integer square root. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: Directly handle cases where the input number is 0 or 1, as their integer square roots are the numbers themselves. For negative numbers, raise a ValueError.\n\n2. **Exponential Search**: This step is used to find an upper bound for the binary search. We start with a small value and double it until its square exceeds the given number. This ensures that our search space is minimized, reducing the number of iterations needed in the subsequent binary search.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: Using the bounds identified by the exponential search, perform a binary search to find the exact integer square root. This involves checking the square of the midpoint of the current range and adjusting the bounds accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef optimized_integer_square_root(num: int) -> int:\n    if num < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"num must be non-negative\")\n    if num == 0 or num == 1:\n        return num\n    # Exponential search to find an upper bound\n    high = 1\n    while high * high <= num:\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search within the found bounds\n    low = high // 2\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        mid_sq = mid * mid\n        if mid_sq == num:\n            return mid\n        elif mid_sq < num:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return high\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function first checks if the input number is negative, raising a ValueError if true. If the number is 0 or 1, it directly returns the number as these are special cases.\n\n2. **Exponential Search**: Starting with `high = 1`, we double `high` until `high * high` exceeds the input number. This step efficiently narrows down the upper bound, ensuring that the subsequent binary search operates within a minimal range.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed within the bounds found by the exponential search. For each midpoint, we check if its square is equal to the input number (returning it immediately if true). If the square is less than the input number, we adjust the lower bound; otherwise, we adjust the upper bound. This continues until the bounds converge, and the highest mid value that meets the condition is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function operates efficiently with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log(n))\\) and uses constant space, \\(O(1)\\).",
