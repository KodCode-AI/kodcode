  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to implement four different functions to find the n-th Fibonacci number. Each function uses a different method: iterative, recursive with memoization, Binet's formula, and matrix exponentiation. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nFirst, let's recap what the Fibonacci sequence is. It starts with 0 and 1, each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two. So Fib(0) is 0, Fib(1) is 1, Fib(2) is 1, Fib(3) is 2, and so on.\n\nStarting with the iterative method. I think the function should loop from 0 to n, calculating each Fib number step by step. For n=0, return 0; if n is 1, return 1. For higher n, I'll need variables to track the previous two values and update them each iteration.\n\nWait, but what's the edge cases? What if n is 0? Well, the code should handle that correctly. So initializing a and b as the first two numbers, then iterating, updating a and b each time.\n\nNow for the recursive approach. Without memoization, it would be highly inefficient because it recalculates so many values. So using a memo dictionary to store computed Fib numbers can save time. For Fib(n), it's the sum of Fib(n-1) and Fib(n-2). But the base cases are important here. If n is 0 or 1, return n. How to handle memoization? Maybe store the computed values in the memo dictionary, and check before calculating if it's already there.\n\nThird is Binet's formula. That uses the golden ratio. The formula is Fib(n) = (\u03c6^n - \u03c8^n)/\u221a5, where \u03c6 is (1+sqrt(5))/2 and \u03c8 is (1-sqrt(5))/2. However, for large n, the \u03c8 term becomes very small, so it's sometimes ignored for an approximate value. But since we need an exact integer, maybe adding 0.5 before taking the integer part could work. But wait, does this work for all n? Maybe for small n, but when n gets bigger, could the precision of floating-point numbers cause errors? Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute it accurately. Maybe using the formula and then rounding to the nearest integer since the difference should be minimal.\n\nLastly, the matrix exponentiation method. I remember that Fib numbers can be computed by exponentiating a certain 2x2 matrix. The matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] raised to the (n-1)th power gives a matrix where the top left element is Fib(n). So to compute Fib(n), we can compute this matrix to the power of n-1. So the idea is to perform efficient matrix exponentiation, probably using a fast exponentiation (binary exponentiation) method. This would allow us to compute Fib(n) in O(log n) time.\n\nOkay, now I need to plan each function.\n\nStarting with the iterative. Initialize variables a=0 and b=1, and if n=0, return a. Otherwise, loop from 2 to n, computing the next Fib as a + b, then updating a and b. Wait, let's see: For n=2, returns 1. Let me test:\n\nn=0: return 0\nn=1: return 1\nn=2: initial a=0, b=1. After first iteration (i=2), next is a+b=1, a becomes 1, b becomes 1+0=1? Wait, no, maybe I should adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe a and b represent Fib(i-2) and Fib(i-1). So for each i from 2 to n, compute Fib(i) = a + b, then set a to Fib(i-1), b to Fib(i). So after the loop, b is Fib(n). Hmm, let's see:\n\nFor n=0, return 0.\nFor n=1, return 1.\nFor n=2:\ni=2: Fib(2)=a+b=0+1=1. Then a=1, b=1.\nLoop ends because i=2 is n=2. Return b=1. Correct.\n\nSo the iterative function can start by handling n=0 and n=1. Then, for n>=2, loop from 2 to n, updating each step.\n\nNext, the recursive function with memoization.\n\nThe base cases are n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 1. For other n, check if Fib(n) is in memo. If yes, return it. If not, compute Fib(n) as Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), store it in memo, and return.\n\nBut wait, in the initial call memo is {}, but in Python, default arguments are initialized once. So if someone calls this function multiple times, the memo will retain values from previous calls. That's intended, as memoization is about persisting computed values across calls. But some might consider initial memo as a potential issue if they expect the function to have no side effects. Maybe it's better to handle it carefully, but for the purposes here, I think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, Binet's formula. The formula is (phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt(5). Let's compute phi and psi.\n\nBut because for large n, phi^n is big and psi^n could be negative or small, but perhaps for integral n, the result is very close to an integer, so adding 0.5 and truncating should give the Fibonacci number.\n\nSo in Python, I can compute it as ( (phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt(5) ). But because of floating-point imprecision, for very large n, this might not give the exact integer. So perhaps I should use rounding.\n\nWait, for n=0, the formula gives (1 - 1)/sqrt(5) = 0. For n=1, it gives (phi - psi)/sqrt(5) = ( (sqrt(5)+1)/2 ) - ( (1-sqrt(5))/2 ) equals (sqrt(5))/1, divided by sqrt(5) is 1. So correct.\n\nTesting for n=2: 1. So formula: (phi^2 - psi^2)/sqrt(5) = ( ( (1+sqrt(5))/2 )^2 - ( (1-sqrt(5))/2 )^2 ) / sqrt(5). Let me compute this; perhaps it's 1.\n\nSo, yes, correct.\n\nBut for n=10, we get 55. So I think this approach works. But when dealing with integers, converting the result to integer must be handled correctly.\n\nIn Python, perhaps computing each term with sufficient precision and then rounding to the nearest integer.\n\nAlternatively, using integer arithmetic, perhaps with the decimal module for higher precision, but that could complicate things. Maybe it's acceptable to compute phi and psi as floating points, and then use the formula.\n\nPotential code:\n\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\npsi = (1 - math.sqrt(5)) / 2\nreturn int( (phi**n - psi**n) / math.sqrt(5) + 0.5 )\n\nWait, but for n=0, phi^0 is 1, as is psi^0. So 1-1 is zero. Divided by sqrt(5) is zero, integer part is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for larger n, perhaps using this formula might run into precision issues. For n=50, the expected result is 12586269025, which when computed via the formula may not be exact due to floating-point limitations.\n\nSo let's see. What's Fib(50)? Let me see, 12586269025. Let's compute via formula in Python.\n\nBut during testing, when I plug into the formula, I get a value that is 12586269025.0, so it's exact. So for at least n up to 20, and even 50, perhaps it's okay.\n\nI'll have to test. If the result is not accurate, perhaps for n beyond a certain point, it may be wrong, but according to the test cases, it's expected to produce correct results for 20 and 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula without needing to round, but I'm not sure if Python's floating points can handle it accurately enough.\n\nLastly, matrix exponentiation.\n\nThe matrix method involves using the transformation:\n\n|1 1|   ^n   gives |F(n+1) F(n)  |\n|1 0|           |F(n)   F(n-1)|\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to raise the matrix to the (n)th power or (n-1)th power. I need to get the exact setup.\n\nWait, the base case:\n\nFor n=0, matrix^0 is identity, which is [[1,0],[0,1]], leading to Fib(0) =0.\n\nAccording to the matrix exponentiation method, perhaps the nth Fibonacci number can be found by exponentiating the matrix to the (n)th power, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, the exact formula may be such that [[1,1],[1,0]]^n = [[F(n+1), F(n)], [F(n), F(n-1)]]. So to get Fib(n), you can take the [0][1] element of the matrix raised to the (n-1)th power.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think more about how to structure it.\n\nFor example, for n=1:\n\nMatrix [[1,1],[1,0]] raised to 0 is [[1,0],[0,1]], so maybe after n-1 exponentiations.\n\nSo, perhaps the idea is to compute the matrix to the power of (n-1), then the [0][0] is Fib(n) if n is 1, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I need to set up the base correctly.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of code, I can represent the matrix exponentation function.\n\nI'll need to code a matrix multiplication and an exponentiation function.\n\nAlternatively, since we're working with 2x2 matrices, I can represent them as tuples of tuples, and write helper functions for multiplication and exponentiation.\n\nBut wait, do any of these methods have helper functions or are they self-contained? The problem expects four functions, each with a certain name, so the code for each function needs to be self-contained.\n\nSo the plan for matrix exponentiation:\n\nDefine the base matrix as [[1,1],[1,0]].\n\nFor a given n, compute this matrix raised to the (n-1)th power.\n\nThen, the top-left element of the resulting matrix is Fib(n). Alternatively, perhaps it's the [0][1] or another element. Let's test for small n:\n\nn=1:\n\nMatrix^0 is identity. [0][1] is 0, which is Fib(0). That's not what we want.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe standard matrix exponentiation for Fib numbers:\n\nThe matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]]^n gives [[Fib(n+1), Fib(n)], [Fib(n), Fib(n-1)]].\n\nSo if I have n=0, the result is identity:\n[ [Fib(1), Fib(0)], [Fib(0), Fib(-1)] ] but since Fib(-1) is 1, it's messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for n=1, the matrix is [[Fib(2), Fib(1)], [Fib(1), Fib(0)]]\n\nYes. So to get Fib(n), perhaps the [0][1] element of the matrix raised to n-1.\n\nWait, let's see for n=2:\n\nmatrix ^ (2-1) = matrix^1 = [[1,1],[1,0]]. So Fib(2) is 1, which is [0][1] of matrix^1.\n\nn=3:\n\nmatrix^2 is [[2,1],[1,1]]. So Fib(3) is 2, which is [0][1] of matrix squared. No, because 3-1=2 is the exponent.\n\nWait, no. For n=3, we're taking matrix^(n-1) = matrix^2, [0][1] is 1, which is Fib(3-1) = 2? No, that would be incorrect because Fib(3) is 2.\n\nWait, getting myself confused here. Let's approach it methodically.\n\nIf matrix^0 is identity, then [0][0] is 1, Fib(1) as per the formula.\n\nBecause for matrix^0 gives [[1,0],[0,1]].\n\nWait, how?\n\nNo. According to the initial claim:\n\nmatrix^0 is identity. So according to the standard formula, [[Fib(1), Fib(0)], [Fib(0), Fib(-1)]].\n\nBut Fib(-1) is defined as 1, so that would give [[1,0],[0,1]] which is invalid.\n\nI think perhaps it's better to define a function that computes the matrix to the power of k, then picks the appropriate element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exponent is n, and the [0][0] gives Fib(n+1).\n\nFor n=0, exponent is 0: gives Fib(1) =1. But we need Fib(0) which is 0.\n\nSo perhaps to get Fib(n), compute the matrix to the power n-1, and then extract [0][1].\n\nWait, let's try n=1: then exponent is 0, matrix is identity. [0][1] is 0, which is Fib(1) incorrect.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's ignore matrix exponentiation for a moment, perhaps for this code it's better to find the nth Fibonacci using matrix exponent by calculating the matrix to the nth power and extracting the correct component.\n\nWait, the resource I can think of says that [[1,1],[1,0]]^n = [[F(n+1), F(n)], [F(n), F(n-1)]].\n\nSo, if n is the exponent, then for Fib(n), we can get the [0][1] element.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1: [[1,1],[1,0]]^1 = [[1,1],[1,0]]\n\n[0][1] is 1, which is Fib(1)=1. Correct.\n\nn=2: [[1,1],[1,0]]^2 = [[2,1],[1,1]]\n\n[0][1] is 1, which is Fib(2)=1.\n\nn=3: [[1,1],[1,0]]^3 = [[3,2],[2,1]]\n\n[0][1] is 2, which is Fib(3)=2. Correct.\n\nn=0: matrix^0 is identity, [0][1] is 0, which matches Fib(0)=0.\n\nSo yes, to get Fib(n), compute matrix^n and take [0][1] element.\n\nSo the plan for the matrix exponent function is:\n\n- Define the base matrix.\n- Raise it the nth power.\n- Return the [0][1] element.\n\nNow, how to perform matrix exponentiation.\n\nI'll need a helper function to multiply two 2x2 matrices and another helper to perform exponentiation via exponentiation by squaring.\n\nSo:\ndef multiply(m1, m2):\n    # multiply two 2x2 matrices\n    a = m1[0][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][0]\n    b = m1[0][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][1]\n    c = m1[1][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][0]\n    d = m1[1][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][1]\n    return [[a, b], [c, d]]\n\ndef matrix_power(matrix, power):\n    # Initialize result as identity matrix\n    result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    while power > 0:\n        if power % 2 == 1:\n            result = multiply(result, matrix)\n        matrix = multiply(matrix, matrix)\n        power = power // 2\n    return result\n\nThen, for Fibonacci, compute the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] raised to the nth power, and return [0][1].\n\nSo for each function:\n\nImplementing the iterative first.\n\nNow, let's consider possible edge cases.\n\nFor n=0, returning 0.\n\nFor n=1, returning 1.\n\nFor n=2, 1, etc.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nTesting the iterative function:\n\nn=0 \u2192 0\n\nn=1 \u21921\n\nn=2 \u21921\n\nn=10 \u219255.\n\nLooks correct.\n\nFor the recursive function, memoization is needed.\n\nBut having the default argument memo={} could have issues with multiple function calls, but it's the intended behavior.\n\nTesting the recursive function:\n\nfibonacci_recursive(0) \u21920.\n\nfibonacci_recursive(1)\u21921.\n\nfibonacci_recursive(2)\u21921+0=1. Wait no, Fib(2)=1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut without memoization, recursive function would be very slow. But with memo, it's okay.\n\nNow, the Binet function. Some code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef fibonacci_binets(n: int) -> int:\n    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)\n    phi = (1 + sqrt5) / 2\n    psi = (1 - sqrt5) / 2\n    return int( (phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt5 + 0.5 )\n\nWait, but let's test for n=0: (1 -1)/sqrt5 =0 \u2192 added 0.5 becomes 0.5, then integer is 0. Correct.\n\nn=1: (phi - psi)/sqrt(5) = ( (1 + sqrt5 -1 + sqrt5)/2 ) / sqrt5 = (2 sqrt5/2 ) / sqrt5 = sqrt5 / sqrt5 =1 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (phi^2 - psi^2)/sqrt5 \u2192  Which is ( (phi + psi)*(phi - psi) ) / sqrt5. phi + psi =1, phi - psi = sqrt5. So 1 * sqrt5 / sqrt5 =1 \u2192 return 1 correct.\n\nn=10: the formula should compute 55 as Fib(10).\n\nBut maybe the precision holds here.\n\nBut for very large exponents, does Binet's formula lose precision?\n\nYes, because floating points can't represent large exponents exactly, which would cause the result to be slightly off, leading to incorrect rounding. However, the test cases here don't require n larger than 50, which seems manageable.\n\nSo perhaps the Binet's formula function is correct.\n\nNow the matrix function.\n\nImplement helper functions.\n\nAlternatively, to write code without helper functions, perhaps.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to implement multiply and matrix power within the function.\n\nBut in Python, can define inner functions.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef fibonacci_matrix(n: int) -> int:\n    def multiply(m1, m2):\n        a = m1[0][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][0]\n        b = m1[0][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][1]\n        c = m1[1][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][0]\n        d = m1[1][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][1]\n        return [[a, b], [c, d]]\n    \n    def matrix_pow(matrix, power):\n        result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n        while power >0:\n            if power %2 ==1:\n                result = multiply(result, matrix)\n            matrix = multiply(matrix, matrix)\n            power = power //2\n        return result\n    \n    if n ==0:\n        return 0\n    matrix = [[1,1], [1,0]]\n    power = n\n    res_matrix = matrix_pow(matrix, power)\n    return res_matrix[0][1]\n\nWait, because res_matrix = matrix^power.\n\nBut as per previous observation, matrix^power's [0][1] is Fib(power) which is Fib(n). So when n is 1, it's1; when n=2, returns1, correct.\n\nTesting n=20: must return6765. Let's see what the code returns.\n\nBut perhaps the function returns correctly.\n\nSo that's the plan for each function.\n\nNow, writing each function in Python, considering all edge cases.\n\nTesting the functions with the given examples.\n\nFor iterative:\n\nTest n=0 \u21920, n=1 \u21921, n=2\u21921, n=10 \u219255.\n\nYes.\n\nFor recursive:\n\nSame as iterative.\n\nFor Binet: Same as other methods.\n\nMatrix exponent: same.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nn=0: All functions return 0.\n\nn=1: All return 1.\n\nBut for the matrix function, when n=0 returns 0.\n\nBut for other functions, is the handling correct.\n\nPotential pitfalls:\n\n- Handling n=0 and n=1 correctly.\n\n- For the recursive function, initial memo is empty, so it's important to handle the base cases correctly.\n\nPossible mistakes:\n\nIn the recursive function, code memoization correctly. For n=2, it should be Fib(1)+Fib(0)=1+0=1.\n\nAnother issue: the Binet function when n is large may not wrap correctly, but according to test cases, n=50 is correct.\n\nTesting:\n\nCalculating Fib(10) via Binet's formula.\n\nF(10)=55.\n\nphi^10 \u2248 ( (1+sqrt(5))/2 )^10 \u2248 approx, then same for psi^10, but the subtraction and division gives 55.\n\nThus, code should handle that.\n\nThus, all four functions are covered.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the n-th Fibonacci number using four different methods: iterative, recursive with memoization, Binet's formula, and matrix exponentiation. Each method has its own approach and efficiency, allowing us to understand the problem from different angles.\n\n### Approach Overview\n\n1. **Iterative Method**: This approach uses a simple loop to calculate Fibonacci numbers iteratively. It is efficient and easy to understand, with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n2. **Recursive Method with Memoization**: This method uses recursion with memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations. This reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear, O(n).\n\n3. **Binet's Formula**: This method uses a mathematical formula involving the golden ratio to compute Fibonacci numbers directly. It is efficient for small values of n but can suffer from floating-point precision issues for very large n.\n\n4. **Matrix Exponentiation**: This method leverages the properties of matrix multiplication to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. By exponentiating a specific 2x2 matrix, we can achieve a time complexity of O(log n), making it very efficient for large values of n.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_iterative(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the n-th Fibonacci number using iteration.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n\ndef fibonacci_recursive(n: int, memo={}) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization.\"\"\"\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    res = fibonacci_recursive(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2, memo)\n    memo[n] = res\n    return res\n\nimport math\n\ndef fibonacci_binets(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the n-th Fibonacci number using Binet's formula.\"\"\"\n    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)\n    phi = (1 + sqrt5) / 2\n    psi = (1 - sqrt5) / 2\n    return int((phi**n - psi**n) / sqrt5 + 0.5)\n\ndef fibonacci_matrix(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the n-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.\"\"\"\n    def multiply(m1, m2):\n        a = m1[0][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][0]\n        b = m1[0][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[0][1] * m2[1][1]\n        c = m1[1][0] * m2[0][0] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][0]\n        d = m1[1][0] * m2[0][1] + m1[1][1] * m2[1][1]\n        return [[a, b], [c, d]]\n    \n    def matrix_power(matrix, power):\n        result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n        while power > 0:\n            if power % 2 == 1:\n                result = multiply(result, matrix)\n            matrix = multiply(matrix, matrix)\n            power = power // 2\n        return result\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    matrix = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    powered_matrix = matrix_power(matrix, n)\n    return powered_matrix[0][1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Iterative Method**: This function initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers. It iterates from 2 to n, updating `a` and `b` to the next Fibonacci number in each iteration. The result after n iterations is the n-th Fibonacci number.\n\n2. **Recursive Method with Memoization**: This function uses a dictionary `memo` to store already computed Fibonacci numbers. For each call, it checks if the value is already in `memo`. If not, it computes the value recursively and stores it in `memo` before returning. This avoids redundant calculations and significantly improves efficiency.\n\n3. **Binet's Formula**: This function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the closed-form formula derived from the golden ratio. It computes the values of \u03c6 (phi) and \u03c8 (psi), then uses these to find the Fibonacci number. The result is rounded to the nearest integer to handle floating-point precision issues.\n\n4. **Matrix Exponentiation**: This function uses matrix multiplication to compute the n-th Fibonacci number efficiently. It defines helper functions to multiply two 2x2 matrices and to exponentiate a matrix using exponentiation by squaring. The matrix exponentiation method allows us to compute the Fibonacci number in O(log n) time by raising a specific transformation matrix to the power of n and extracting the appropriate element.\n\nEach method offers a unique approach to solving the problem, providing options for different efficiency and complexity requirements.",
