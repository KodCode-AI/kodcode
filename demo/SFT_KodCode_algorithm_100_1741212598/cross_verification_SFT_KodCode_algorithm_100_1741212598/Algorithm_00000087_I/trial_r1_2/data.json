  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called bin_to_octal that converts a binary string into its octal equivalent. The function should be efficient, especially for very long strings, and should handle various edge cases.\n\nFirst, let's think about the problem. The function takes a binary string, so the input is a string composed of 0s and 1s. The output is the octal equivalent as a string.\n\nBut wait, there's also handling of non-binary strings. So, I need to check if the input string contains only 0s and 1s. If it contains any other characters, I should raise a ValueError.\n\nHmm, okay. So the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Validate the input.\n2. Convert the binary string into an octal string.\n3. Ensure the function works efficiently, even for very large strings (like 1e6 characters), so I should avoid creating unnecessary intermediate structures.\n\nLet's break down each step.\n\nStep 1: Validating the input. How do I do this?\n\nI can check each character in the string. If any character is not '0' or '1', then it's invalid. So for each char in bin_string, check if it's in {'0', '1'}. Alternatively, I can use a regex or a simple loop.\n\nWait, but for a very long string, say a million characters, using a loop could be time-consuming. But what's the alternative? Maybe for each character, check if it is '0' or '1'. Because if the string is invalid, we can return early, and maybe that's more efficient than processing the entire string.\n\nYes, so I'll loop through each character in bin_string:\n\nfor char in bin_string:\n    if char not in {'0', '1'}:\n        raise ValueError(\"Non-binary value...\")\n\nBut wait, what about the empty string? The function says to return an empty string if the input is empty. So, if bin_string is empty, return ''.\n\nSo first check if the length is 0. Return ''. Else, proceed to validate each character.\n\nOkay. So step 1 involves first handling the empty string case, then validating each character.\n\nStep 2: Convert binary to octal.\n\nWhat's the usual way to convert a binary string to octal? Well, in Python, you can do int(binary_str, 2) to get an integer, then oct() to get the octal string, but then you have to strip the '0o' prefix.\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nExample 1: bin_to_octal(\"1111\") should return '17'.\n\nCompute 1111 in binary is 15 in decimal. 15 divided by 8 is 1, remainder 7. So 17 in octal.\n\nUsing int(\"1111\", 2) gives 15. Then oct(15) is '0o17', so [2:] would get '17'.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nAnother example: \"101010101010011\" converts to 2B0B in hex? Wait wait, let's see:\n\nWait, wait\u2014 no, the correct example is that the function returns '52523' for that input. So that method works.\n\nWait, let's see: \"101010101010011\" is binary. Converting to decimal first, then octal, would work.\n\nBut the problem is that for really large binary strings, converting to an integer might not be efficient. Because the binary string can be 1e6 characters long.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because a million bits is a number with around 300,000 decimal digits. Representing that as an integer in Python may not be feasible because it's a very large number, and could cause memory issues or be very slow.\n\nSo for very large binary strings, the usual method of converting to an integer first may not be efficient enough or could even cause performance issues or crashes.\n\nSo, what's the alternative? We need a way to convert binary to octal without converting the entire binary string into a huge integer at once.\n\nI remember that octal is base 8, which is a power of 2 (2^3). So each group of three bits can be converted into an octal digit (0-7). So perhaps we can process the binary string in chunks of three bits, left-padded with zeros as needed, and then for each chunk, compute the octal digit and build the result.\n\nBut handling that could be a bit more involved.\n\nWait, how is that done?\n\nLet me explain:\n\n1. The binary string is processed to group into sets of 3 bits, starting from the right.\n2. If the total number of bits isn't a multiple of 3, the leftmost group will have leading zeros.\n3. For each 3-bit group, determine the corresponding octal digit.\n4. Concatenate all digits to form the octal string.\n\nSo, here's a sample:\n\nBinary string: '1111' is 4 bits. To group into 3, we pad it to 6 bits? Or 3? Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, '1111' is four bits. So to process from the right, the groupings would be '1' '111'. Wait, no, groupings are from the right, so in this case, we have the groupings as '1' '111' if the length is four.\n\nWait, wait, I think the correct way is:\n\nPad the binary string on the left with leading zeros so that the total length is a multiple of 3. Then, split into chunks of 3 bits starting from the left.\n\nWait no, because when grouping, you typically group from the right (LSB end).\n\nSo for example, '121' (3 bits) is '1' in octal.\n\nBut for four bits, '1111', grouping as '1 111' (from right) gives '1' as 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^2 = 7, and '1' as 1*2^0: but wait, that's reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternative approach: process the binary string in reverse.\n\nLet me think. For each position in the binary string, starting from the end, we take three bits, starting from the right. So for the example '1111':\n\nBinary digits are '1 1 1 1', so position 3 to 0 (0-based). So from right, the first group is the last three bits\u2014 but wait, in four bits, the first group can be taken as the last two bits and then the next group is the first two bits? Or perhaps we can pad the binary string with leading zeros so that it becomes a length that is a multiple of 3.\n\nYes. So for '1111', which is four bits, we can pad it with two leading zeros to make it '001111', then group into two groups: '00', '1111'? No, wait, wait:\n\nWait, wait, no: when padding for grouping into 3 bits, you should pad the left side. So for '1111' (4 bits), add 2 zeros at the beginning to make it length 6: '001111'. Then split into two groups: '00' '1111' (wait, no; three bits each). Wait\u2014 oh wait, 6 bits divided by 3 is 2 groups. So '001111' can be split into '00' '111', which is 2 groups of 3 bits each. No, wait, no: '001111' is 001 and 111. So each group is 001 and 111, but wait\u2014 no, because 001 is 1 in 3 bits and 111 is 7, so 1 and 7. So the octal is 17, which is correct.\n\nWait, another example: '101010101010011' is 15 bits long. 15 is a multiple of 3, so no padding needed. So split into 5 groups of 3 bits each.\n\nWait, let me see that: 15 bits \u2192 15 / 3 = 5 groups. Each group is:\n\n1 010 101 010 011? Wait no, no, the grouping starts from the right. So for 15 bits, it's grouped as the last 3 bits, then the preceding 3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps regardless of the position, after appropriate padding, each group of 3 bits is converted.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to first determine the length. If the length mod 3 is not zero, pad the binary string with (3 - (length mod 3)) leading zeros. Then split into groups of 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for a binary string like '1101' (four bits), pad with two zeros, becoming '001101'. Then split into '00' and '1101'? No, wait, 001 and 101. Wait, 6 bits \u2192 2 groups of 3: 001 and 101.\n\nSo each group is 3 bits, starting from the beginning (after padding).\n\nWait, no\u2014 no, when grouping for octal, it's more efficient to group the binary digits starting from the right. So for the binary string '1111', which is 4 bits:\n\nWe need to pad it with 2 zeros on the left, making '001111'. Then we group them starting from the right, but since the total length is 6, which is a multiple of 3, the grouping is straightforward. So, groups are '001' (which is 1) and '111' (which is 7). So the octal is '17'.\n\nAnother example: '111' \u2192 group as is \u2192 7 \u2192 octal '7'.\n\nAnother example: '1010' \u2192 4 bits \u2192 pad with two zeros to make 6 bits \u2192 '001010'. Split into '001' (1) and '010' (2) \u2192 octal '12'.\n\nWait 1010 is 10 in decimal, which is 12 in octal. Correct.\n\nBut what about left padding versus when other groupings happen. Wait, perhaps I should pad with leading zeros so that when the grouping is done in chunks of 3, starting from the beginning.\n\nWait, I think that approach will work.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Check if the input is a valid binary string.\n- If the string is empty, return empty.\n- Pad the binary string with leading zeros until the length is a multiple of 3.\n- Split into chunks of 3 bits, from left to right (each chunk represents 3 bits).\n- For each chunk, compute its octal digit (0-7), then append that to the result.\n- The final concatenated string is the octal representation.\n\nYes. So processing in 3 bits, each group of 3 bits gives an octal digit.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nBut again, for a 1e6-bit string, adding padding could require creating a new string with up to (3 - (len % 3)) zeros. But 1e6 is exactly divisible by 3 (assuming len is 1e6), but for len 1e6 -1, it's 3 - (999999 +1 ) mod 3 \u2192 (1e6 -1) mod 3 is 999999 mod3 is 0, so wait.\n\nWait 999999 is divisible by 3? 9+9+9+9+9+9 is 54 \u2192 54 is divisible by 3 \u2192 yes. So for 999,999, adding 3 - (999,999 mod3) which is 0 (since 999,999 mod3 is 0 when other terms? So no need to pad.)\n\nWait, len is 1e6, which is 1000000 mod3 = 1e6 /3 is 333,333 groups of 3. 1e6 mod3 \u2192 sum of digits? Wait, no\u2014 1e6 is 1 followed by 6 zeros. 1 mod3 is 1. So 1000000 /3 is 333333 with a remainder of 1. So the mod3 is 1.\n\nWait no: 3 \u00d7 333333 = 999,999. 1e6 is 999,999 +1 \u2192 mod3 is 1.\n\nSo for len = 1e6, padding would be 3 - (1e6 mod3) \u2192 3-1=2 zeros. So the code would add two leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nbin_str = '10101010' (length 8). 8 mod3 is 2 \u2192 3-2=1 \u2192 pad with 1 leading zero \u2192 '010101010' (wait, wait, no: bin_str is '10101010' which is 8 bits. 8 mod3 is 2. So 3-2 =1 \u2192 pad one leading zero. So the padded string is '0' + '10101010' \u2192 '010101010'. So len is 9.\n\nThen split into 3 bits each:\n\n'010 101 010' \u2192 each group is '010' (2), '101' (5), '010' (2). So octal is 252.\n\nWait, '10101010' is binary 170 decimal. 170 in octal is indeed 252.\n\nWait, no: wait '10101010' is:\n\n128 + 32 + 8 + 2 \u2192 128+32=160 +8=168+2=170. In octal, 170 is 2*64 +5*8= 128+40=168, plus 2 \u2192 170 - 2*64=42 \u2192 42 /8=5 *8=40 \u2192 42-40=2 \u2192 252. Correct.\n\nYes, so this approach works.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n- Check for empty string \u2192 return empty.\n\n- Else, validate each character is 0 or 1. Raise ValueError if not.\n\n- Compute padding: mod3 = len(bin_str) %3. pad = 3 - mod3 if mod3 !=0 else 0. So pad is 0 to 2.\n\n- Pad the bin_str with pad zeros at the beginning.\n\n- Then, split into chunks of 3 characters.\n\n- For each 3-character chunk, convert it into its octal digit (0-7).\n\n- Concatenate all digits to form the octal string.\n\nBut wait, the first zero may not matter, but when the leading chunk is all zeros? For example, if the bin_str is '000000', after padding, it's '000000' \u2192 octal is 0 then 0. But the output is '00'? Or wait, wait:\n\nWait, '000000' in binary is 0, but octal is 0. Wait, but wait: our code would create two chunks of 3 bits each, both being '000' \u2192 each is zero, so in the octal string '00', which is a problem, but the correct octal is '0'.\n\nSo we need to avoid leading zeros in the octal string. Wait, that's another thing. For instance:\n\nIf the binary string is all zeros, the padding may result in a longer zero chain, but the octal should be zero, not a string of zeros.\n\nThus, the code's output may have leading zeros which need to be stripped.\n\nWait no, because when pad is added, which may add leading zeros, but the overall binary string, when converted to octal, should lead to leading zeros being part of the string, but which in octal are leading.\n\nWait wait: leading zeros are allowed in octal representations. For example, '0017' is the same as '17', but as a string, we can return '17'.\n\nBut depending on the function's requirements, do we need to return the minimal representation or not?\n\nThe example given is bin_to_octal(\"1111\") \u2192 returns '17', which is correct, not '017' or whatever.\n\nSo to avoid leading zeros in the octal string, perhaps the code needs to remove any leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in some cases, leading zeros may be correct.\n\nFor example, the binary string is '000000' \u2192 which is 0 in binary \u2192 0 in octal. The correct output is '0', not '00' or '000'.\n\nAnother example: the binary string is '000100' \u2192 if we pad... Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal bin_str is '000100' \u2192 6 bits \u2192 6 mod3 is 0 \u2192 pad is 0. So no padding needed. Then, split into two 3-bit groups: '000' and '100'. Each is 0 and 4. So octal is '04'? But that's not correct because 000100 is 4 in decimal (4 is 4 in octal as '4'). So the function should return '4'.\n\nAh, so when we split into groups of 3, starting from the beginning, the leading group being 000 is okay, but the resulting octal has leading zeros that should be stripped, except if the entire string is zero.\n\nSo what's the correct way to handle leading zeros in the octal string after processing all the 3-bit groups?\n\nWe need to produce the minimal string\u2014 stripping any leading zeros. But wait, what about the case when the number is zero? Then the output should be a single '0'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nAfter converting the padded binary string into the octal string, if the octal string is all zeros, return '0', else, remove leading zeros and then return. Or, perhaps, better to handle this during the conversion.\n\nWait, how can that be done.\n\nAfter padding and grouping, each group is converted into a digit. The result is a string of octal digits. So for '000000', after grouping, the octal digits would be '00' (two groups), but the correct output is '0'.\n\nHmm, So we need to determine if the entire binary string is zero. Because if it is, the octal is zero.\n\nWait, but it's better to process the octal digits and then strip leading zeros, and if the result is empty, return '0'; else, return the stripped result.\n\nWait, for '000000', the padding will be zero, groups are '000' '000' \u2192 octal digits are 0 and 0 \u2192 '00' \u2192 when stripped, it becomes empty string, which would be considered as 0.\n\nBut the function should return '0' in this case.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nAfter grouping and converting to octal digits, form the octal string, then:\n\n- If all characters are '0's, return '0'.\n\n- Else, remove leading zeros except for the first non-zero digit. If the entire string is zeros, that's handled as '0'.\n\nWait, no: consider 0 is allowed, but any octal string with leading zeros should be stripped except the single '0' when it's the entire string.\n\nSo perhaps, after forming the octal digits as a string, we can compute:\n\nStrip leading zeros.\n\nHowever, if the result is empty, then it's zero, so return '0'.\n\nElse, return the stripped string.\n\nThus, for '000100' \u2192 grouped as '000' and '100' \u2192 octal digits '04' \u2192 the octal string is '04' \u2192 stripping leading zeros gives '4', which is correct.\n\nAnother example: '1111' \u2192 padded as '001111' \u2192 groups '001' (1) and '111' (7) \u2192 octal '17' \u2192 no leading zeros.\n\n'000000' \u2192 groups '000' and '000' \u2192 digital string '00' \u2192 stripped to '' \u2192 return '0'.\n\n'00' is 0 in binary. So the padding is 1 zero (for len 2 mod3=2 \u2192 1 pad). So total len is3. So '000' \u2192 group is '000' \u2192 octal string '0' \u2192 so not stripped, return '0'.\n\nYes, that would correctly handle all cases.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps are:\n\n1. Check if input is empty string \u2192 return ''.\n\n2. Check each character is '0' or '1'. If not, raise ValueError.\n\n3. If the bin_str is all '0's \u2192 return '0'.\n\n4. Else, proceed to pad with leading zeros to make len a multiple of 3.\n\n5. Split into groups of 3 bits each, starting from left.\n\n6. For each group, compute the octal digit (integer value of 3-bit binary) \u2192 append to octal_str.\n\nWait, no. The group is 3 bits; the value of that group is the binary number's value as an integer, which will be 0-7, so the octal digit.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nFor a 3-character string like '001', its value is 0b001 \u2192 1 \u2192 octal digit is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each group of 3 bits, we can compute the integer value and then represent it as a single octal character.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as a string. But for each group, it's a 3-bit string. So, perhaps for each group, convert it to an integer and then to a string.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npad_length = (3 - (len(bin_str) %3 )) %3\n\npadded = '0' * pad_length + bin_str\n\noctal_digits = []\n\nfor i in range(0, len(padded), 3):\n    chunk = padded[i:i+3]\n    digit = str( int( chunk, 2 ) ) # e.g., '000' \u2192 0 \u2192 '0'\n    octal_digits.append( digit )\n\noctal_str = ''.join( octal_digits )\n\n# Now, process octal_str for leading zeros.\n\n# Strip leading zeros\noctal_str = octal_str.lstrip('0')\n\nif len(octal_str) == 0:\n    # All zeros\n    octal_str = '0'\n\nreturn octal_str\n\nWait, but what about the case where the padded string is all zeros, but the octal_str is empty after stripping? We set it to '0'.\n\nWait, no. For example, padded='0000' \u2192 but no, wait, len(bin_str) is 4 \u2192 mod3 is 1 \u2192 pad_length is 2 \u2192 so padded is '00' + '1111' \u2192 len 6 \u2192 splits into 001 111 \u2192 '17'. So for all zero case:\n\nLet's say bin_str is '000' \u2192 len is 3 \u2192 no padding. Padded is '000' \u2192 chunk is '000' \u2192 octal_str is '0' \u2192 lstrip gives '' \u2192 so octal_str is set to '0'. Correct.\n\nAnother example: bin_str is '000000' \u2192 len 6 \u2192 no pad. groups are '000' and '000' \u2192 '0' and '0' \u2192 octal_str is '00' \u2192 lstrip is empty \u2192 set to '0' \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: bin_str '000110' \u2192 len is 6 \u2192 no pad. groups are '000' and '110' \u2192 digits '0' and 6 \u2192 '06' \u2192 lstrip '6' \u2192 So returns '6'. But '06' in octal when converted as lstrip is '6', but the binary string is 6, which is correct.\n\nYes, this approach handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nBut let's think about leading zeros in the octal_str.\n\nWait, but what about if bin_str is '000111111' \u2192 len 9 \u2192 pad zero groups are all '000' \u2192 0, '111' \u2192 7, '111' \u21927 \u2192 octal_str is 077 \u2192 lstrip zeros gives '77' \u2192 which is correct.\n\nWait, but 000111111 is 7 * 8 + 7= 63 in decimal. 63 is 77 in octal. Correct.\n\nSo, our code would produce '077' \u2192 stripped to '77', which is correct.\n\nSo now, the final step is to lstrip the zeros and then return '0' if the result is empty.\n\nBut also, if the bin_str is all zeros, like '00000', after padding, which is len 3, then the group is 3 zeros \u2192 so stripped would be empty \u2192 set to '0'.\n\nSo, combining all the steps.\n\nNow, the code structure would be something like:\n\ndef bin_to_octal(bin_string: str) -> str:\n    # handle empty string\n    if not bin_string:\n        return ''\n    # validate characters\n    for c in bin_string:\n        if c not in {'0','1'}:\n            raise ValueError(\"Non-binary value was passed to the function\")\n    # now, check if the bin_string is all zeros\n    if bin_string.strip('0') == '':\n        return '0'\n    # compute pad\n    pad = (3 - (len(bin_string) %3 )) %3\n    padded = '0' * pad + bin_string\n    octal_digits = []\n    for i in range(0, len(padded), 3):\n        chunk = padded[i:i+3]\n        digit = str( int(chunk, 2) )\n        octal_digits.append( digit )\n    octal_str = ''.join(octal_digits)\n    # strip leading zeros\n    stripped = octal_str.lstrip('0')\n    if not stripped:\n        return '0'\n    return stripped\n\nWait a second, but in the case where the binary string is all zeros, the code correctly returns '0'. What about if the binary string is '0'?\n\nIn the all-zero check:\n\nif bin_string.strip('0') == '': \u2192 that would include '0' which stripped is '' \u2192 returns '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nFirst, handle empty string.\n\nThen, check each character; if any non-0 or 1, raise error.\n\nThen, check if all zeros by stripping everything and checking if empty \u2192 yes \u2192 return '0'.\n\nElse, proceed with padding.\n\nSo this handles the all-zero case.\n\nWait, but what about the following? Because for example, if the binary string is zero-padded.\n\nWait, but the function is given a string which is a binary number. Leading zeros are handled in the function because after processing, any leading zeros in the octal string are stripped, except when necessary.\n\nSo, if the binary string is '00010100', which is 20 in decimal or 24 in octal, the code should process it as 24.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\npad is (3 - (len(8) mod3 )) \u2192 8 mod3 is 2 \u2192 3-2=1 \u2192 pad with one zero to make len 9. So padded is '000010100' \u2192 no, wait:\n\nWait no, 8+1=9?\n\nWait, '00010100' is length 8. 8 mod3 is 2 \u2192 pad 1 zero \u2192 '0'+ '00010100' \u2192 len 9 \u2192 groups are 000, 101, 00 \u2192 wait no:\n\nWait, the code groups every 3 bits.\n\nSo the padded string is '0' + '00010100' \u2192 '000010100' \u2192 length 9 \u2192 groups 000 (0), 010 (2), 100 (4) \u2192 so octal digits are 0,2,4 \u2192 '024' \u2192 after stripping \u2192 '24', which is correct.\n\nWait, yes, because 20 in decimal is 24 in octal.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: '1111' \u2192 len 4 \u2192 pad 2 zeros \u2192 '001111' \u2192 groups '00' (00 is 000 \u2192 wait, wait wait: no, groups are made in 3 bits:\n\npad = 2 (3-4%3 = 3-1=2) \u2192 '00' + '1111' \u2192 '001111' \u2192 groups '001' and '111' \u2192 1 and7 \u2192 17 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nBut perhaps in the for loop, for i in range(0, len(padded), 3): which increments by 3 each time.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut, the code is processing each 3 bits, converts to the digit, appends, then after, do the stripping.\n\nAnother thing to note: for a 1e6-length binary string, this method processes each 3 bits, creating a million digits, but is it efficient? Because nothing is being built as a huge integer, it's handled in small groups of 3.\n\nYes, and memory-wise, the padded string for 1e6 bits could be up to 1e6 +2 (pad of 2) characters. Looping through 3-character chunks is manageable.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nBut perhaps, we can optimize it even more.\n\nWait, the current code appends each digit (as a string) into a list, then joins into a string. So for 1e6 digits, it's manageable.\n\nBut another approach is to avoid using the list and the string appending.\n\nBut perhaps, for such a problem, it's more straightforward to proceed as the code is.\n\nAlternatively, can I find a way to compute the octal string without converting each 3 bits, thus avoiding the loop?\n\nBut I think not. Each 3 bits must be processed to get the octal.\n\nSo the code as is should be efficient.\n\nTesting the code with the given examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nbin_to_octal(\"1111\") should return '17'.\n\nOur code:\n\nbin_string is '1111' \u2192 not empty, valid. Not all zeros.\n\npad = 3-4%3=3-1=2. padded string is '001111' \u2192 groups '001' (1), '111' (7) \u2192 octal_str '17' \u2192 stripped and returns '17' \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nbin_to_octal(\"101010101010011\") should return '52523'.\n\nWait, the binary is 15 bits. len 15 mod3=0 \u2192 pad is 0 \u2192 no pad. Split into 5 groups:\n\nLet's compute each group:\n\nThe binary string is '101010101010011'.\n\nSplit into groups of 3:\n\n'101' 010 101 010 011.\n\nWait, how? Let's see:\n\nThe string is '101 010 101 010 011' \u2192 groups:\n\n'101' \u21925 \u2192 '5'\n\n'010' \u2192 2 \u2192 '2'\n\n'101' \u21925 \u2192 '5'\n\n'010' \u21922 \u2192 '2'\n\n'011' \u21923 \u2192 '3'?\n\nWait, wait, 5 2 5 2 3 \u2192 So concatenated: '52523' \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, the code would handle this.\n\nAnother example: bin_to_octal(\"0\") \u2192 returns '0' \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test: bin_to_octal(\"\") \u2192 '' \u2192 correct.\n\nWhen non-binary string is passed, like 'a-1', the for loop would find 'a', which is not in {'0', '1'}, and raise ValueError.\n\nAnother test: bin_to_octal(\"100\") \u2192 len3 \u2192 padded len3. group '100' \u2192 which is 4 \u2192 octal '4' \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nSo, I think this approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the all-zeroes case.\n\nFor bin_string being '0000' \u2192 len4 \u2192 not all-zeroes? Wait, no: '0000' is all zeroes.\n\nIn the code:\n\nAfter the initial 'strip' step, bin_string.strip('0') is empty \u2192 So returns '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should correctly return '0' for all-zero strings.\n\nAnother test case: bin_to_octal(\"101\") \u2192 which is 5 \u2192 octal is '5' \u2192 code will split into '101' \u2192 5 \u2192 '5' stripped \u2192 returns '5'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo, the function should be implemented as per above logic.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a binary string into its octal equivalent efficiently while handling edge cases such as empty strings and non-binary values. The solution should be optimized to handle very large binary strings (up to 10^6 characters) efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input string is empty and return an empty string if true. Ensure all characters in the string are either '0' or '1'; if not, raise a ValueError.\n2. **Handle All-Zero Case**: If the input string consists entirely of zeros, return '0'.\n3. **Padding**: Compute the necessary padding to make the length of the binary string a multiple of 3. This ensures that we can split the string into groups of 3 bits for octal conversion.\n4. **Octal Conversion**: Split the padded binary string into groups of 3 bits. Convert each group to its corresponding octal digit.\n5. **Result Processing**: Strip any leading zeros from the resulting octal string. If the result is empty after stripping, return '0'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef bin_to_octal(bin_string: str) -> str:\n    if not bin_string:\n        return ''\n    for c in bin_string:\n        if c not in {'0', '1'}:\n            raise ValueError(\"Non-binary value was passed to the function\")\n    if bin_string.strip('0') == '':\n        return '0'\n    pad = (3 - (len(bin_string) % 3)) % 3\n    padded = '0' * pad + bin_string\n    octal_digits = []\n    for i in range(0, len(padded), 3):\n        chunk = padded[i:i+3]\n        digit = str(int(chunk, 2))\n        octal_digits.append(digit)\n    octal_str = ''.join(octal_digits)\n    stripped = octal_str.lstrip('0')\n    return stripped if stripped else '0'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input string is empty and returns an empty string. It then validates each character to ensure they are either '0' or '1'.\n2. **All-Zero Handling**: If the input string, when stripped of all zeros, is empty, it means the string was composed entirely of zeros, and the function returns '0'.\n3. **Padding**: The binary string is padded with leading zeros to ensure its length is a multiple of 3. This allows processing in consistent 3-bit chunks.\n4. **Octal Conversion**: The padded string is split into 3-bit chunks. Each chunk is converted to its octal equivalent and collected into a list.\n5. **Result Processing**: The list of octal digits is joined into a string. Leading zeros are stripped to ensure the result is the minimal representation. If the result is empty (all zeros), it returns '0'.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient handling of large binary strings by avoiding the creation of large intermediate integer values and processing the string in manageable chunks.",
