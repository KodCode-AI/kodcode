  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to interleave two strings. Hmm. So wait, what's interleaving exactly? Oh right, like you take the first character from each string alternately. But what if one is longer than the other? Then you just append the remaining part. Right.\n\nLooking at the examples, when first_str is \"ABCD\" and second is \"XY\", the result is \"AXBYCD\". Oh right, because A and X are first, then B and Y, but then the second string is done, so the rest of first_str (CD) is added. Similarly when second string is longer, like in another example.\n\nSo the approach is to go through each index, take a character from first_str if it exists, then from second_str if it exists, and keep doing until all characters are processed.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently. Since the constraints say that the function must handle strings up to 10^5 characters in length, so the solution needs to be O(n), where n is the total length, without any unnecessary computations.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, find the maximum length between the two strings. Then, for each index from 0 to max_length-1, add the character from first_str if it's available at that index, then from second_str if available.\n\nWait, but in which order? Because in each step, you take a character from the first string first, then the second. So the interleaving is first_str_0, second_str_0, then first_str_1, second_str_1, and so on.\n\nSo the algorithm can be:\n\nInitialize an empty list (since strings are immutable and appending to a list is efficient).\n\nFind the length of each string: len1 and len2.\n\nLoop over i from 0 to the maximum of len1 and len2.\n\nFor each i:\n- if i < len1: add first_str[i] to the result.\n- if i < len2: add second_str[i] to the result.\n\nWait, no. Because in the examples, like interleave_strings(\"ABCD\", \"XY\"), the result is AXBYCD. So the order is A X B Y C D. Wait no, the strings are \"ABCD\" and \"XY\". So the steps are:\ni=0: take A, then X.\ni=1: take B, then Y.\ni=2: take C, but second_str has nothing, so only C is added.\ni=3: take D, same as above.\n\nSo the loop up to max(len1, len2) but on each index, get first_str[i] if possible, then second_str[i] if possible.\n\nWait, no, because that would make it first_str comes before second_str in each pair. So in the first example, it's correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for each i in range(max(len1, len2)):\n\nBut wait, if one string is longer than the other, after some i's, one string has no more characters, so we just stop.\n\nWait, but in the loop, for each i, we first check if i is less than len1, then add the first string's i-th character. Then check if i is less than len2, add the second's i-th character.\n\nBut for i beyond the length of a string, nothing is added.\n\nSo for i in 0 to max(len1, len2) -1:\n\nBut wait, what about when the loop runs beyond the shorter string's length? Suppose i is 3: for \"ABCD\" (len 4) and \"XY\" (len 2), i goes up to 3.\n\nAt i=2: check len1 (4) >2? Yes, so add C. Then check len2 if 2>2? No, so nothing. So added C only.\n\nAt i=3: for len1, add D. len2 is beyond, so nothing. So D is added.\n\nThus, the code would collect all the correct letters.\n\nWait, but wait: in i=0: A and X are added: aX becomes 'AX'.\n\ni=1: B and Y: becomes 'B Y', so overall 'AXBY'.\n\ni=2: C is added. nothing from second.\n\ni=3: D is added.\n\nSo the result would be 'AXBYCD', which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: interleave_strings(\"XY\", \"ABCD\") returns 'XAYBCD'.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAt i=0: X (from first_str) and A (from second), so 'XA'.\n\ni=1: Y (from first) and B (second): 'YB' added. So string is XAYB.\n\ni=2: Now, first_str has length 2, so when i=2, it's beyond. So we take the second_str[2] which is C. Then same for i=3: D is taken.\n\nWait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, the first_str is \"XY\" (len2=2). Wait, first_str is first argument, so in this example, first_str is \"XY\" (len=2), second_str is \"ABCD\" (len=4).\n\nSo for each i:\n\ni=0: first_str[0] = X added, then second_str[0] = A added. So 'XA'.\n\ni=1: Y and B. 'YB --> XAYB.\n\ni=2: i is 2. 2 is beyond len(first_str) (2) so no action for first. But i <4, so add second[2] = C. So now, 'XA' -> 'XA' becomes 'XA YB' + C? Or after i=1, we have 'XAYB', then i=2: X is taken from first? Wait no, in this case, first_str is \"XY\"\u2014i runs up to 3.\n\nWait, for each i:\n\ni=0: add first[0] (X), then second[0] (A) --> strings becomes 'XA'.\n\ni=1: add first[1] (Y), then second[1] (B) --> 'XAYB'.\n\ni=2: add first[2]\u2014but first_str is length 2. So i=2 is beyond, so nothing added from first. Then add second[2] (C). Result so far 'XAYBC'.\n\ni=3: add first[3] is nothing, then add second[3] (D). So overall 'XAYBCD'.\n\nWhich matches the example of \"X\" followed by interleaving, then the remaining.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, in Python, how to loop.\n\nPossible choices:\n\nLoop i in range(max(len1, len2)), and for each i, check if i is less than len1 or len2.\n\nBut we can precompute the maximum length.\n\nImplement it as:\n\nresult = []\nlen1 = len(first_str)\nlen2 = len(second_str)\nmax_len = max(len1, len2)\nfor i in range(max_len):\n    if i < len1:\n        result.append(first_str[i])\n    if i < len2:\n        result.append(second_str[i])\n\nWait, but that would alternate in this way: for each i, add first, then second. Which, according to the first example, would give the correct result.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me simulate for 'AB' (len 2) and 'XYZ' (len 3). The example expects 'AXBYZ'.\n\nWait, that example: the first_str is 'AB', the second is 'XYZ'.\n\nSo len1=2, len2=3.\n\nmax_len is 3.\n\nIn each i:\n\ni=0: add 'A', then 'X' \u2192 'AX'.\n\ni=1: add 'B', then 'Y' \u2192 'AXBY'.\n\ni=2: i=2 is beyond len1, so do not add, but add 'Z' as second_str[2] \u2192 result is 'AXBYZ'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the code proposed earlier, in each i, the first character is added if possible, then the second.\n\nBut the function works as per the expected results.\n\nBut wait another example:\n\nFirst_str is \"ABC\", second_str is empty string. The function should return \"ABC\".\n\nSo len1=3, len2=0.\n\nIn the loop, for i=0 to 2:\n\ni=0: first is in range, add 'A'. Second is not, so no.\n\nSo after each i:\n\nresult after i=0: 'A'.\n\ni=1: 'B' added.\n\ni=2: 'C' added.\n\nSo 'ABC' is correct.\n\nAnother case: second_str is longer and has to be added after the interleaving.\n\nSo code looks correct.\n\nNow, what about the performance?\n\nBecause for 1e5 length strings, the loop runs up to 1e5 times. Which is manageable.\n\nIn Python, each append to a list is O(1) on average, but building a string in a loop via += is O(n^2) since strings are immutable. Thus, using a list and join is the way to go.\n\nHence, the approach is:\n\n- Create an empty list.\n\n- Iterate over each index i from 0 to max(len1, len2) - 1.\n\nFor each i:\n\n   if i is less than len1, take first_str[i] and append to the list.\n\n   if i is less than len2, take second_str[i] and append to the list.\n\nFinally, join the list into a string and return it.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nImplement len1 = len(first_str), len2= len(second_str), max_len = max(len1, len2).\n\nWait, but in Python, it's possible that first_str or second_str is empty. But during the iteration, the i would start from 0.\n\nBut wait no, when i is 0, the loop will run, and append characters from each string.\n\nBut initial testing shows it's correct.\n\nSo code could be:\n\ndef interleave_strings(first_str: str, second_str: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    len1, len2 = len(first_str), len(second_str)\n    max_len = max(len1, len2)\n    for i in range(max_len):\n        if i < len1:\n            result.append(first_str[i])\n        if i < len2:\n            result.append(second_str[i])\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nWait, in the first example: when first_str is 'ABCD' (indices 0,1,2,3) and second_str is 'XY' (indices 0,1).\n\nSo:\n\ni=0: add 'A', then 'X' \u2192 'A X'\n\ni=1: add 'B', then 'Y' \u2192 'B Y'\n\ni=2: add 'C', since len2=2, i=2 is not less than len2, so no.\n\nWait, but len2 is 2. So for i=2, is i < len2? 2 < 2 \u2192 no. So only 'C' is added. Similarly i=3, which is for len1=4, so add D.\n\nSo the result is 'A X B Y C D' \u2192 A, X, B, Y, C, D \u2192 'AXBYCD', which is correct.\n\nWait no, the order is appending 'A', then 'X' in the first iteration, 'B' and 'Y' next, then 'C', then 'D'. So the list becomes ['A', 'X', 'B', 'Y', 'C', 'D'], which joined is 'AXBYCD'.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut another example: 'XY' and 'ABCD.' Result is 'XAYBCD' as per the code.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait wait, but looking at the code again: for i in 0 to max_len-1.\n\nIn each i, it appends first_str[i], if available, then second_str[i], if available.\n\nSo in each step, the order is first_str, then second_str. Oh, wait, but the examples require that the interleaving is first one character from each string, but for the same index. For example, the interleaving of first and second strings is first character of first, then first of second, etc.\n\nYes, but the code, in each i, appends first, then second.\n\nWait, wait, wait!\n\nWait, in the first example, the interleave is first, then second. So wait, perhaps in the code, for i=0, the first character of first_str comes first. But which string is first_str and which is second?\n\nIn the code, the code appends first_str's i-th character, then second_str's i-th character.\n\nWhich is exactly the desired interleaving. So when i is 0, first_str[0], then second_str[0], etc.\n\nYes, that's against the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the function takes first_str and second_str and returns a new string where the characters are interleaved. So alternating between the two.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples:\n\ninterleave_strings(\"ABCD\", \"XY\") returns 'AXBYCD'.\n\nBreaking down the first_str is \"A B C D\", second_str is \"X Y\".\n\nThe interleaved result is A followed by X, B followed by Y, then C D.\n\nWhich is exactly how the code appends first_str[i], then second_str[i] for i=0 to 1 (since second_str has 2 elements).\n\nWait, but wait: in i=0, first is A, second X \u2192 AX.\n\ni=1: B, Y \u2192 BY \u2192 total AXBY.\n\ni=2: C, i=2 >= len2 (2), so C is added.\n\ni=3: D is added.\n\nSo the string becomes 'AXBYCD', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut what about when the second_str is longer, should the code still take the same approach?\n\nYes, because in the code, for i=0, it appends first_str[i], then second_str[i], so even if second_str is longer, their i-th character is handled.\n\nWait, in the example where first_str is XY (length 2) and second_str is ABCD (length4).\n\nAt i=0: X is added, then A \u2192 XA.\n\ni=1: Y, B \u2192 XAYB.\n\ni=2: nothing from first_str, but add C \u2192 XAYBC.\n\ni=3: nothing from first_str, add D \u2192 XAYBCD.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, think again: in the code, for each i, the first_str's i-th character (if exist) is added before the second_str's i-th character. So for the two examples, as i increases, the code appends first_str's i, then second_str's i.\n\nBut in the first case, in each i:\n\ncharacters from first_str are added before second_str. So when we have 'ABCD' and 'XY', the result is first_str[0], second_str[0], first_str[1], second_str[1], and so on. Which is the correct interleaving.\n\nWhat about cases where the strings are of the same length.\n\nLike first_str='abcd', second_str='wxyz'.\n\nThen the result should be 'awbxcyd z', no wait. Let me compute: i=0: a, w, i=1: b, x, i=2: c,y, i=3: d, z. So the result is awbxcydz.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: first_str is 'A' and second_str is 'B': should return 'AB'.\n\nYes: in i=0, 'A' is added, then 'B'.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nThus, the function is correctly implemented.\n\nBut wait wait, what about if the two strings are interleaved in the other way? Like, second_str character before first_str's?\n\nWait, the code adds first_str's character first. But wait, re-examining the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: the function interleaves the two strings. So the order is first_str, then second_str, but for each character.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the examples.\n\nIn the first example:\n\ninterleave_strings(\"ABCD\", \"XY\") returns 'AXBYCD'.\n\nOrder is A, X, B, Y, C, D.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, the first_str is taken first, then the second_str.\n\nWait, but in the code, it's appending first_str's i, then second_str's i. So in i=0, A is first, which is from first_str. Then X from second_str.\n\nWhich leads me to think that for interleaving, the code is placing first_str characters before second_str in each pair.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait wait, wait another example: interleave_strings(\"XY\", \"ABCD\") returns 'XAYBCD.' Let's see.\n\nIn i=0: first_str is 'XY' [i=0] \u2192 'X' added, then second_str's i=0 is 'A' \u2192 'XA'.\n\ni=1: second_str[i=1] is 'B', which is added.\n\ni=2: second_str[i=2] is 'C' added.\n\ni=3: 'D' added.\n\nWait, the code is against the expectation.\n\nWait, the function interleave_strings(xy, abcd):\n\nxy is of length 2, abcd is 4.\n\nIn the code's process:\n\nfor i=0: append 'X' (xy[0]), then 'A' (abcd[0]): so 'XA'.\n\ni=1: 'Y' (xy[1]) added, then 'B' (abcd[1]): 'XAYB'.\n\ni=2: i < xy's len (2) \u2192 no, i is 2.\n\nso, nothing from xy. Then check second_str: i=2 <4 \u2192 'C' added. So result becomes 'XAYB' + 'C' \u2192 'XAYBC'.\n\ni=3: i >=2 for first_str. So nothing. Add 'D' from second_str: 'XAYBCD'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes, that's correct as per the example.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test: interleave_strings(\"AB\", \"XYZ\") returns 'AXBYZ'.\n\nIn code's processing:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 2.\n\ni=0: 'A' + 'X' \u2192 'AX'.\n\ni=1: 'B' + 'Y' \u2192 'AXBY'.\n\ni=2: no from first_str. 'Z' from second \u2192 'AXBYZ'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAll test cases seem to pass.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the performance, for 1e5 length, the code is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to interleave two given strings such that the characters from each string are taken alternately. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining characters from the longer string are appended to the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to interleave the characters of two strings. We take characters one by one from each string and append them to the result. If one string is exhausted before the other, the remaining characters of the longer string are appended sequentially to the result.\n\n2. **Algorithm Design**: \n   - Initialize an empty list to collect the interleaved characters.\n   - Determine the maximum length of the two strings to iterate up to that length.\n   - For each index from 0 to the maximum length minus one, append the character from the first string if it exists, followed by the character from the second string if it exists.\n   - Join the collected characters into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(max(n, m)) where n and m are the lengths of the two strings. This is because we iterate through each character up to the length of the longer string exactly once.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n + m) due to the list used to collect the result, which is then joined into a string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef interleave_strings(first_str: str, second_str: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    len1, len2 = len(first_str), len(second_str)\n    max_len = max(len1, len2)\n    for i in range(max_len):\n        if i < len1:\n            result.append(first_str[i])\n        if i < len2:\n            result.append(second_str[i])\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `result` to collect the interleaved characters.\n- **Length Calculation**: The lengths of both strings are calculated, and the maximum length is determined to handle cases where the strings are of different lengths.\n- **Loop Through Indices**: For each index from 0 to the maximum length, we check if the current index is within the bounds of each string. If it is, we append the character from that string to the result list.\n- **String Joining**: Finally, the list of characters is joined into a single string and returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the characters are interleaved efficiently and handles cases where one string is longer than the other by appending the remaining characters directly.",
