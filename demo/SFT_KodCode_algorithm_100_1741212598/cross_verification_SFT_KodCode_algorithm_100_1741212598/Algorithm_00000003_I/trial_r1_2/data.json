  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to design a function called interleave_strings that takes two strings and returns a new string where the characters are interleaved. If one string is longer, the extra part should be added at the end.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about some examples.\n\nLike the first example, \"ABCD\" and \"XY\" become \"AXBYCD\". So it's adding A and X, then B and Y, then C, then D. Oh right, because the second string is shorter, the remaining characters from the first string are appended.\n\nAnother example: when the second string is longer, like \"XY\" and \"ABCD\" give \"XAYBCD\". So the interleaving happens as much as possible, and then the rest are added.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character from both strings, taking one from each in order.\n2. Stop when one of the strings runs out of characters.\n3. Then, add the remaining part of the longer string to the result.\n\nHow to implement this efficiently?\n\nWell, since both strings can be up to 1e5 in length, I need an O(n) solution without using extra memory beyond what's necessary.\n\nI think the way to go is to take the strings as is, and for each position, take the next character if it exists in each string.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nI can create an empty list to accumulate the characters since string concatenation is expensive in Python. Lists are more efficient for appending.\n\nThen, find the minimum length of the two strings. For each index from 0 to min_length -1, I'll add the first_str[i] and then second_str[i] to the result list.\n\nAfter that, if one string is longer, I need to add all the remaining characters from the index min_length onwards.\n\nWait, but what about which one is longer? Oh right, I can take the rest of whichever string has a greater length beyond min_length. Hmm, perhaps:\n\nAfter the interleaving part, append the remaining parts.\n\nSo, after the loop, we check which string is longer. Let me get the min_length = min(len(first_str), len(second_str)). So for i < min_length, we add [first_str[i], second_str[i]]. But wait, wait! What's the order? Because in the first example, we had first_str as \"ABCD\" and second_str as \"XY\". So indexes 0: A, X. 1: B, Y. Then, for i=2, we take the first_str[2] which is C and add, but there's no second[2], so we only add C? Wait no, because min_length is 2 in this case.\n\nWait wait, for i in range(0, min_length)? Wait, if min_length is 2, indexes are 0 and 1. So after that, the remaining parts are from both strings starting from index 2.\n\nWait for \"ABCD\", length 4; \"XY\", length 2.\n\nAfter the loop (i=0 and 1), the result list has first_str[0], second[0], first_str[1], second[1] \u2192 A X B Y \u2192 so \"AXBY\". Then, we need to add the remaining of first_str, which is \"CD\", so the total is \"AXBYCD\".\n\nSo after the loop, check if len(first_str) > min_length, then add the rest. Similarly, check if len(second_str) > min_length, add the rest.\n\nWait no. Because suppose first_str is longer. So for i in 0 to min_length-1, taking characters. Then, beyond that, we have to take from first_str starting from min_length, but in the case of second_str being longer, that's already beyond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after interleaving up to min_length, we should append the remaining parts of each string.\n\nSo when interleaving, for each step beyond that, one string may have no more characters. Wait, no: without a loop for that, but after, just append the entire tail of each string beyond min_length.\n\nWait, after interleaving, we can append the parts.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Iterate to the minimum length, appending first[i], then second[i].\n- Then append the rest of first_str beyond min_length.\n- Then append the rest of second_str beyond min_length.\n\nWait, in the first case, beyond min_length, the other parts are only one string. But let's think about the case where one string is longer than the other.\n\nWait, no, because when min_length is fixed, all possible steps are considered. Wait, for example:\n\nCase 1: first_str is longer. After i reaches the length of second_str, so beyond min_length is all part of first_str.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nresult = []\nmin_len = min(len(first_str), len(second_str))\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    result.append(first_str[i])\n    result.append(second_str[i])\nif len(first_str) > min_len:\n    result.append(first_str[min_len:])\nelif len(second_str) > min_len:\n    result.append(second_str[min_len:])\n\nWait, wait no. Because after the loop, the first_str from min_len onwards is all the remaining, and the same for second_str. But wait, in the code above, I check if first is longer, add its part, else, check if second is longer, add its part. But wait, what if both are longer? Wait, no, since min_len is the minimum. So unless one is longer than the other, which is the case. So it's an else if. Any how, make sure that only the longer string is appended.\n\nWait, but in Python, you can have a condition after to append the rest.\n\nAnother approach: after interleaving, we can get the remaining of first_str and second_str beyond min_len. If any, then add them in order.\n\nBut wait, perhaps after the interleaving, each of the strings may have a remaining part. So for example, first_str is longer, then after min_len, we have first_str[i...] and also in the second_str, no parts left? Because min_len is the smaller one. So no.\n\nAh, because after min_len, one string has no remaining characters.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nif len(first_str) > min_len:\n    result += first_str[min_len:]\nelif len(second_str) > min_len:\n    result += second_str[min_len:]\n\nWait, but adding after. Like, in any case, only one or none have a remaining part.\n\nWait, let's see: suppose first_str is longer. So after the loop, we add all the remaining of first_str, from min_len... So for the first_str example, which had 4 letters and second_str had 2. After adding the first two of each, we have len 4, min_length is 2. Then, the part from first_str starting at index 2 is \"CD\". So adding that to the result.\n\nSimilarly, if second_str was longer, we get the remaining of second_str added.\n\nAnother example: first_str is 'AB' (2), second_str is 'XYZ' (3). min_len is 2. So after the loop, add [A, X, B, Y], then the remaining parts: the first_str is done, second has one more character Z (index 2) plus [\u7d22\u5f15\u6211\u597d\u50cf\u9700\u8981\u518d\u770b\uff1f\uff09\n\nThus, the code after the loop:\n\nif len(first_str) > len(second_str):\n    result += first_str[len(second_str):]\nelse:\n    result += second_str[len(first_str):]\n\nWait, because min_len is min between the two. So, for first part, your initial step is adding pairs up to min_len. Then, for the longer string, you add the remaining.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the remaining after min_len.\n\nso for example, for the strings:\n\nfirst_str is a and b, lengths. Suppose:\n\nif m is len(first_str), n is len(second_str).\n\nafter min(m, n) steps, the remaining-first is == m - min(m,n). Similarly for the second.\n\nThus, the way to get the remaining is to take [min_len:] slice of each string. But only the longer string will have non-empty [min_len:].\n\nSo in code, after the interleaving loop, the remaining part is the slice of each string beyond min_len, but only one of them will have something.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ninterleaved = []\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    interleaved.append(first_str[i])\n    interleaved.append(second_str[i])\n# Now add the remaining parts\nif len(first_str) > min_len:\n    interleaved.append(first_str[min_len:])\nelif len(second_str) > min_len:\n    interleaved.append(second_str[min_len:])\n\nWait, but wait: \"AXBYCD\" is the example. So == it's correct.\n\nAnother example: \"XY\" and \"ABCD\" is min_len(2). So after adding X, A, Y, B \u2192 \"XAYB\", then add 'CD' from first_str. So 'XAYB' + 'CD' \u2192 'XAYBCD'.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nWhat about 'AB' and 'XYZ'? min_len is 2. After A, X and B, Y are added. Then, to get 'Z' from second_str. Wait. Wait the initial loop goes i from 0 to 1. For i=0: add first[0] (A), then second[0] (X). Then i=1: add B, then Y. So the result so far is 'AXBY'. Then, 'Z' is left from the second_str.\n\nSo after the loop:\n\nlen(first_str) is 2, which is not greater than min_len (2). So check if len(second_str) > min_len (yes, since 3>2). So we append second_str[2:], which is 'Z'.\n\nThus, 'AXBY' + 'Z' \u2192 'AXBYZ'. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where both are of the same length? Like first_str and second_str are of length 3 each. min_len=3. After loop, nothing is added. Thus, all characters are interleaved.\n\nWhat about one of the strings is empty? For example, interleave_strings(\"ABC\", \"\") \u2192 should return 'ABC'. So our code should handle that.\n\nSo in the loop runs, min_len is 0. So it doesn't process any steps. Then, the remaining is added. So for first_str len is 3, which is longer than min_len (0). So add all of first_str. Correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure this in code.\n\nWe can create a list. Then, in a for loop, append the two characters per step.\n\nBut in Python, creating a list, appending, and then joining is efficient.\n\nSo:\n\ndef interleave_strings(first_str: str, second_str: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    min_len = min(len(first_str), len(second_str))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        result.append(first_str[i])\n        result.append(second_str[i])\n    if len(first_str) > min_len:\n        result.append(first_str[min_len:])\n    elif len(second_str) > min_len:\n        result.append(second_str[min_len:])\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nWait, wait: but in the for loop, for each i, we are taking first_str[i], then second_str[i]. But wait, in the first example, \"ABCD\" and \"XY\", the interleaving is AXBYCD. So that would be the first two characters from each string being interleaved. But the code appends all even steps:\n\ni=0: A and X\ni=1: B and Y\nso after the loop, the result is [A, X, B, Y], which we will then add first_str[2:4], which is 'CD'. So the total becomes 'AXBYCD'. Correct.\n\nAnother example: interleave \"ABCD\" (len 4) and \"XY\" (len 2) \u2192 min_len 2. Then, 'CD' is added.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nAnother test case: interleave(\"XY\", \"ABCD\") \u2192 lenoxy is 2, min is 2. Thus, after the loop: X and A \u2192 i=0; Y and B \u2192 i=1. So ['X','A','Y','B'] \u2192 then append the rest of first_str which is 'CD'? No, wait. No, wait: first_str is 'XY', second_str is 'ABCD' len 4. So in the loop, i=0 \u2192 X then A; i=1 \u2192 Y then B. So the result list is ['X','A','Y','B']. Then, the remaining part is of the second_str. Because len(first_str)=2, which is not more than min_len 2. Wait, wait no. Wait, first_str is 'XY' (length 2), min_len is 2. After the loop, the loop runs i=0 and 1, processing each.\n\nThen, len(first_str) is 2, which is less than or equal to min_len (2). So in code, it's else statement: check if second_str's len is greater than min_len. len(second_str) is 4>2. So we add second_str[2...3]: 'CD'. Thus, the result becomes X,A,Y,B,CD \u2192 'XAYBCD' which is correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, test case: interleave \"AB\", \"XYZ\". min_len 2. So in loop: A,X \u2192 B,Y. So result so far is A X B Y \u2192 list is [A, X, B, Y]. then, check: len(first_str)=2 = min_len, len(second_str) is 3>2, so take second_str[2:], which is Z. So add it to get 'AXBYZ'.\n\nThus, code seems correct.\n\nWhat about the case where one string is empty. For example, interleave 'ABC', ''. Then, min_len is 0, loop doesn't run. Then, len(first_str) is 3>0, so add [ABC]. So result is 'ABC'.\n\nWhat about interleave('A', 'BCD').\n\nLoop runs for i=0 \u2192 'A' and 'B'. Then, first_str len is 1, which is min_len=1. So code proceeds to add the remaining of second_str: 'CD' (since len(second_str) is 3>1). So the result is 'AB' + 'CD' \u2192 'ABCD'?\n\nWait, no. Wait the loop runs for i=0: first_str[0] is 'A', and second_str[0] is 'B', so result is ['A', 'B']. Then, after loop, len(first_str) is 1 not greater than 1. So check if second_str is longer. yes, 3 > 1. So add second_str[1:], which is 'CD'. So the result list is [A, B, 'CDE']? No: 'BCDEF', wait no, what's the String slicing?\n\nWait, for second_str = 'BCD' \u2192 index starts at 0 (B is 0, C is 1, D is 2). min_len 1 \u2192 from first string, len is 1. So in the code:\n\nlen(first_str) is 1, not greater than min_len. So in the 'elif' condition: check if len(second_str) > min_len (1), which is 3>1. So 'BCD' is length 3, min is 1. So we add second_str[1:] which is 'CD'.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in the code, for the example 'A' and 'BCD':\n\nAfter the loop, the result list is ['A', 'B'].\n\nThen, we execute the 'elif' because len(second_str) > min_len (3 >1). So 'elif' condition is true. So we append second_str[min_len:] \u2192 which is 'BCD'[1:] \u2192 'CD'.\n\nSo the result list becomes ['A','B', 'CD'], which when joined becomes 'ABCD'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: the interleaving is 'AB' \u2192 because i=0, take first_str[0] and second_str[0] which is 'A' and 'B' \u2192 after that, we add the remaining of the second_str beyond i=1. So the result is 'AB' + 'CD' \u2192 which is 'ABCD'. But wait, the expected interleaving is when one string is longer, the remaining is added in the order. So in this example, it's correct.\n\nWhat about another example: interleaving 'AB' and 'XY' \u2192 len both 2. So loop runs for 2 steps. i=0: 'A','X' and i=1: 'B','Y' \u2192 so the result is 'AXBY'.\n\nIt works.\n\nWhat about when one string is longer by more than one character?\n\nFor example: interleave 'A', 'X') \u2192 'AX'. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nThus, the code should work for all cases.\n\nNow, considering the performance constraints: the function must handle up to 1e5 length strings in one second.\n\nCreating a list and appending individual characters is O(n), which should be manageable.\n\nBut, what about the '.append()' calls in the loop. Since each character is added with an O(1) average-case append (but in the worst case, the list may need to be expanded, which could take O(n) time. However, for 1e5 steps, Python's list is optimized, so it should handle it.\n\nAnother approach to improve performance is to pre-calculate the list sizes and not have multiple appends.\n\nWait, but in Python, appending to lists in a loop is very efficient.\n\nBut perhaps, for the loops, since each iteration appends two elements, the list will have 2*min_len elements after loop. But in Python, the += operator for adding a list to another can be done efficiently, e.g. result += [a, b], but perhaps using list.extend is slightly faster. However, in our code, it's more efficient to append in that way because each is a separate step.\n\nWait, no. Because in each loop we are appending two individual elements.\n\nYes, but the total number of operations is 2 * min_len. Which is 2e5 steps at maximum. That's acceptable.\n\nThen, in the worst case, after the initial loop, the code appends a string of 1e5 characters in a single operation.\n\nWhich is also acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should meet the performance requirements.\n\nSo the function should be:\n\nImplement as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a function that interleaves two given strings. The function should handle cases where the strings are of different lengths by appending the remaining characters of the longer string after interleaving the characters up to the length of the shorter string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Interleave Characters**: Iterate through each character of both strings up to the length of the shorter string, appending characters from each string alternately to the result list.\n2. **Append Remaining Characters**: After interleaving up to the length of the shorter string, check if one of the strings is longer. If so, append the remaining characters of the longer string to the result list.\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach ensures that each character is processed exactly once, making the solution efficient with a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef interleave_strings(first_str: str, second_str: str) -> str:\n    result = []\n    min_len = min(len(first_str), len(second_str))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        result.append(first_str[i])\n        result.append(second_str[i])\n    if len(first_str) > min_len:\n        result.append(first_str[min_len:])\n    elif len(second_str) > min_len:\n        result.append(second_str[min_len:])\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `result` to accumulate the interleaved characters.\n2. **Interleaving Loop**: We determine the minimum length of the two strings, `min_len`, and iterate up to this length. For each index `i`, we append the character from `first_str` at index `i` followed by the character from `second_str` at index `i` to the result list.\n3. **Appending Remaining Characters**: After the loop, we check if either string has remaining characters beyond `min_len`. If so, we append these remaining characters to the result list.\n4. **Join and Return**: Finally, we join the characters in the result list into a single string and return it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently interleave the characters and handle cases where one string is longer than the other, all while maintaining a linear time complexity.",
