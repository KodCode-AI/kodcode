  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called find_next_power_of_two that takes a non-negative integer and returns the smallest power of two greater than the given number. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, first, what is a power of two? Powers of two are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. Each is 2 raised to an integer power. So, 2^0 is 1, 2^1 is 2, etc.\n\nThe function should find the next power of two that's bigger than the input number. For example, if the input is 15, it should return 16. If it's 16, it returns 32.\n\nWhat about edge cases? The problem says if the input is 0, we return 1. Because 1 is the first power of two greater than 0. And if the input is exactly a power of two, like 1, we return the next one which is 2.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. If the input number is 0, return 1.\n2. For other numbers, find the smallest power of two that's larger than the number.\n\nWait, let me think about how to find this power. One approach is to find the exponent that would give a power just above the number.\n\nFor example, let's take number=15. The log base 2 of 15 is about 3.906. So the next integer is 4, and 2^4 is 16. For number=16, log2 is exactly 4, so next is 5, 2^5 is 32.\n\nAnother approach is to handle this using bitwise operations because powers of two have exactly one bit set in their binary representation.\n\nHmm, how does that work? Let's recall that in binary, a power of two is represented as 1 followed by any number of zeros. So, for number n, if it's between 2^k and 2^(k+1)-1, then 2^(k+1) is the next power.\n\nWait, the way to find the next power is to find the position of the leftmost set bit in the number and then shift one more bit.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in some programming problems, the next power can be found by using bitwise operations.\n\nWait, let's think about numbers that are not powers of two. For example, 15 is 1111. The next power is 16 (10000). 16 is a power of two, so the next is 32.\n\nWait, maybe using log2 is the straightforward approach.\n\nIn Python, we can calculate the logarithm base 2 of the number, take the ceiling, then 2 raised to that.\n\nBut wait, math.log2 might have some edge cases when the number is exactly a power of two. Let's see.\n\nFor example, number=16, log2(16)=4.0. Ceiling is 4. So 2^4 is 16, but we need the next one, which is 32. So perhaps adding one to the exponent even if it's a power would give the next one.\n\nWait, wait. Because, the function must return a power larger than the input. So, for an input which is exactly a power of two, we need to return the next one.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is: calculate the exponent as the floor of log2(number) and then the next power is 2^(exponent+1). Hmm, no.\n\nWait, for number=1, log2(1)=0. The next power is 2, which is 2^(1) = 2. For number=15, log2 is ~3.906, floor is 3, so 2^4 is 16. That's correct. For number=16, log2 is 4, so exponent +1 is 5, 2^5 is 32.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the algorithm could be:\n\n- if number == 0: return 1\n- else:\n    - take the log2(number)\n    - floor it to get exponent\n    - compute 2^(exponent + 1)\nBut wait, let me think about number=2.\n\nnumber=2 is a power of two (2^1). So its next should be 4. Let's see: log2(2) is 1.0, floor is 1, 2^(2) is 4. Correct.\n\nBut let's also think about cases where number is 0. Because 2^0 is 1. So 0 returns 1.\n\nSo, implementing that.\n\nHowever, using log2 might not be the most efficient method, especially for very large numbers, but for an interview, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, another approach using bitwise operations.\n\nLet me think: for a number n > 0.\n\nCompute the bitwise OR of n and n-1. Then, adding 1 and shifting right appropriate times. Wait, perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nFor example, to compute the next power of two, we can do:\n\n1. Compute the bitwise complement of n and add 1.\nWait, I'm not too sure.\n\nAlternatively, a common method for finding the next power of two is:\n\nint nextPowerOfTwo(int n) {\n    n |= n >> 1;\n    n |= n >> 2;\n    n |= n >> 4;\n    n |= n >> 8;\n    n |= n >> 16;\n    return n + 1;\n}\n\nWait, but does that give the next power? Hmm. Wait, let's test this.\n\nWait, let me test n=15 (0b1111).\n\nn |= n >>1: 0b1111 | 0b0111 = 0b1111.\n\nSimilarly, n is still 15 after all the or operations.\n\nAdding 1 gives 16. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about n=16 (10000). \n\nAfter the or operations, the result is: n | (n >>1 is 10000 >>1 is 1000, which is 8 in decimal). So OR 16 | 8: but wait, 16 is 10000, OR 01000 is 11000 (24). Then with the shift by 2, 11000 | 00100 (6) is 11100 (28). Shift 4: 11100 | 0000 is 11100. Similarly with shift 8 and 16, no change. Then add 1: 28 +1=29? No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait the function I described sets all bits below the highest set bit in n, then adds 1, which gives next power. But wait, in the case where n is exactly a power of two, such as 8 (1000), then the function gives 15 +1=16? Or first 15 comes when we perform ORs on 8.\n\nWait, n=8.\n\nn is 1000.\n\nAfter first OR (n = n | (n>>1)): 1000 | 0100 (since 8>>1 is 4, 0100) = 1100.\n\nThen next OR with (n>>2): n is 1100 | 0011 (3) becomes 1111 (15). Then OR with (n>>4) and higher shifts have no effect.\n\nSo, n after all ORs is 15, add 1 gives 16.\n\nWhich is correct. So for n=16, what's the process?\n\nn=16: 10000 in binary.\n\nn |= (n >>1) is 10000 | 1000 (16 | 8) is 11000 (24).\n\nThen n |= (n >>2) is 11000 | 00100 (4) is 11100 (28).\n\nn |= (n >>4): 11100 | 00000 (since 28 >>4 is 1 (binary 11100 >>4 is 00111, but wait 28 is 11100, which is 4 bits after the highest set bit. Wait, 16 is 5 bits. Hmm, perhaps it's better to see in code.\n\nWait, when you do n |= n >> 8, for n=16 (10000), n>>8 is 0 (if dealing with 32-bit integers), so no change.\n\nSimilarly, n |= n >>16 also 0.\n\nSo after all or steps, n=28 (11100). Add 1, becomes 11101, which is 29, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that's an issue because 16's next power of two is 32.\n\nWait, that suggests that this method doesn't work correctly for n being a power of two. So perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, this method gives the next power which is one more than the current, except when the current is a power of two.\n\nSo maybe the function needs adjustment.\n\nSo perhaps the method is correct when n is not zero and not a power of two. But when n is a power of two, it returns n's next power.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, when n is power of two, for example n=16 (binary 10000). According to the method:\n\nn |= n>>1 \u2192 10000 | 1000 \u2192 11000 (24).\n\nThen n |=n >>2 \u2192 11000 | 00100 \u2192 11100 (28).\n\nn |= n >>4: 11100 | 00001 for 32 bit (no, because n>>4 for 28 is 11100 >>4 is 111, which is 7, which ORed with 11100 will be 11100 | 00111 is 11111 (31 in decimal).\n\nWait, wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, 28 is 11100 in binary. Let's break down each step:\n\nn = 16 (binary 10000).\n\nn |= n >> 1: 10000 | 01000 \u2192 11000 (24).\n\nn |= n >> 2: 11000 | 00100 \u2192 11100 (28).\n\nn |= n >>4: 11100 (binary) >>4 is 111 (since 11100 is 28, 28/16 is 1 with remainder 12, so the higher bits become 1 when shifted right). So 28 >>4 is 1 (0001?), wait no.\n\nWait, 28's binary is 11100. When we right shift by 4 positions, it would become 11100 >>4 \u2192 111, but in 4 shifts.\n\nWait, wait: 11100 is a 5-bit number. Shifting right 4 bits would get 1.\n\nSo 11100 >>4 is 00001 (if we have 5-bit numbers). So OR with that:\n\n11100 | 00001 = 11101 (29).\n\nn now is 29.\n\nThen, the function adds 1 to get 30.\n\nWait, 30 is 11110, which is not a power of two. So this method doesn't work when the input is a power of two.\n\nHmm, so that approach might not be reliable.\n\nWait, but another way: perhaps after performing n |= n >> 1 etc., the result is the next power of two's minus one.\n\nSo in the case of n=16, after OR steps, is it 31? No. Because above explanation gave 30.\n\nHmm, maybe my initial understanding of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, I should think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to find the position of the most significant bit (MSB) that is set in the number. The next power is 2^(msb_position + 1).\n\nBut how to find the position of the MSB in Python.\n\nPython has a function bit_length() for integers. So, for example, number=15 is 1111 which has a bit_length of 4. So 2^4 is 16.\n\nFor number=16, bit_length is 5 (since it's 10000, requires 5 bits). Wait no: 16 is 10000 which is 5 bits. So, number=16, bit_length() returns 5. Then 2^(5) is 32.\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\nnumber =0: bit_length is 0. Which is handled specially.\n\nnumber=1: bit_length is 1. So 2^1=2, but since the function returns the next power after the input, which is 2.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nn | bit_length | next power\n0 | 0 \u2192 return 1 (2^0 is 1)\n1 \u219216 \u21921: next is 2^1=2\n15 \u21924 bits\u2192 next is 2^4=16.\n16\u21925 bits\u2192 next is 2^5=32.\n\nYes! So this logic seems solid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nif number is 0 \u2192 return 1.\n\nelse:\n\n    exponent = number.bit_length()\n\n    next_power = 1 << exponent  # which is 2^exponent\n\nBut wait, what if number is exactly a power of two? Let's take n=8 (bit_length is 4, because 8 is 1000 requires 4 bits). 1<<4 is 16, which is the next power after 8, correct.\n\nWait, wait: 1 bit shifted left 3 times is 8 (2^3). But the bit_length of 8 is 4, because 8 in binary is '1000', which requires 4 bits (the leading 1 and then three zeros). So for 8, the exponent is 3 (since 2^3=8), but number.bit_length() is 4. So 1<<4 is 16, which is correct because the function must return 16 (the next power after 8 is 16). So the approach works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nif number ==0: return 1\n\nelse:\n\n   exponent = (number.bit_length())\n\n   return 1 << exponent\n\nBut wait, testing the examples given:\n\nSample 1: find_next_power_of_two(0) \u2192 1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: find_next_power_of_two(1) \u2192 10=2.\n\nSample 3: find_next_power_of_two(15) \u219216.\n\nSample4: find_next_power_of_two(16) \u219232.\n\nTesting number=2:\n\nbit_length is 2: 1<<2=4, correct.\n\nAnother test: number=3; bit_length=2 \u21924. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about number=4: 100, bit_length=3 \u21921<<3=8. Correct.\n\nWhat about number=5: bit_length=3 \u21928.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, let me think more carefully:\n\nWait, what about number=7: bit_length is 3. So 8, which is correct.\n\nSo, seems that this method works.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nif number is 0, return 1.\n\nelse:\n\n   return 1 << number.bit_length()\n\nBut wait, let's also handle number=0.\n\nPutting it together:\n\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    if number ==0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 1 << number.bit_length()\n    \nWait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait wait, let me test for number=0.\n\nYes, returns 1.\n\nAnother test: number=1 \u21921 bit_length() is 1 \u21921<<1=2. Correct.\n\nNumber=15 \u2192bit_length() is 4 \u219216. Correct.\n\nNumber=16: bit_length() is 5 \u219232. Correct.\n\nWhat about number=63 (111111 in binary, which is 6 bits). So 1<<6 is 64. Correct.\n\nNumber=64 \u21927 bits, 1<<7=128. Correct.\n\nWhat about number=255 \u2192 bit_length is 8, so 256. Correct.\n\nYes, this approach seems to work.\n\nBut wait, when will the bit_length fail? Let me think of a case.\n\nHmm, perhaps for number=1: works correctly.\n\nDoes it handle zero correctly?\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach requires handling number=0 as a special case and then using bit_length and shifting.\n\nSo the function is simple.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nFirst, the function has a docstring given, so I can include that.\n\nHandle number=0: return 1.\n\nElse, return 1 << (number.bit_length())\n\nBut wait, for number=1: bit_length() is 1, 1 <<1 is 2.\n\nYes, that matches expectations.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nSample tests:\n\nfind_next_power_of_two(0) \u21921. Correct.\n\nfind_next_power_of_two(1) \u21922. Correct.\n\nfind_next_power_of_two(15) \u219216. Correct.\n\nfind_next_power_of_two(16) \u219232. Correct.\n\nGreat.\n\nThus, the Python function is as I wrote above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest power of two that is greater than a given non-negative integer. If the input is 0, the result should be 1. For any other input, the result should be the next power of two greater than the input number.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently involves understanding the properties of powers of two and using bitwise operations to determine the next power of two. Here\u2019s the detailed approach:\n\n1. **Special Case for Zero**: If the input number is 0, the smallest power of two greater than 0 is 1.\n2. **Bit Length Calculation**: For any non-zero input, the next power of two can be determined using the `bit_length()` method of Python integers. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary. Subtracting 1 from this value gives the position of the highest set bit, but in our case, we directly use the bit length to compute the next power of two.\n3. **Bitwise Shift**: Using the bit length, we compute the next power of two by left-shifting 1 by the bit length. This effectively calculates 2 raised to the power of the bit length, which is the next power of two greater than the input number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_next_power_of_two(number: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the smallest power of two greater than the given non-negative integer.\n    If the input is 0, returns 1.\n    >>> find_next_power_of_two(0) == 1\n    >>> find_next_power_of_two(1) == 2\n    >>> find_next_power_of_two(15) == 16\n    >>> find_next_power_of_two(16) == 32\n    \"\"\"\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    return 1 << number.bit_length()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input number is 0. If it is, the function returns 1 immediately.\n2. **Bit Length Calculation**: For non-zero inputs, the function calculates the bit length of the number. This bit length directly gives the position of the highest bit plus one, which is used to compute the next power of two.\n3. **Bitwise Shift**: The next power of two is found by left-shifting 1 by the bit length of the number. This operation effectively computes 2 raised to the power of the bit length, ensuring the result is the smallest power of two greater than the input.\n\nThis approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) since both the bit length calculation and bitwise shift operations are constant-time operations in Python.",
