  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called two_sum_indices that takes a list of integers, nums, and a target integer, and returns a list of two indices whose corresponding values add up to the target. If there are no such pair, it should return an empty list. \n\nThe problem says to use the two-pointer technique. Hmm, wait, I remember that two-pointer is usually used when the array is sorted because that allows you to start with the smallest and largest elements and adjust based on the sum. So the first thing I think is, should I sort the array? Or can I apply two-pointer without sorting?\n\nLet me look at the examples provided. Oh wait, in the first example, two_sum_indices([2,7,11,15],9) returns [0,1] which is 2 +7. So the array is sorted. Another example: two_sum_indices([3*i for i in range(10)], 19). Oh wait, that's [0,1,2,...9] multiplied by 3, so the array is [0,3,6,...27], which is also sorted. So perhaps the function expects that the input list is already sorted. Or maybe it's intended for the two-pointer approach which requires a sorted list. But wait, wait, the examples may not be entirely sorted. Like the one [1,3,3], which is sorted, but after that, [3*i for I in range(10)] is sorted, yes.\n\nWait, but if the function is supposed to work without the list being sorted, then using two-pointer might not work. Alternatively, maybe the function expects the list to be sorted, but the function doesn't sort it itself.\n\nWait, let me think again: The two-pointer technique is efficient for two-sum when the list is sorted and each element appears only once, or when duplicates are considered.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is to sort the list, but then that changes the indices. Or wait, but then the indices would not correspond to the original list's indices because after sorting, the order changes. Oh right, that's a problem. Because the function needs to return the indices of the original nums list, the two-pointer approach can't be directly applied since after sorting the list, the indices would have changed.\n\nHmm, then maybe the two-pointer approach is not suitable. Unless I can find a way to track the original indices. Alternatively, perhaps the two-pointer approach is used in the context of the list being unsorted, but that doesn't make sense because the two pointers would have to move through the array in a way that each step is informed by the previous sums.\n\nWait, the examples provided seem to suggest that the function expects the input list to be in a certain order. Wait, no\u2014 the function needs to handle any list, not necessarily sorted.\n\nSo then, perhaps the two-pointer approach isn't the way to go unless the list is first sorted, but that would cause the indices to change. Hmm, conflicting thoughts here.\n\nWait, maybe the function is intended to use the two-pointer technique on a sorted array of (value, index) pairs. Like, break down the approach into steps: \n\n1. Keep track of each element's value and its index in a list of tuples.\n2. Sort this list based on the values.\n3. Then apply two-pointer on this sorted list of tuples to find a pair whose sum equals the target.\n4. Once such a pair is found, return the indices in a sorted order.\n\nBut wait, if the function's output doesn't require the indices to be in a specific order, like [0,3] could be [3,0], but looking at the examples, the first example is [0,1], which are the first and third indices. Wait, no\u2014 in the first sample, the nums are [2,7,11,15], target 9. 2+7 is 9, and their indices are 0 and 1, so output is [0,1]. So the output is in the order they appear in the original list.\n\nBut if you sort the list, the tuple would be sorted by values, so the original indices may end up in any order. So if after sorting, the two pointers (left and right) could point to elements with smaller and larger values, but the index order might not matter as long as the correct two are found.\n\nBut when building the result list, do I sort those indices? Looking at the sample: when the target is 17, the pair is 2 and15 which are indices 0 and 3. So output is [0,3]. If the tuple list is sorted, the two would be 2 (index 0) and 15 (index3), found as a sum.\n\nWait, so in the tuple list after sorting, the [2,7,11,15] would be [(2,0), (7,1), (11,2), (15,3)]. So applying two-pointer, left starts at 0, right at 3, sum is 17. So yes, the pair is 0 and3, which the sample expects.\n\nIn another example: two_sum_indices([3*i for i in range(10)], 19). The list is [0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27]. The target is 19. So what's 19? 19 needs to be formed by two numbers. The possible pairs are 0+19 (but 19 is not present), 1+18 (but 1 is not present, but 0 + ... no. Wait the list is 0,3,6, etc.\u2014 so 0+18 would be 18, which is part of the list (index6, value18). So the sum needed is 19. 0 +19 no. So in the array, 0,3,6,9, etc. So to get 19: 0 + (19-0)=19, which is 19. So 19 is beyond 27? No; 19 is part of the list at index 6 (3*6=18? Wait no: 3*6=18, yes, but that's 18. So for target 19, do any two elements add to it? Let's see:\n\n3* i (i from 0-9): numbers are 0,3,6,...27.\n\nLooking for two numbers adding to 19: 0+19? Well 19 is in the list: Wait 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27. So 1 is not part of it, but 19 isn't in here. So what about 6+13: 13 isn't there. 3+16? Not present. 9+10? No. So no pair adds to 19. Hence the function returns an empty list.\n\nSo in this case, two-pointer approach would not find any pair, hence correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,3], target 6. So the function returns [1,2]. Because 3 +3 =6, and their indices are 1 and2.\n\nSo in this list, using two-pointer approach, after making a sorted list of tuples: the tuples would be [(1,0), (3,1), (3,2)], and summing 3 and3 gets to 6. So left pointer starts at 0, right at 2. sum is 1+3[2] (1+3 is 4, which is less than 6). So move the left up. Then left is at 1, value3. right is at 2, value3. Sum is 6, so found the pair. So the indices are 1 and 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Create a list of tuples containing (value, original index) for each element in nums.\n\n- Sort this list of tuples based on the value.\n\n- Apply two-pointer approach: left at 0, right at len(tuples)-1.\n\n- For each step, calculate the sum of tuples[left] and tuples[right].\n\n- If sum is less than target: move left pointer right.\n\n- If sum is more than target: move right pointer left.\n\n- If sum equals target: return the sorted (tuples' indices) as the pair.\n\nWait, but the indices that the function returns should be in the original array's indices, but after the two-pointer approach, we have to get the tuple's original indices and return them as a list, sorted?\n\nWait no: because the two-pointer approach in the sorted list might find any order of pairs, but what about the ordered indices? Do the function expect the two indices to be in a specific order?\n\nLooking at the samples, for example:\n\nSample 1: [2,7,11,15], target 9. The function returns [0,1], which is the lower index first.\n\nIf after the two-pointer approach, the pair's original indices are, say, 3 and 0, then the function would return [0,3], as the sample when target is 17.\n\nSo the function expects the indices in the output list to be in order, but the order is such that the first index is the one that appeared earlier in the original list. Wait, no. Let me see: in the sample, [2,7,11,15], target 9, output is [0,1]. Those are the correct indices in order. For [3*i for I in [0-9]], target 19, returns empty.\n\nAnother sample: [2,7,11,15], target 17, which sum is 2+15=17, indices 0 and3, output is [0,3]. So the function outputs the indices in the order they are found, but after which sorting? Because if you imagine two pointers meeting in the middle and the indices could be in any order, how does the function return them? Or does the function need to return the indices in the order of their occurrence, or as a sorted pair. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the sample when the function returns [1,2], which is the pair 7 is at index1, 11 is index2, the sum is18 in that case\u2014 wait no: no, wait 7 +11 is 18, which is in one sample. Or wait. Wait perhaps I need to return the pair as the two indices, but the order might not matter. But the function returns [1,2], so perhaps according to the original array's indices' order, which is 1 and2.\n\nSo the conclusion is: after using the two-pointer approach and finding the pair, the function should return the two indices as they are in the original array. But when two-pointer points to the two elements, the indices may not be in order. So after getting the two indices, I should check which one is smaller and order them accordingly, or should it not matter as per the samples.\n\nBut looking at the sample where the two indices are 1 and2, the function returns [1,2], which is the correct order.\n\nSo perhaps, when I get the two tuples from the left and right pointers after moving, their original indices can be in any order. Therefore, when returning, I need to return them in a list with the smaller index first.\n\nBecause, for example, in the pair (0,3), 0 is smaller than3, so the list is [0,3]; in the pair (1,3), it's [1,3].\n\nBut looking at the sample when target is 18: which is 7 +11 =18. So in the sorted list, the starting left would be 0 (value2), right at3 (15): sum 2+15=17<18. So move left to 1 (7). 7+15=22>18, so move right to2 (11). 7+11=18 yes. So the tuples are (7,1) and (11,2). So their original indices are1 and2. So the function returns [1,2], which is the correct output.\n\nSo when the sum is found, I have the two tuples. I add their indices to a list, and return them in a sorted order (the smaller index comes first).\n\nAlternatively, no\u2014 if the function is supposed to return the two indices in the order they were found, but in the first sample, it's [0,1], which is correct because 0 comes before1 in the original array.\n\nBut in the [1,3,3] target6, the function returns [1,2], which matches the found indices.\n\nWait, perhaps the function can return the pair in any order, but in the samples, it's the expected order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should return the two indices in the order they appear in the original array. For example, in the first sample, the left pointer found index0, then the right pointer found index1, but that's not correct because in the two-pointer approach for [2,7,11,15], to find sum9, the two elements are 2 and7: which are at 0 and1, respectively. So yes, in the two-pointer approach, the left is 0, right is1. So I think, once a pair is found via two-pointer, the function can simply return the two indices in whatever order they're found (left's index and the right's index). But wait, in the sample with [2,7,11,15], target9, the sum is found when left is at 0 and right is at1, since 2+7=9. So their indices are 0 and1, which is exactly the sample's output.\n\nSo, I think that after finding the pair, the function can return the two indices in a list in the order they are found. But wait, for the same example, if the list were different\u2014 say, a list where the two-pointer approach picks an index that's higher than the other, would the function return [high, low] or [low, high]? \n\nSo to make sure, in the sample where the function returns [0,3], the left is at0, right is3. So the indices are 0 and3, so the output is [0,3], which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps, when a pair is found, the function should return the two indices in the order of their positions in the list\u2014 whatever that order is. But to ensure that the output is in a particular order (like lower index first), perhaps I should sort them before returning.\n\nBut let's look at the sample [1,3,3], target6. The two-pointer approach would have the two tuples in the list sorted as (1,0), (3,1), (3,2), so left is at0 (value1), right at2 (value3). Their sum is 4, which is <6, so move left to1 (value3). Now, sum is 3+3=6, so the indices are1 and2. So the output is [1,2], which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the two indices are found as1 and2, returned as [1,2].\n\nBut suppose the original tuple list was constructed such that the left pointer is at a higher index than the right. Would that happen? Wait, the left pointer starts at0 (smallest value), and the right starts at the end (largest value). So for sum= target, the left's index in the tuple is for the smaller value, right's is for the larger.\n\nTherefore, when the two are found, left's original index may or may not be less than the right's. So for example, if the original array is [3,2,4], and tuples are sorted as (2,1), (3,0), (4,2). So if target is5, the sum of 2+3=5, indexes are1 and0. So in the function, when found, left is at0 (tuple (2,1)), right is at1 (tuple (3,0)). So the indices found are1 and0. The function needs to return [0,1], ordered in the way they appear in the original array. Oh wait no\u2014 because the function's output expects 0 and1 in this case.\n\nSo in that scenario, the function would have to return the two indices, sorted in the output list.\n\nWait, what's [x, y] when x and y are the indices. Suppose x is larger than y; then the output can't be [x, y] if it's supposed to be [y, x]. Because in the first sample, the output is [0,1], which is the correct order of indices.\n\nTherefore, to generate the correct output, after finding the two indices, arrange them in the order they appear in the original array\u2014 or perhaps, simply sort the indices before adding to the result. So in the pair found, after getting the two indices, do something like result = sorted([a, b]) and return that.\n\nLooking at the first sample: returns [0,1], which is [0,1] when sorted.\n\nIn the [3,2,4] example, after finding the two indices as (1,3) and (0,3) if the sum is5: wait no, let me correct.\n\nWait the array [3,2,4], in sorted tuple list is [(2,1), (3,0), (4,2)]. For target5, in the two-pointer approach: left is0 (2), right is1 (3). sum is5. So the indices are1 and0. So the function should return [0,1], because that's their order in the original array. But how is that possible? Because the tuple returns (tuple1, tuple2) where the indices are1 and0.\n\nSo when we get [1,0], we should sort them and return [0,1]. \n\nSo that seems to make sense. Hence, once the two-pointer finds a pair, the function should return the two indices sorted in ascending order.\n\nBut let's see: Suppose the array is [2, 7, 11,15]. For target9, the pair is 0 and1, which after sorting remain [0,1], correct.\n\nAnother case: indices 3 and0, as in [3,2,4], the sorted indices are [0,3].\n\nWait, wait, wait, the array [3,2,4] has indices0:3, index1:2, index2:4.\n\nWhen considering the tuples sorted as [(2,1), (3,0), (4,2)].\n\nWait, if the target is 5: 2 (index1) +3 (index0) =5. So the two indices in the tuple pair are0 and1. Wait, the tuples are (2,1) and (3,0).\n\nSo the two indices from the tuples are1 and0. So when sorted, they [0,1]. So the function would return [0,1].\n\nSo the two-pointer approach would find the indices1 and0, but when returned, they would be in order as[0,1]. So yes, that makes the output correct.\n\nHence, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a list of tuples, each containing the value and the original index of nums.\n\n2. Sort this list of tuples by the value.\n\n3. Apply two-pointer technique:\n\n   a. Initialize left to0, right to len(tuples)-1.\n\n   b. Loop:\n\n   - if left >= right: break loop.\n\n   - Compute sum of current left and right values.\n\n   - if sum == target:\n\n     - return the sorted list of the two indices from the tuples.\n\n   - elif sum < target: move left pointer to left+1.\n\n   - else: move right pointer to right-1.\n\n4. If the loop completes without finding a pair, return an empty list.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the same sum can be achieved by multiple pairs. But the function's samples only return the first possible pair?\n\nLooking at the sample where nums = [1,3,3], target6: the pair is1 and2, which in the tuple list are (3,1) and (3,2). So returns [1,2].\n\nWait, another possible pair in the tuple list: (3,0) (if there is a 3 at index0) and (3,1) for a sum. But in this example, it's [1,3,3], so original index0 is1, but that can't be paired with any previous 3. Because 1's only pairing is with the other 3's.\n\nSo two-pointer approach for sorted list will find all possible pairs, but which one?\n\nWell, since in the two-pointer approach, when the sum is found, it will return the first possible pair. But wait, what if the list has duplicate pairs? Let's see.\n\nBut for [3,3,3], if the target is6: the possible pairs are (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). Two-pointer will start at0 and2. sum3+3=6. So returns [0,2], which when sorted is[0,2].\n\nSo the function will return [0,2] is one of the possible correct answers. Is that correct? Since the function expects a pair that adds up to the target regardless of order.\n\nSo the function is supposed to return the correct indices regardless of which pair is found first as long as it's valid.\n\nHence, the approach should work.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, let's outline the code:\n\n- Take nums and target as inputs.\n\n- Create a list of tuples, each tuple is (value, index).\n\n- Sort this list based on the value.\n\n- Initialize left=0, right = len(tuples) -1.\n\n- while left < right:\n\n   - current_sum = tuples[left][0] + tuples[right][0]\n\n   - if current_sum == target:\n\n      - collect the indices as [tuples[left][1], tuples[right][1]]\n\n      - sort the indices\n\n      - return the sorted list.\n\n   - elif current_sum < target: left +=1\n\n   - else: right -=1\n\n- After the loop, return empty list.\n\nNow, but wait, the list of tuples must be sorted in such a way that the two-pointer approach correctly finds any pair. What if there are multiple possible pairs? For example, what if [x, y, x] is present, and the target is 2x. Then the two possible pairs are (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nThe two-pointer approach may not find all possible. It would find x from left as the first x, and then x from right as the last x. But how sure are we that this pair is correct according to the original array.\n\nWait, no: the two-pointer approach, when the sum is equal, will return the first possible pair it finds. So in the case where the tuple list is sorted by value, the first pair found is the earliest in the tuple list. But perhaps, other pairs may have smaller or larger indices.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nnums = [3, 3, 3], target=6. The tuple list is [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)].\n\nThe two-pointer would pick left at0, right at2. sum is3+3=6, so the pair is (0,2). When sorted, returns [0,2]. But the correct pairs are (0,1), (0,2), and(1,2). Why is this function returning [0,2]? Because the two-pointer approach would have left=0 and right=2. Is the function supposed to return any correct pair? Because the problem's examples do not have multiple possible pairs except for the 1,3,3 example which returns (1,2) as the correct indices.\n\nWait, I think the function is correct as long as it returns any correct pair, not necessarily all. Because in the example, the pair (1 and2) is correct, and returns it. Similarly, in the case of multiple pairs, two-pointer will find the first one possible. But for some cases, perhaps it may miss the pair. For example, if the list has tuples where the early elements do not form pairs but later elements do.\n\nLike nums = [1, 4, 2, 3], target5. Which numbers are? 2 and3 are 5, but in the tuple list, which is sorted as [(1,0), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1)]. Then target is5, which would be 2+3. Left is0 (1), right is3 (4): sum5, which is5. So the indices would be (0) and (3) (since tuples[left] is1, index0; tuples[right] is4, index1). 1+4=5. So the function returns [0,1]. But the correct indices are2 and3, whose 2+3 equals5. So function returns the wrong pair.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in this case, two-pointer found a different pair than expected. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, because after sorting the tuple list, the pair 2 and3 is appearing at indexes2 and3 in the tuple list. But, the two pointers start at0 and3, sum 1+4=5. So the function would return the pair of indices0 and1, which are the indices for1 and4, which sum to5. So the function would return [0,1], which is correct according to the function's rules, but may have another possible correct pair of indices according to the problem.\n\nBut in the problem statement, which of these pairs is correct?\n\nThe problem requires to return \"the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target sum.\" So any correct pair is acceptable, not necessarily the first one. So in this example, both [0,1] and [2,3] are correct pairs.\n\nBut the function may return any one of them, depending on the two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, which is correct. But in the example above, when I sort the tuple list, the two elements with the smallest and largest is1 and4, which sum to5: correct. While 2 and3 (sorted as (2,2) and 3,3) are also 5. So the two-pointer approach may return either.\n\nBut in this example, the two-pointer approach would find 1+4=5 as the sum, so returns [0,1].\n\nBut according to the problem, is that acceptable?\n\nI think yes. Because any valid pair is acceptable. So the function correctly finds a pair.\n\nBut wait the problem's sample when nums is [2, 7, 11,15], target9, the sum is 2+7=9, which is what the two-pointer approach finds. So in that case, it's correct.\n\nAnother test case: when a pair exists but is not in the original order.\n\nWait, the problem description uses the two-pointer technique. So perhaps the two-pointer approach is not always correct if the list is not suitable.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I'm getting something wrong: the two-pointer approach for two-sum requires that the list is sorted, which allows it to find all pairs. But in cases where the list has duplicates or is not strictly increasing, the two-pointer approach may not find all pairs.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem's examples, in the two-sum function, any correct pair is acceptable, and the two-pointer is applied on the sorted list. So if the function returns any valid pair, it's correct.\n\nSo back to the process:\n\nIn code:\n\ndef two_sum_indices(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n    # step1: create list of (value, index)\n    indexed = [(val, idx) for idx, val in enumerate(nums)]\n    # step2: sort by value\n    indexed.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # step3: two-pointer\n    left = 0\n    right = len(indexed) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = indexed[left][0] + indexed[right][0]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            # collect indices, sort them, return as list\n            res = [indexed[left][1], indexed[right][1]]\n            res.sort()\n            return res\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left +=1\n        else:\n            right -=1\n    # step4: return empty\n    return []\n\nWait, but let's test it against the sample [2,7,11,15].\n\nindexed = [(2,0), (7,1), (11,2), (15,3)].\n\nfor target9: left=0(right=3) sum 17>9. move right to2. then left=0, right=2: 2+11=13>9. move right to1. sum2+7=9, so left=0, right=1. indices0 and1. sorted is [0,1], correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,3,3], target6. \n\nindexed is [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2)]. \n\nleft0, right2: sum6. So indices0 and2, which when sorted is[0,2]. So function returns [0,2]. But are there other pairs? [0,1], [1,2]. So function returns a valid pair but not necessarily the one expected.\n\nBut the sample expects for [1,3,3], target6, returns [1,2]. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [3,2,4], target5.\n\nThe indexed list is (2,1), (3,0), (4,2). left0, right2: 2+4=6>5, so right-1. left0, right1: 2+3=5. The indices are1 and0, sorted as [0,1]. So the function returns [0,1], which is correct.\n\nBut for nums = [1,4,2,3], target5: the sorted indexed list is (1,0), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1). So two-pointer approach:\n\nleft =0, right=3: 1+4=5: target met. So the pair is [0,3], but when sorted, [0,3] becomes [0,3]. However, 0 is the index of1, and3 is the index of4 in the original list. So 1 and4 sum to5. So function returns [0,1], because (0,1) are the indices of1 and4. But in the original list, the correct pairs could also be2 and3: indices2 and3. So function returns [0,1] which is correct, another pair is possible.\n\nSo the two-pointer approach is valid and returns a correct pair if it exists.\n\nTesting against all given samples:\n\nSample 1:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) \u2192 [0, 1] \u2192 correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([2,7,11,15], 17) \u2192 expects [0,3]. Let's see: 2+15=17, so left=0 and right=3. res is [0,3], sorted.\n\nSample 3:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([2,7,11,15],18) \u21927+11=18. In the sorted list, left is1, right is2. indices1 and2. So function will return [1,2].\n\nSample4:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([2,7,11,15],26) \u2192 sum of11+15=26. Insorted list, left at2, right3.\n\nYes, so function returns [2,3].\n\nSample5:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([1,3,3],6) \u2192 sum is3+3. sorted indices.\n\nSample6:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([2,7,11,15],8) \u2192 sum no.\n\nSample7:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([3*i for I in range(10)],19) \u2192 sum is19 no.\n\nSample8:\n\ntwo_sum_indices([1,2,3],6) \u2192 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5, none sum to6. So returns empty.\n\nThus, the function should pass these test cases.\n\nWhat about when no pair exists? Like in the examples, returns empty list.\n\nNow, to test the scenario where the two-pointer approach finds a pair that's not the expected one. But perhaps no such test case exists because the two-pointer approach is designed to find any pair while scanning.\n\nWait, the issue is when the function returns a pair based on the tuple's order, which could potentially not match the intended order, but whatever is found is correct. So the function is correct.\n\nPotential issues: The case where the same element is considered. But as per two_sum_indices, the function can return indices where i andj are different.\n\nAnother point: handle the scenario when an empty list is passed, or a list with single element. But the problem's doctests have no such cases, perhaps because it's assumed that the function is called with at least two elements.\n\nWait, for nums = [5], target10? Then function returns empty list.\n\nAnother example: nums = [0,0], target=0: returns [0,1].\n\nHence, the code handles that.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nSame element at both ends, the function returns their indices when the sum is target.\n\nSo, code-wise, the function seems correct.\n\nHence, the function in the code as outlined should pass all tests.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the indices of two numbers in a given list that add up to a specified target sum. We will use the two-pointer technique, which is efficient for finding pairs in a sorted list. The solution involves sorting the list while keeping track of the original indices, applying the two-pointer technique to find the pair, and then returning the indices in the correct order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Create a List of Tuples**: We start by creating a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number from the input list and its corresponding index. This allows us to keep track of the original positions while sorting the list by values.\n2. **Sort the List**: The list of tuples is sorted based on the values. This allows us to apply the two-pointer technique effectively.\n3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Initialize two pointers, one starting at the beginning (left) and the other at the end (right) of the sorted list. Move the pointers towards each other based on the comparison of the current sum with the target:\n   - If the current sum is exactly the target, return the indices in ascending order.\n   - If the current sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.\n   - If the current sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n4. **Return Result**: If a valid pair is found, return the indices sorted in ascending order. If no valid pair is found after the pointers meet, return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef two_sum_indices(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n    # Create a list of tuples with value and original index\n    indexed = [(val, idx) for idx, val in enumerate(nums)]\n    # Sort the list based on the values\n    indexed.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    left = 0\n    right = len(indexed) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = indexed[left][0] + indexed[right][0]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            # Get the original indices and sort them before returning\n            res = [indexed[left][1], indexed[right][1]]\n            res.sort()\n            return res\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    # Return empty list if no pair is found\n    return []\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Tuple Creation and Sorting**: By creating a list of tuples and sorting it by values, we can efficiently apply the two-pointer technique while keeping track of the original indices.\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: This technique allows us to find the pair in O(n) time complexity by adjusting the pointers based on the current sum, ensuring that we explore all possible pairs efficiently.\n- **Result Ordering**: After finding a valid pair, we sort the indices to ensure the result is returned in ascending order, which meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target sum while maintaining the order of indices as expected.",
