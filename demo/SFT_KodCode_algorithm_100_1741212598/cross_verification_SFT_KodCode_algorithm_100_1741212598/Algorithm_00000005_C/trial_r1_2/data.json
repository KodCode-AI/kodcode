  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called two_sum_indices that takes a list of integers and a target sum. The function should return the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target. If there are no such pairs, it returns an empty list.\n\nHmm, the examples provided show that sometimes it's possible, like in the first test case where [2,7,11,15] with target 9 gives [0,1], because 2 +7 equals 9. But another example like with target 8 returns empty because none of the pairs add up to 8.\n\nWait, so how do I approach this? The description says to use the two-pointer technique. Oh right, that's usually efficient for this kind of problems. But wait, the two-pointer method typically works on sorted arrays. Oh right, so I think the idea is to sort the list, but then keep track of the original indices because the result requires the indices from the original list.\n\nWait, but if we sort the list, the indices will change. So how can I get the original indices? Maybe I need to create a list of tuples where each tuple is (value, original index), then sort this list based on the values.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Create a list of tuples containing each number and its original index.\n2. Sort this list based on the numerical value.\n3. Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (left = 0) and one at the end (right = len(sorted_list) -1).\n4. Iterate while left < right.\n5. Compute the current sum: current_sum = sorted_list[left][0] + sorted_list[right][0].\n6. If current_sum == target, return the pair of indices [sorted_list[left][1], sorted_list[right][1]].\n7. If current_sum < target, move left pointer to the right (left +=1).\n8. If current_sum > target, move right pointer to the left (right -=1).\n9. If no pair is found after the loop, return an empty list.\n\nBut wait, are there any edge cases I should think about? Like if there are duplicate numbers. For example, the test case where nums is [1,3,3] and target is 6, the correct result is [1,2], which is the second and third element.\n\nLet me test the logic with this example. The tuple list would be [(1,0), (3,1), (3,2)]. Sorted, it's same as the original. So pointers start at 0 and 2.\n\nSum is 1+3=4, which is less than 6. So move left to 1. Now left=1, right=2. Sum is 3+3=6, which is the target. So the indices would be [1,2], which is correct.\n\nWhat about if there are multiple possible pairs? Like if the target can be achieved with more than one pair, which one do I choose? Looking at the examples, the function returns the first encountered pair? Or does it not matter as long as it's a correct pair.\n\nWait, in the function example, when the list is [2,7,11,15], target=17, the correct output is [0,3]. So 2+15=17. So the method would pick this pair.\n\nLet me think about the two-pointer approach with that example. After sorting, the list is [2,7,11,15]. Left=0, right=3. Sum is 17, so correct.\n\nBut what if the list was [3, 2,4,1] and target 4. After sorting, with tuples [(1,3), (2,1), (3,0), (4,2)]. The two pointers would check 1 and 4 (sum 5 >4), so right moves to 3,4[3] is 3? Wait, no, right was 3 initially. Sum is 1+4=5>4, so right becomes 2.\n\nNow check sum of [1,3] =4, which is target. So the indices are 3 and 0. So function would return [3,0]. But wait, in the original list, the elements are 3,2,4,1. So 3 is position 0, 2 is 1, 4 is 2, 1 is 3. The pair 1 (from position 3) and 3 (position 0) adds up to 4.\n\nBut what about checking all possible pairs? Like 2+2? But for that, the list would have to be [2,2,..] etc.\n\nAnother edge case is when there's only two elements. Like [5,5], target 10. Then the function should return [0,1].\n\nHmm. Also, when the list is empty or has one element, but the problem likely assumes the list has at least two elements because the function's test cases include at least of length 3.\n\nSo now, about the code.\n\nFirst, create the list of (value, index) tuples.\n\nsorted_nums = sorted( (num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums) ), and then sort by num.\n\nWait, more precisely, sorted_nums = sorted([ (num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums) ], key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nYes, because each tuple is (num, idx), and we sort by the num.\n\nThen, initialize left=0 and right=len(sorted_nums) -1.\n\nThen, while left < right.\n\nCalculate sum: current_sum = sorted_nums[left][0] + sorted_nums[right][0]\n\nIf current_sum == target:\n\n    then collect the indices as [ sorted_nums[left][1], sorted_nums[right][1] ]\n\n    then, perhaps we have multiple pairs, but in the test cases, as in [1,3,3], the last two elements are correct, but perhaps we need to find the earliest possible pair or the first match. But the two-pointer method may not capture all possibilities because once a pair is found, it's returned immediately.\n\nBut wait, the two-pointer approach may find the first pair in the sorted list, but whether it's the correct pair in terms of earliest occurrence or not is dependent on the problem.\n\nWait, the problem's function doesn't require a specific pair if multiple exist. It just needs any correct pair. But wait, looking at the examples:\n\nIn the fifth test case, the list is [1,3,3], target 6. The sum is 3 + 3 =6. The indices are [1,2].\n\nIf the function uses two-pointer, when left is 1 (value 3, index1) and right is 2 (value 3, index2), their sum is 6. So it returns indices 1,2.\n\nWhat if in another scenario, the same sum can be achieved by different pairs, but in different orders? How?\n\nSuppose sorted_nums has multiple pairs that sum to target. The two-pointer approach may find the first one in the sorted order.\n\nBut wait, perhaps this approach might miss some cases where a correct pair exists but isn't found by the two pointers because they skip over.\n\nWait, for instance, in the list [1, 2, 3, 4] and target 5: pairs are (1,4), (2,3). The two-pointer approach would find (1,4) first.\n\nBut the function returns the indices in the original list.\n\nYes, but according to the problem, any pair is acceptable as long as it's correct. Or does it require returning the earliest possible pair (like smallest indices)?\n\nWait, looking at the example [3* i for i in range(10)] which is [0,3,6,9,...,27], target 19. Let's see if any pair sums to 19.\n\nWait 0 + 19 is higher than 0. But the list is [0, 3, 6, 9, 12,15,18,21,24,27]. So 0 and 18 is 18, which is less than 19. 3 and 16? Wait 16 not in list. 6+13 not present. Etc. So no pairs, so function correctly returns empty.\n\nWait but wait, 9 + 10 is 19. But 10 is not in the list. So no, correct.\n\nSo now, the function correctly returns empty.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3], target 6.\n\nThe function returns empty because 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, let's think about writing the code.\n\nWe can start by creating the sorted list of tuples.\n\nWait but what if the list has only one element? Well, the function is called with nums as a list, but in practice, the list must have at least two elements to have a pair. So perhaps the code can handle that.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, create the sorted list:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nWait, because enumerate gives (index, value), and when we sort based on value, it will arrange the tuples in order of the value.\n\nWait wait, enumerate gives tuples of (index, value), but I need (value, index) for the sorted list, no.\n\nWait no, wait sorry.\n\nWait, I think I got it wrong earlier. Let's think: for each element in nums, I have an index and a value. I create a list of tuples where each tuple is (value, index). Then, I sort this list based on value.\n\nYes. So, in code:\n\nsorted_pairs = sorted( ( (nums[i], i) for i in range(len(nums)) ), key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nsorted_pairs = sorted( [ (nums[i], i) for i in range(len(nums)) ] , key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nOr, even better, using enumerate:\n\nsorted_pairs = sorted( ( (num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums) ), key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the tuple is (num, idx), sorted by num.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_pairs = sorted( ( (num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums) ), key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\nSo, that gives us a list sorted by the numbers, with each element being (num, original index).\n\nThen, set left = 0, right = len(sorted_pairs) -1.\n\nThen, while left < right:\n\nCompute sum: current_sum = sorted_pairs[left][0] + sorted_pairs[right][0]\n\nIf current_sum equals target: return the sorted pair's indices, but as a list.\n\nWait, no: when the sum matches, return the original indices. So the sorted_pairs[left][1] and sorted_pairs[right][1], as a list.\n\nSo, something like [sorted_pairs[left][1], sorted_pairs[right][1]]\n\nBut wait, need to make sure that the order is correct. For example, in the first test case: sorted_pairs would be [(2,0), (7,1), (11,2), (15,3)]. So left=0 and right=3 gives sum 17, target is 17? Wait one of the examples had target 9.\n\nWait wait, the first example is target 9, sum of 2+7=9.\n\nSo in that case, left would find 2 at start, and since it's sum is less than target, move left. Wait, but let's step through code.\n\nWait in target 9 for [2,7,11,15], sorted_pairs is in order 2,7,11,15.\n\nleft=0, right=3: current_sum =2+15=17>9. So right moves to 2.\n\nNext, sum 2+11=13>9, right moves to1.\n\nsum 2+7=9, which is the target. So return [0,1]. Correct.\n\nSo the function will return the sorted_pair indices correctly.\n\nNow, another point: When the sum is found, which pair to pick? Because sometimes the two-pointer approach may have to choose which one to move, but that doesn't affect correctness, just which pair is found.\n\nWait, in the case where there are multiple possible pairs, two-pointer will find the earliest left and right that sum to target.\n\nWhat if the target is 16 and sorted list is [2,7,9,8,11]. Wait no, sorted list would be [2,7,8,9,11], target 16. So possible pairs are 7 and 9 (16), 2 and 14 not present, etc. So in code, left=0, right=4: 2+11=13 <16. Move left to 1: 7+11=18>16. Move right to 3. 7+9=16, correct.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut what about in the case where multiple pairs are possible, and the two-pointer method would find the first possible pair in the sorted list. Is that acceptable for the function?\n\nSince the function requires any correct pair, yes.\n\nAnother edge case: nums is [0,0], target 0. The function should return [0,1].\n\nYes, because sorted_pairs is [(0,0), (0,1)].\n\nSum is 0, so return [0,1].\n\nAnother case: nums is [5,5,5], target 10. Possible pairs are (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). The two-pointer method will find (0,2) because sorted list is [5,5,5]. left=0 and right=2: 5+5=10, so return [0,2]. That's correct, although another correct pair is [0,1]. So in the function's test cases, maybe the first example in the list expects the first possible pair.\n\nBut the function's examples don't cover this, but the code seems to handle it.\n\nNow, what if the list is empty or has only one element? But the function is called with nums being a list, perhaps with any length, but in cases where len(nums) <2, the function should return empty.\n\nSo, in the code, perhaps before setting left and right, we can check if the list has at least two elements. Otherwise, return empty.\n\nBut according to the test case where nums = [2,7,11,15], the code would have sorted_pairs with len 4, so no problem.\n\nSo, in code, the function can be:\n\ndef two_sum_indices(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n    sorted_pairs = sorted( ( (num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums) ), key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    left = 0\n    right = len(sorted_pairs) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = sorted_pairs[left][0] + sorted_pairs[right][0]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            return [sorted_pairs[left][1], sorted_pairs[right][1]]\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    return []\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think about the case where multiple pairs are possible. For example:\n\nnums = [1,2,3,4,5], target=8.\n\nThe possible pairs are (3,5), (4,4\u2014 but no 4 in twice. Also 2+6, but 6 not in list.\n\nBut sorted list is [1,2,3,4,5]. So, initial left=0 and right=4: 1+5=6 <8. Left becomes 1: 2+5=7 <8. Left becomes 2: 3+5=8 \u2192 target. So return [2,4], which are indices 2 and4 in the sorted_pairs, which correspond to 3 and5 in the original list. Their original indices are correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the original list is [1,2,3,4,5], which is 0-based index.\n\nSo 3 is at index 2, 5 at index 4. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [3,3], target=6. The function should return [0,1].\n\nYes, because the sorted_pairs would be [(3,0), (3,1)]. The sum is 6, so return [0,1].\n\nWait, what about if the target is 7 and the list is [3,4,5, etc.]? I think the code would handle it.\n\nSo seems the code would handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the code against all the provided test cases.\n\nFirst test case:\n\nnums = [2,7,11,15], target=9.\n\nsorted_pairs is [(2,0), (7,1), (11,2), (15,3)].\n\nleft=0, right=3: sum=17>9 \u2192 right to 2.\n\nsum=13>9 \u2192 right to1.\n\nsum=9 \u2192 return [0,1].\n\nCorrect.\n\nSecond test case: target=17.\n\nsorted_pairs same.\n\nleft=0, right=3: sum=2+15=17 \u2192 return [0,3]. Correct.\n\nThird test case: target=18.\n\nleft=0, right=3: sum=17 <18, left to1. sum=7+15=22>18, right to2. Sum 7+11=18 \u2192 return [1,2]. Correct.\n\nFourth test case: target=26.\n\nleft=2, right=3: sum=11+15=26 \u2192 return [2,3]. Correct.\n\nFifth test case: nums= [1,3,3], target=6.\n\nsorted_pairs: [(1,0), (3,1), (3,2)].\n\nleft=0, right=2: sum=4<6 \u2192 left to1.\n\nsum=6\u2192 return [1,2]. Correct.\n\nNext test case: target=8.\n\nIn [2,7,11,15], possible pairs:\n\n2+7=9>8, 2+2 not present, 7+2= same. So no pair.\n\nso code returns empty.\n\nAnother test case: [3*i for i in 10], which is [0,3,6,9,12,...,27], which is 0 + rest, but does any pair add to target=19.\n\nLooking for two numbers that sum to 19: 0+19=19, but 19 is not present (since last number is 27 but step is 3\u2192 0,3,6,9, 12,15,18,21,24,27. Checking possible sums. 0 +19: not present.\n\nWhat about 1: but 1 is not in the list.\n\nWait 3 +16 \u2192 no.\n\n6+13: no.\n\n9+10: no.\n\nSo no pairs, function returns empty.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3], target=6.\n\nSum 3 and 3? No. 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 2+3=5. No pair sums to 6. So returns empty.\n\nWait function returns empty in this case.\n\nYes.\n\nAll test cases seem to be handled correctly.\n\nSo the code should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the indices of two numbers in a given list that add up to a specified target sum. The solution utilizes the two-pointer technique, which is efficient and works well with sorted arrays.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Create Tuples of Values and Indices**: First, we create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number from the input list and its corresponding index. This helps us keep track of the original positions of the numbers even after sorting.\n2. **Sort the Tuples**: The list of tuples is sorted based on the numerical values. This allows us to use the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the pair of numbers that add up to the target sum.\n3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We initialize two pointers, one at the start (left) and one at the end (right) of the sorted list. We compute the sum of the values at these pointers:\n   - If the sum equals the target, we return the corresponding indices.\n   - If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.\n   - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n4. **Return Result**: If no such pair is found after traversing the list, we return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef two_sum_indices(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n    if len(nums) < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    sorted_pairs = sorted(((num, idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums)), key=lambda x: x[0])\n    left = 0\n    right = len(sorted_pairs) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = sorted_pairs[left][0] + sorted_pairs[right][0]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            return [sorted_pairs[left][1], sorted_pairs[right][1]]\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    \n    return []\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Tuple Creation and Sorting**: By converting each number to a tuple (number, index) and sorting these tuples by the number, we can use the two-pointer technique which is efficient for finding pairs in sorted arrays.\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: This technique allows us to find the required pair in linear time, making the solution efficient. The technique works by adjusting the pointers based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where no pairs exist, returning an empty list. It also correctly handles cases with duplicate numbers and ensures the correct indices are returned based on the original list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct, providing the required pair of indices or an empty list if no such pair exists.",
