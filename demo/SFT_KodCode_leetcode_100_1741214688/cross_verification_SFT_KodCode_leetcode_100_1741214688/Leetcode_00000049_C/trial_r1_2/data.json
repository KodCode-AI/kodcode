  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the shortest contiguous subarray in a list of integers such that the sum is at least the target. If there's no such subarray, return 0.\n\nHmm, let's think about what the problem is asking. So, I have to look for the smallest window in the nums list where the sum of that window is equal to or greater than the target. And among all possible windows that satisfy this, I pick the one with the smallest length.\n\nFirst, I should consider some examples. Like, suppose nums is [2,3,1,2,4,3], target is 7. The subarrays here could be [2,3,1,2], sum is 8. Or [4,3], sum is 7. So the shortest length here is 2.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? One straightforward way is to check all possible subarrays and find the minimum length that meets the condition. But that would be O(n^2) time, which isn't efficient for large arrays.\n\nWait, the maximum n could be 10^5 or something? Well, but the problem doesn't specify the constraints. But regardless, I should think about an efficient way rather than brute force.\n\nAnother thought: If all the numbers are positive, then I can probably use a sliding window approach. Because adding numbers would monotonically increase the sum. But wait, the problem doesn't specify if the numbers can be negative or not. Oh, the list is given as List[int], so there might be negative numbers.\n\nHmm, sliding window might not work directly if there are negatives because adding an element to the window might decrease the sum. So that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a two-pointer approach is possible. Or maybe a deque for maintaining a window.\n\nWait, maybe using prefix sums could help. Let's think.\n\nThe prefix sum array is something where each element is the sum of the array up to that point. So, for prefix_s[i], it's sum(nums[0..i-1]).\n\nThen, the sum of elements from index i to j is prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i]. So, for each j, I want to find the smallest i such that prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target, and then j+1 -i is the length.\n\nBut regardless of whether the numbers are positive or negative. Wait, but if the array has negative numbers, the prefix sums can increase and decrease. So for a particular j, finding the smallest i where prefix_s[i] <= prefix_s[j+1] - target might not give me the correct i, because in cases where the prefix sum fluctuates.\n\nBut perhaps if I can track the minimal i for each j, I can find the maximum possible j-i for the current j.\n\nWait, I think I remember an approach where a monotonic deque is used to store possible candidates for i. Because for a given j, any i that is before the last i in the deque, and where the prefix_s[i] is not smaller than the current prefix_s[i], might help.\n\nWait, perhaps using a deque to keep the prefix sums in a way that we can efficiently find the earliest i where prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums of the array. Let's say prefix_s is the array of size n+1, where prefix_s[0] = 0, prefix_s[1] = nums[0], and so on.\n\n2. Initialize a deque (double-ended queue) that will store indices of prefix_s in a way that their corresponding values are increasing. Wait, because to find j+1, you want to find the smallest possible i such that prefix_s[j+1] - prefix[i] >= target. So for each j, you can look for the earliest i in the deque where prefix_s[i] <= prefix_s[j+1] - target.\n\n3. As we iterate j from 0 to n-1 (so j corresponds to nums[j], and j+1 corresponds to the end in prefix_s), we keep the deque updated. For each j, before processing, we might add j to the deque, but before that, we remove all elements from the end of the deque which have a prefix_s value >= prefix_s[j], because if a later prefix_s[j] is smaller, then for future j's, it would be a better candidate than those larger ones.\n\nThis is because, for future j's, if they have a certain value prefix_s[j], the smallest possible i would require prefix_s[i] to be as large as possible, but still <= (prefix_s[j] - target). So by keeping the deque in increasing order, we can efficiently find the earliest i which is the best candidate.\n\n4. Once the deque is updated, for the current j, we start checking from the front of the deque. We pop elements i from the front where prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target. The first such i would give the minimal possible window (since the deque is in order, the earliest i would have the largest possible window but wait, no: actually, if prefix_s[i] is as small as possible, then i is as far left as possible. Wait, no. The sum is prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] needs to be >= target. So for a fixed j+1, to get the smallest window length, we want the largest possible i (smallest index i) that satisfies the condition. Wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards.\n\nWait, no. For j fixed (so for the end of the window j), the sum is prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i]. We need this to be >= target. So for fixed j+1, the minimal length comes from the minimal window length, which corresponds to i being as small as possible? Or as large as possible? Because if i is as small as possible, the window is longer. But we want the minimal window, which would imply larger i (closer to j).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, for j, which is the end of the window, the possible i's are from 0 to j. For the window to be contiguous, the start index is i, so it ranges from 0 to j. We are looking for i such that prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target.\n\nThe sum is the same as if i is the start index of the window. So a smaller window would have a larger i. So for a given j, the earliest possible i (smallest) gives the largest window, but we can possibly find a later i which is larger, leading to a smaller window.\n\nSo for j, if I can find any i as close to j as possible where prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target, that would minimize the window length.\n\nSo how can the deque help here.\n\nSuppose the deque stores indices of prefix_s in an increasing order. So for the current j, when I iterate through the deque, I can check if any i in the deque after processing satisfies the sum condition.\n\nWait, the deque allows me to find the earliest i (smallest index) where the sum is >= target. But that would give me the largest possible window. That's opposite to what I want.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a binary search on each i to find the earliest possible j where the sum is greater than the target.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. Perhaps, for a sliding window approach to be applicable, all the elements must be positive. Because if they are not, adding elements doesn't guarantee that the sum will just keep increasing. So the sliding window approach works for all positive arrays because as you expand the window to the right, the sum increases, and when it exceeds the target, you can try to shrink from the left.\n\nBut when there are negative numbers, this approach might not work because once the sum exceeds the target, adding to the right may cause it to dip below again. So you can't just shrink the left without checking again.\n\nHmm, but in our problem, since we can have any integers, including negatives, the sliding window approach won't directly apply.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's possible to have it, but it's more complicated.\n\nAnother approach: considering the problem with only positive integers. Let's think about that case. So for the positive case, we can use a sliding window. Because as we add elements, the sum increases. So we can have a left and right pointer. We keep adding elements to the right until the sum is >= target. Then, we can record the window length and try to move the left pointer to the right to see if a smaller window exists, and so on. This would give us the minimal window in O(n) time.\n\nSo for positive numbers, this is efficient.\n\nBut if the numbers can be negative, as in the given problem, this approach would not work as mentioned earlier.\n\nSo perhaps the problem assumes that the numbers are all positive. Let me check the problem statement.\n\nOh, the problem says nums is a list of integers, which could include negatives, zeros, positives.\n\nHmm, so I can't rely on the sliding window approach.\n\nSo alternative idea: If I can keep track of the prefix sums and, for each j, find the smallest i which is as small as possible such that prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i] >= target. Or wait, wait, for a given j, I want the smallest i such that the sum is >= target. So, given the prefix_s[j+1], I need to find the earliest i where prefix_s[i] <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target). Or is it >=?\n\nWait, because sum is (prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i]) >= target => prefix_s[i] <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target).\n\nAh, right. So for each j+1, I want to find the earliest i (smallest possible) where prefix_s[i] <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target).\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nIf the prefix sums are monotonically increasing, which is the case when all nums are positive, then I can perform a binary search for each j. So for each j, I can find the minimal i where prefix_s[i] <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target). But that would be O(n log n) time.\n\nBut, if the prefix sums are not monotonic, binary search won't work as the array is not sorted.\n\nWait, but perhaps maintaining a deque which holds indices of prefix_s in a way that makes the values in the deque in a particular order allows us to efficiently find the earliest possible i.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSuppose I have a deque that contains indices of prefix_s in increasing order of their values. So each new index I add, I remove all previous indices from the end of the deque that have a prefix_s value >= current index's prefix_s value. This way, the deque remains sorted in increasing order.\n\nNow, for a given j+1, I want to find the earliest i such that prefix_s[i] <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target). So in the deque, I want to find the first element that is <= (prefix_s[j+1] - target).\n\nBut since the deque's prefix_s are in increasing order, once I find such an i, all elements after i in the deque are larger, so the first such i that meets the condition will be the earliest possible.\n\nWait, no. Because the deque is kept in increasing order of their prefix_s values. So when looking for the condition (prefix_s[i] \u2264 current value), the deque is ordered, so I can scan from the front.\n\nBut perhaps instead, using a monotonic deque, and for each j, adding the current j into the deque as long as certain conditions are met, allows me to find the earliest i that meets the condition.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array, prefix_s.\n2. Initialize a deque to keep track of indices in a way that their prefix_s values are in increasing order.\n3. For each j (which represents the current end of the window, from 0 to n), do the following:\n   a. While the deque is not empty and prefix_s[deque.back()] >= prefix_s[j], remove the back. Deque now has indices with increasing prefix_s, and the new j has a smaller or equal prefix_s than the back, so it's better to keep j than the previous indices because if a future j' comes in, j would have a smaller prefix_s and thus can be used earlier, leading to a smaller window.\n   b. Add j to the deque.\n   c. Then, while the deque is not empty and prefix_s[j] - target <= prefix_s[deque.front()], calculate the window length (j - deque.popleft() ). Keep track of the minimal length found so far.\n   d. Wait, no. Wait, j in this case is current index in the prefix_sum which is one more than the current in the original array. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between j in the prefix_s array and j in the original array.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The prefix sum has n+1 elements, from 0 to n. The sum of nums from i to j (0-based) is prefix_s[j+1] - prefix_s[i].\n\nSo for the current position in the original array, j, it corresponds to j in nums being up to j, and in prefix_s, positions 0 to j+1.\n\nSo maybe the index in the deque is the index in the prefix_s array.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the deque with the prefix_s indices and process each prefix_s[j] for j in 1..n.\n\nWait, alternative outline:\n\nFor each j in 1..n (so current end of the window is nums[j-1]):\n\n- Maintain a deque that has indices i, of the prefix_s array, which are 0 <= i <= j, and are ordered so that the prefix_s[i] in the deque are in increasing order.\n\n- For the current j, we want to find the smallest i (earliest possible) such that prefix_s[j] - prefix_s[i] >= target. This is equivalent to prefix_s[i] <= prefix_s[j] - target.\n\nWait, no, because if the prefix_s[j] - prefix[i] is >= target, then it's okay. So for a fixed j, the sum across i..j is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i], which I'm trying to find >= target.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is using a deque to store i for prefix[j+1], but I'm getting myself confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to process each j in 0 to n-1, and for each, process the prefix j+1.\n\nSo for each j (original array index 0-based), process j+1 as the current end.\n\nSo let's reindex:\n\nfor j in 0..n-1:\n    current_sum_end = prefix_s[j+1]\n    while deque is not empty and prefix_s[deque.back()] >= current_sum_end - target:\n        calculate the window length (j+1 - deque.popfront()) and see if it's minimal.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each j, the prefix_s[j] is the sum up to j-1 in the original array. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to step through an example.\n\nSuppose nums is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target is 7.\n\nCompute prefix_s: [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15].\n\nNow, for each j in 0..4 (original array), the end of the window is j in nums, and the corresponding prefix_s is j+1.\n\nWait, j=0: end is 0, sum is nums[0] =1.\n\nFor j=0, prefix_s[j+1] =1.\n\nLooking for i where prefix_s[i] <= 1 -7 = -6. So i cannot be smaller than 0.\n\nNo i exists in prefix_s, since i can be 0 only.\n\nSo sum is 1-0=1 <7. No window.\n\nj=1: sum is prefix[2] - prefix[i] >=7.\n\nprefix[2]=3. 3 - prefix[i] >=7 \u2192 prefix[i] <=-4.\n\nOnly possible i is 0: 0<=-4?\n\nNo. So sum is 3-0=3 <7.\n\nj=2: prefix[3]=6.\n\nLooking for i where prefix[i] <=6-7= -1.\n\nSo i can be 0, since prefix[0]=0 <=-1? No. So no solution.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition.\n\nThe sum from i to j (original array) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] >= target.\n\nSo for each j, the end is at j in nums, which is j+1 in prefix.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the original array is 0-based. So j is the end index of nums. The sum from i to j (0-based) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, perhaps the processing should be done with j in prefix_s from 1 to n.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I should refer to some known methods for the minimal length subarray with sum >= target.\n\nAh, online resources mention that when all nums are positive, the sliding window approach works. So perhaps in this problem, I should first handle the case where all elements are positive, and see if the deque approach can be used otherwise.\n\nWait, let's think about it: the problem allows for any integers. So perhaps I should consider both cases: when the array contains negatives, and when it doesn't.\n\nBut regardless, we need an approach that handles any integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deque approach can be modified.\n\nAnother idea: for each j, we can maintain a list of previous prefix_s values in a way that allows us to quickly find the minimal i which satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but the prefix_s array isn't necessarily monotonic. So data structures like a balanced BST won't help unless I can process the array in a way that allows for efficient querying.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal window can be found by examining all possible combinations, but this is O(n^2), which is not optimal.\n\nBut given time constraints, perhaps the correct approach involves using a deque to maintain a monotonic increasing or decreasing prefix_s, which allows for efficient binary search or index-based lookups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the deque to keep track of possible candidates for i and, for each j, checking the front of the deque.\n\nWait, I recall the approach used for the problem \"Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K\", which exactly matches the problem statement here. So perhaps the solution is to implement that problem's approach.\n\nLooking up the problem, indeed, the canonical solution uses a deque to maintain a monotonic queue of prefix sums.\n\nYes! That's exactly the same problem. So the standard approach is to compute the prefix sums, then use a deque that maintains a window of possible i's that could satisfy the condition for each j.\n\nSo the algorithm is as follows (from LeetCode problem 862):\n\n- Compute the prefix sum array. Let prefix be of length n+1, with prefix[0] =0, and prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + nums[i-1] for 1<=i<=n.\n\n- Initialize a deque. The deque will store indices of prefix in increasing order of their prefix values. This ensures that once we have a deque with increasing prefix values, for a new prefix[j], any previous i's with higher prefix values can be removed because if, for some k > j, prefix[k] - prefix[j] >= target, then j would be a better candidate than i (because prefix[j] is smaller).\n\nWait, no. Let's see: Suppose for a future j, prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target. But if j is the current index, then when processing j as the end, i can be considered as a candidate. Hmm, perhaps the deque is used differently.\n\nThe algorithm steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n\n2. For each j from 0 to n:\n\n   a. While the deque is not empty and prefix[j] <= prefix[deque.back()], remove the back element. Because for any future j', prefix[j] is smaller than those deque elements, so j would be a better i' than them (since prefix[j'] - prefix[i] is larger for j than for the ones in the deque).\n\n   So, the deque maintains that the prefix values are strictly increasing. Therefore, the deque contains indices in increasing order of both their position and their prefix sum.\n\n   Then, we add j to the deque.\n\n   b. Now, while the deque is not empty and prefix[j] is greater than or equal to (prefix[deque.front()] + target), then the subarray from deque.popleft() to j-1 (since j is the end?) might be a valid candidate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to refer to the exact steps:\n\nFor each j in 0..n:\n\n   While deque is not empty and prefix[j] <= prefix[deque.back()]:\n       deque.pop_back()\n   deque.append(j)\n\n   Now, while deque is not empty and prefix[j] - prefix[deque[0]] >= target:\n       current_length = j - deque.popleft()\n       if current_length < minimal_length:\n           minimal_length = current_length\n\nBut why do we do the second while loop?\n\nBecause, for j, any i in deque where prefix[i] <= prefix[j] - target will allow prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target. So once such an i is found, it's the earliest possible i for j, and the shortest possible window.\n\nBut when we find such an i, removing it allows us to process the next i which is larger than the current i, but may have a smaller window.\n\nHence, for j, we keep checking deque's front (smallest i), and for as long as prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target, we can calculate the window length and update minimal_length.\n\nOnce an i is found that doesn't satisfy this, we can stop because the deque is in order of increasing prefix, so any i after that will have larger prefix, leading to prefix[j] - prefix[i] possibly < target.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nCompute prefix.\n\nInitialize deque, minimal_length = infty.\n\nfor j in range(n+1):\n\n    while deque and prefix[j] <= prefix[deque[-1]]:\n        deque.pop()\n    deque.append(j)\n    \n    # Now find the earliest i such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target\n    while deque and prefix[j] - prefix[deque[0]] >= target:\n        i = deque.popleft()\n        current_length = j - i\n        if current_length < minimal_length:\n            minimal_length = current_length\n\nSo this would process each j in O(1) amortized time, because each element is added to and removed from the deque at most once.\n\nBut wait, the outer loop runs for j from 0 to n, which is O(n) steps, and each step involves potentially O(1) operations, except that each element is added once and removed once.\n\nHence, the overall time complexity is O(n).\n\nSo this is the correct approach.\n\nTesting on our example: nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target=7.\n\nCompute prefix: [0, 2,5,6,8,12,15].\n\nFor each j, compute the deque.\n\nInitialize minimal_length to infty.\n\nj=0: prefix[0]=0.\n\nDeque is empty, so append 0.\n\nDeque: [0]\n\nCheck if prefix[0] - prefix[0] >=7? 0-0=0 <7: no. So no change.\n\nj=1:\n\nprefix[1] = 2.\n\nDeque is [0]. Since 2 >= prefix[0] (0) is false, so compare and pop.\n\n2 >0, so no popping. Then append 1.\n\nDeque: [0,1]\n\nCheck while deque not empty and (2 - prefix[0]) >=7? 2-0=2 <7: no.\n\nSo no change.\n\nj=2: prefix=5.\n\nCompare with deque.back() which is 1 (prefix[1]=2<=5 \u2192 true. So no pop.\n\nAppend 2. Deque now [0,1,2].\n\nCheck while:\n\nprefix[2] - prefix[0] =5-0=5 <7 \u2192 no.\n\nj=3: prefix=6.\n\nDeque.back() is 2 with prefix[2] =5<=6 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo we pop 2? No, wait.\n\nWait, the while loop pops from deque.back() as long as prefix[j] <= prefix[deque.back()].\n\n6 is j's prefix, deque.back() is 2, prefix[2]=5.\n\n6 is larger than 5 \u2192 condition is 6 <=5 \u2192 false. So no pop.\n\nAppend 3 \u2192 deque is [0,1,3].\n\nCheck if 6 - prefix[deque[0]] >=7? 6 -0=6 <7: no.\n\nj=4: prefix=8.\n\nCompare to deque.back() (3, prefix=6 \u22648 \u2192 true. So no removal.

No. So loop stops.\n\nSo now minimal_length is 2.\n\nThus, the answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, as in our initial example.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, to code this:\n\nImplement as follows.\n\nImplement the steps:\n\nCompute the prefix sums.\n\nInitialize deque (e.g., using collections.deque in Python).\n\nInitialize the deque.\n\nFor each j in 0 to n (inclusive?), compute prefix[j], then process as per the steps.\n\nWait, the prefix sum has size n+1, and j ranges from 0 to n, inclusive.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums, target):\n\n    prefix = [0]\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n    \n    dq = deque()\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    \n    for j in range(len(prefix)):\n        # Maintain deque: remove from the end any indices with prefix >= current\n        while dq and prefix[j] <= prefix[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        dq.append(j)\n        \n        # Check front for possible minimal length\n        while dq and (prefix[j] - prefix[dq[0]] >= target):\n            i = dq.popleft()\n            min_len = min(min_len, j - i)\n    \n    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0\n\nWait, is this correct?\n\nLet me check.\n\nIn the example above, the code for j=0 to j=6 (since len(prefix)=7? Wait no, len(prefix) is 7 (n+1). So j runs from 0 to 6.\n\nWait, len(prefix) after processing the nums of length 6 is 7.\n\nSo j runs from 0 to 6, which is correct.\n\nNow, in the code, the while loop runs 'while dq is not empty and prefix[j] <= prefix[dq[-1]]'.\n\nThen, appends j.\n\nThen, 'while dq is not empty and (prefix[j] - prefix[dq[0]] >= target)':\n\nIf this is true, pop from front and compute window.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, subarray sums can be >= target, not strictly greater. So the >= is correct.\n\nTesting this code on the example I did earlier seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the standard problem, the nums can be all positive, which this code can handle as well.\n\nWhat about cases where there are no such subarrays? Like, if sum of all elements is less than target.\n\nFor example, nums = [1,2], target=4. Sum is 3 <4.\n\nPrefix is [0,1,3]. J runs from 0 to 2.\n\nFor j=2, prefix[j]=3.\n\nProcessing j=2:\n\nDeque after while loop is empty: so 2 is added.\n\nThen, check 3-0 \u22654? No. So the min_len remains infinity where no solution.\n\nSo the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [10, 2, 3], target=6.\n\nThe subarrays possible:\n\n[10] sum=10 \u2192 len1.\n\n[2,3] sum=5 \u2192 no.\n\n[3] sum=3 \u2192 no.\n\n[10,2] sum=12 \u2192 len2.\n\n[10,2,3] sum=15 \u2192 len3.\n\n[2,3] sum=5 no.\n\nSo the minimum length is 1 (the first element 10 is enough).\n\nBut wait, let's see:\n\nprefix = [0,10,12,15]\n\nFor j=0: added to deque.\n\nNo prefix[j] >= target.\n\nj=1: prefix is10.\n\nDeque is [0]. While 10 <= prefix[0]=0? No. So append 1.\n\nThen, check 10 - prefix[0] =10 >=6. So i=0 is popped, current_length =1 -0 =1. min_len=1.\n\nEach subsequent j would at least have min_len as 1, so the answer is correct.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [-1, 4, 2, 1], target=5.\n\nWait, what's the subarrays?\n\nNumbers include negatives.\n\nCompute prefix: [0, -1,3,5,6].\n\nLooking for sum >=5.\n\nPossible candidates:\n\nAt j=index 3 (prefix is5), which corresponds to sum up to original index 2.\n\nWhich is 4+2=6. which is>=5.\n\nCheck for i: prefix[j=3]=5 >= prefix[i] +5?\n\nprefix[i] =5 -5=0. So looking for prefix[i] <=0.\n\nLooking in prefix array:\n\nPossible i's: 0 (prefix[0] =0), 1 (prefix[1]=-1).\n\nSo for j=3, i can be 1: 3-1=2. Or i=0: 3-0=3.\n\nWait, the minimal would be 2.\n\nBut let's see how the code handles this:\n\nDeque for j=3 (prefix is5):\n\n- When processing j=0:\n\ndeque is [0]. Nothing else.\n\nj=1, prefix=-1:\n\n- Since -1 <= prefix[deque[0]=0], so the condition is true. So dq.pop(), deque becomes empty. Append 1.\n\nThen, check if -1 - (-1) >=5? 0>=5? No.\n\nSo min_len remains inf.\n\nj=2, prefix=3.\n\nDeque is [1].\n\n3 > prefix[1]=-1 \u2192 condition fails. So append 2. deque is [1,2].\n\nCheck if 3 - prefix[1]=-1=4 >=5? No.\n\nj=3, prefix=5.\n\nNow, before processing, check:\n\n5 > prefix[2]=3 \u2192 no popping.\n\nAppend 3. Deque becomes [1,2,3].\n\nCheck if 5 - prefix[1]=-1 \u21926 >=5: yes.\n\nSo i=1, popped. current_length=3-1=2. So min_len=2.\n\nThen, check next in deque: 2,3.\n\n5 - prefix[2]=3 \u21922 <5: condition fails, loop stops.\n\nSo after j=3, min_len is2.\n\nj=4, prefix=6.\n\nCheck the deque: prefix[j]=6.\n\nprefix is larger than prefix[ dq[-1]=3:5], so it's 6>5, so condition (6 <=5) is false. So append 4. deque now [1,2,3,4].\n\nCheck: 6 - prefix[1]=-1=7 >=5.\n\ni=1 is popped, current_length=4-1=3. Since current min is2, which is smaller, no change.\n\nHowever, after popping 1, the next deque is [2,3,4].\n\nCheck 6 - prefix[2]=3:3 >=5? No.\n\nThus, no further changes.\n\nSo the minimal_length remains 2.\n\nWhich is correct as the subarray from 0 to2 (indexes 1,2,3 in the original array? Or is it the indices in prefix).\n\nWait, i is 1 in prefix: which is sum up to 0 in the original array. So the subarray from i=0+1 to j=3, which is indices 1,2,3. So nums[0] is included if any.\n\nWait, perhaps the prefix is a bit confusing.\n\nIn any case, the minimal_length is correctly computed as 2, as in the example.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases, including with negative numbers.\n\nBut in the initial code, the for loop is for j in range(len(prefix)).\n\nWhich is correct as len(prefix) is n+1, with j being each index from0 to n.\n\nThus, the code should correctly compute the minimal length.\n\nSo to sum up, the approach is to compute the prefix sum and maintain a deque of indices of prefix in increasing order of their prefix sum values. For each j, remove from the deque any indices where the prefix sum is not smaller than current j's, and then add j. Then, while the deque is not empty and the current prefix minus the deque's front is >= target, pop the front and update the minimal length.\n\nNow, implement this code in Python.\n\nAlso, handle the case when min_len remains infinity (no such subarray exists), returning 0.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the shortest contiguous subarray in a list of integers such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is at least a given target. If no such subarray exists, we return 0.\n\n### Approach\nThe key idea is to use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain indices of the prefix sums in a way that allows us to efficiently find the shortest subarray. The approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Compute the Prefix Sum Array**: This array helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray using the difference of two prefix sums.\n\n2. **Maintain a Monotonic Deque**: The deque stores indices of the prefix sum array in increasing order of their values. This ensures that for each new prefix sum, we can efficiently find the earliest index that allows us to form a valid subarray.\n\n3. **Iterate Through Prefix Sums**: For each index, we maintain the deque by removing elements from the back if the current prefix sum is smaller. This ensures that only relevant candidates for forming valid subarrays are kept.\n\n4. **Check for Valid Subarrays**: For each index, check if the current prefix sum minus the smallest prefix sum (front of the deque) meets or exceeds the target. If it does, calculate the window length and update the minimum length if necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    prefix = [0]\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n    \n    dq = deque()\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    \n    for j in range(len(prefix)):\n        # Maintain the deque to keep indices with increasing prefix sums\n        while dq and prefix[j] <= prefix[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        dq.append(j)\n        \n        # Check for valid subarrays\n        while dq and (prefix[j] - prefix[dq[0]] >= target):\n            i = dq.popleft()\n            current_length = j - i\n            if current_length < min_len:\n                min_len = current_length\n    \n    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is constructed such that `prefix[i]` stores the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n2. **Deque Maintenance**: The deque is used to keep track of indices of the prefix sum array. For each new element, we remove elements from the back of the deque that have a higher or equal prefix sum to the current element. This ensures that the deque always contains indices in increasing order of their prefix sums.\n\n3. **Finding Shortest Subarray**: For each index, we check if the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the front of the deque meets or exceeds the target. If it does, we update the minimum length and remove the front element from the deque to check for potentially shorter subarrays.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray by leveraging the properties of prefix sums and a monotonic deque, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n).",
