  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the shortest subarray in a given list of integers such that the sum is at least a given target. Hmm, the function is called shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target, and I need to return the length of the shortest such subarray or 0 if there's none.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the brute force approach would be. I could check every possible subarray, calculate the sum, and keep track of the minimum length where the sum meets or exceeds the target. But wait, brute force is probably going to be too slow, especially for larger arrays. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about what makes a subarray have a sum >= target. The subarray can be of any length, starting from 1 up to the entire array. But I want the shortest one. So maybe I should look for the smallest window that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, sliding window technique maybe? That's commonly used for finding minimal windows with certain sum constraints. But sliding window usually works well for non-negative numbers because adding elements to the window increases the sum. But here, the array could have negative numbers. Oh wait, does it? Let me check the function's parameters. Oh right, it's a list of integers, so yes, negatives are possible. That complicates things because a sliding window approach that just expands the window when the sum is not met might not work because adding a negative could reduce the sum.\n\nHmm, so maybe the sliding window approach isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe a deque can be used to maintain the indices of useful elements. Or maybe a prefix sum approach?\n\nWait, prefix sums often help in subarray sum problems. Let's think about that. The prefix sum array can give me the sum up to each index. Then, for each ending index j, I can look back to see if there's an earlier index i such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target. The smallest j-i for such j and i would be a candidate for the minimal length.\n\nBut how to efficiently find this for each j? Because if I naively check all i's before j, it's O(n^2), which is not better than brute force.\n\nAh, right! So perhaps I need a way to efficiently find the earliest or latest index that satisfies the condition. Let's see, in the case where all numbers are positive, I can maintain a windows start since adding elements increases the sum. But with negative numbers, that's not possible.\n\nSo, maybe for each j, I can keep track of a monotonic queue of some sort. Wait, here's an idea: perhaps we can maintain a deque that contains indices in a way that prefix[j] is in increasing order. Then, for each j, I can find the smallest i such that prefix[j] - prefix[i] >= target. Because if the prefix is increasing, then we can binary search for the earliest prefix[i] that is <= (prefix[j] - target). The minimal j-i is the length of the subarray from i+1 to j.\n\nAlternatively, wait, that approach would require the prefix sum to be monotonically increasing. But if the array contains negative numbers, the prefix sum might not be increasing. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I'm again stuck. Let's think: For the minimal subarray that meets the target sum, perhaps the subarray is among the minimal windows with a sum that is just meeting the target.\n\nAlternatively, considering that we have to find a subarray where the starting point is as far right as possible, so that the length is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try an approach similar to the one used in the problem of shortest subarray with sum at least K. Oh right, that problem (I remember on LeetCode) does this, where K is the target. And the solution uses a sliding window approach but only works when the array contains positive numbers. Or wait, wait: no, that problem does have to deal with possibly negative numbers.\n\nWait, I think the approach uses a deque to maintain a window of potential starting indices. Let me recall. In that solution, when computing the prefix sum for each j, we use a deque to keep track of the smallest possible prefix[j], but in a way that allows for finding the earliest i that satisfies the condition.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can adapt that approach here. Let me outline the steps.\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array. Let prefix_sum be such that prefix_sum[0] = 0, and prefix_sum[i+1] = nums[0]+...+nums[i]. So the sum of the subarray from i to j is prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].\n\n2. Now, for each j, I want the smallest possible j-i, such that prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i] >= target. But to find this efficiently, I can keep a deque of indices in the prefix_sum array.\n\n3. The deque should contain indices i in such a way that prefix_sum[i] is kept in a way that allows efficient checking. For each j, I can pop from the deque any indices i where prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j]. Wait, no, the condition might be different.\n\nWait, in the standard approach for shortest subarray sum >= K, which works in O(n) time, the deque is maintained such that the elements inside are increasing. Also, for each j, you remove from the front of the deque any i where prefix_sum[j] >= prefix_sum[i], because then i is no longer useful as a starting point. Because for any future j, prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target would imply earlier i's could have produced a shorter window.\n\nWait, let me think carefully. Suppose we have a deque of i's such that prefix_sum[i] are in increasing order. For each current j, we look at the deque and, for the front i, check if prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target. If yes, then we can record the window length as j - i, and since we're looking for the minimal length, once we find a valid i, we can remove it from the front because any following i's would have a larger i, leading to a smaller window. If not, we might need to look further.\n\nWait, perhaps not. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think: deque stores indices of prefix_sum in increasing order. For each j, we first remove any i from the deque where prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j], because if for a later j', prefix_sum[j'] - prefix_sum[i] is >= target, then using a smaller i (with smaller prefix_sum[i]) may result in a more minimal window. So storing the i's in a way that ensures that i's with higher prefix_sum are processed first.\n\nAlternatively, when considering adding a new i to the deque, we remove all i's in the deque that have a prefix_sum >= prefix_sum[i], since i is a better candidate for future checks. So the deque remains in increasing order.\n\nSo after building the deque, for each j, we check the front of the deque:\n\n- If prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[front] >= target, then the window starting at front+1 and ending at j is a candidate. We can record the minimal length. Since we want the earliest possible i, the first i that satisfies is the best, so after finding such an i, we can pop it from the deque and move to the next element.\n\nWait, no. Because maybe the next i in the deque is even better (smaller i leads to longer window, but perhaps not... Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Perhaps I should check the LeetCode problem or some resource, but since I'm just thinking, let's try to outline.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums. Let prefix_sum be an array where prefix_sum[0] = 0, and prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] for i >=1.\n\n2. Initialize a deque to keep track of possible starting indices. The deque will store indices i of the prefix_sum array, and these indices are kept in a way that their prefix_sum is in increasing order.\n\n3. For each j (starting from 0 to len(prefix_sum)-1):\n\n   a. You add j to the deque, but first remove all elements from the back of the deque which have a prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[those elements]. This ensures that the deque is always an increasing sequence.\n\n   b. Then, as long as the deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target, we can record the window length j - deque.popleft(), and update the minimal length.\n\nWait, wait. No, because in this problem, the sum needs to be at least target. So for each j, after maintaining the deque properly, we check the front of the deque (smallest i) and see if prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target. If yes, then this is the earliest i for j that could form a valid subarray, which would be the minimal possible for j. So we record the length as j - deque.popleft() and continue.\n\nBut this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try an example. Suppose the prefix_sum is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10], and target is 6. Let's see how the deque works.\n\nWhen j=0: prefix_sum[j] = 0. Deque is empty, so add 0.\n\nj=1: prefix_sum[j]=1. The deque has 0. Adding j=1: can we add to the deque? Compare prefix_sum[j] (1) with prefix_sum[back]. The previous index in the deque is 0 with sum 0. 1 >0, so we don't pop it. So deque becomes [0,1].\n\nWait, but for the condition, when adding j to the deque, we remove all elements at the end which have prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[j_new]. Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. I think when adding a new index j to the deque, we remove all previous indices from the end where prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[previous indices], because if we have j and previous indices i where prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j], then i is not useful for future j's. Because for any future j', if prefix_sum[j'] - prefix_sum[j] >= target, it will also satisfy prefix_sum[j'] - prefix_sum[i] >= target? Or is it the opposite.\n\nWait, the deque is maintained in increasing order of prefix_sum. So when we add j, we remove all elements from the end whose prefix_sum is >= prefix_sum[j], because j can serve as a better (since it's earlier or has a lower sum, or wait, maybe earlier comes with a lower sum but higher index, which is more useful for smaller window sizes.\n\nWait, perhaps an example will help. Let's say the current deque has indices [i1, i2, i3], with prefix_sum[i1] <= prefix_sum[i2] <= prefix_sum[i3]. Now, when adding a new index j, if prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i3], we can remove i3 because for any future k, if prefix_sum[k] - prefix_sum[j] >= target, then since prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[i3], prefix_sum[k] - prefix_sum[i3] would also be >= target, making i3 redundant. So we can remove i3 from the deque before adding j.\n\nTherefore, the process is: for each j, pop all elements from the end of deque where prefix_sum of those elements is >= prefix_sum[j]. Then, append j to the deque.\n\nAs for when to compute the window, after maintaining the deque, for each j, we check if the front of the deque is such that prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[front] >= target. If so, then we can have a subarray starting at front index and ending at j-1 (since prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] is sum from i+1 to j).\n\nWait, not quite. Wait, the prefix_sum[j] is the sum up to index j-1 of nums. So the sum from i to j-1 is prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]. So when j includes more elements, the subarray is longer.\n\nBut we are looking for j in prefix_sum, which is of length n+1.\n\nLet me correct this: the j in the for-loop is 0 to len(prefix_sum)-1. So for j, it's the index in prefix_sum, which is from 0 to m where m is len(nums)+1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the prefix sum indexing.\n\nWait, let's redefine: prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = nums[0], prefix_sum[2] = nums[0]+nums[1], etc. So the sum of subarray from i to j (inclusive) is prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].\n\nSo to get the sum for a subarray ending at j, j is the end index in nums.\n\nIn the standard problem, for the sliding window approach, the deque is maintained to keep track of possible starting indices.\n\nSo for j in 0 to n (nums is 0-based) len(prefix_sum) is n+1.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Compute the prefix sum: prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = nums[0], prefix_sum[2] = nums[0] + nums[1], etc.\n\n- Initialize deque.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of prefix_sum in 0 to m-1, where m is len(prefix_sum) = len(nums)+1.\n\nThe deque will then hold indices of prefix_sum, i, such that i corresponds to a possible starting point.\n\nSo, for each j (from 0 to m-1), we do:\n\na. While the deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]], we pop from the deque. Because for any future j, j' >= j, if prefix_sum[j'] - prefix_sum[j] >= target, and if j is in the deque after some other index i where prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[j], then i can be removed, since using j as the starting point would give a better (smaller) window than using i.\n\nb. Append j to the deque.\n\nc. Then, as long as the deque is not empty, compute if prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target. If yes, then the window is from deque[0] to j-1 in prefix_sum, which is nums[deque[0]+1 : j]. So the length is j - deque[0]. We can compare and see if this is the minimal. Since we're trying to find the shortest, once we find such a window, we can update the minimal and perhaps break out of the inner loop, but the problem is that there might be multiple i's that could form a window ending at j, but perhaps the further i's in the deque might give a smaller window.\n\nWait no, actually, the minimal window would be the one with the earliest i, because j is fixed. So the earliest i would give the largest possible window length. Wait no, earlier i (smaller i) gives a larger window. For minimal length, we need the latest i possible that still satisfies the sum condition.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the initial approach. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternative approach: For each j, the minimal window is the earliest i where prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target. Because, for j, the earliest i will give the maximal length subarray, but perhaps a later i could give a shorter one.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let's think: the minimal window is the smallest j-i possible where prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target. To find this, for each j, we can look for the smallest possible i (closest to j) that satisfies this condition.\n\nSo in this case, we can, for each j, look for the earliest i in the deque (since it's sorted by prefix_sum) such that prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target.\n\nOnce such i is found, the subarray is from i to j, and the length is j-i. We can compare this to the current minimum and keep the smallest.\n\nBut to do this efficiently, the deque needs to be a list of i's in increasing order of prefix_sum, so that for each j, we can perform a binary search or iterate from the front to find the earliest i that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps in this scenario, the deque's elements are kept in increasing order of prefix_sum. So for each j in prefix_sum, after maintaining the deque as per step a and b, we can compare prefix_sum[j] minus the front of the deque's prefix_sum.\n\nIf it meets the target, we can record the window length and also remove the front because any other i after it would only result in a longer or equal window. Or, wait, no. Maybe we can't remove it because a later j' could have a higher prefix_sum and thus when paired with this i, may give a valid sum.\n\nBut perhaps for the current j processing, once a valid i is found, we can compute the window and then remove that i since it can't provide a better window for j. But then other j's may find it useful.\n\nHmm, I'm not exactly sure. Perhaps in the standard approach, after adding j to the deque properly, for the current j, we check the front of the deque, and as long as the condition is satisfied (prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= target), we can compute the window length, update the minimal, and remove i from the deque. Because it's the earliest possible i, and any further j's may not help in getting a better window for i's that have been already used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to keep searching the deque until the condition is no longer true.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the code structure.\n\nIn the code, the function starts by initializing the deque and the minimal length as infinity. Then loop through each index in prefix_sum.\n\nFor each j in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n\n   while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n       deque.pop()\n   deque.append(j)\n\n   # Now check the front of deque\n   while prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target:\n       window_length = j - deque.popleft()\n       if window_length < min_length:\n           min_length = window_length\n\nBut wait, no, because the subarray is from deque[0] to j-1 in nums. So the window length is j - deque[0].\n\nBut in the code above, after appending j, we only check the front of the deque each time.\n\nWait in the code from the LeetCode solution, for the problem \"Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K\":\n\nThey compute the prefix_sum and for each j, maintain a deque of increasing indices of prefix_sum. They append j after popping all deque elements with a prefix_sum >= prefix_sum[j]. Then, while the deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K, they compute the window and pop the front.\n\nSo perhaps the code structure is like that.\n\nWait, but why? Because in the deque, the elements are in increasing order of their prefix_sum. So for each j, the front of the deque is the earliest possible i that could have the smallest prefix_sum, which would make prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] as large as possible. So for j, if any i in the deque exists such that the sum >= target, the first such i is the earliest possible. But when we find such an i, after processing, do we need to remove it?\n\nWait, in the code, for each j, we append j to the deque as described. Then, while the deque is not empty and condition holds, we compute the window and pop the front. So, for the same j, we might pop multiple i's in a row.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose the deque has several i's which prefix_sum is <= K. Then, for j=3, all those i's would satisfy the condition if their prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] is >= target. So, once we find that the first i in deque satisfies, and once it's popped, the next i now becomes front. So, for the same j, we check again.\n\nBut wait, I'm probably getting something wrong here. Let's think with a sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 6.\n\nCompute prefix_sum: [0,1,3,6,10].\n\nExpected output: 1 (since 6 is present as a single element).\n\nFor j=3 (prefix_sum[3] =6):\n\n- The deque is [0,1,2]. We process j=3:\n\n   - check if prefix_sum[3] (6) <= any of the last elements in the deque: 0,1,2's prefix sums are 0,1,3.\n\n   - So, 6 >3, so we don't pop. Append j=3. Deque becomes [0,1,2,3].\n\n   - Now, for the condition, check if prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] (6-0) >=6: yes.\n\n   - Compute window length 3-0=3. Update min_length if 3 is smaller than current min. Pop 0 from deque.\n\n   - Now deque is [1,2,3].\n\n   - Check again: 6 -1=5 <6? So no.\n\nSo for j=3, only one i is considered (i=0). Then processing stops.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nnums = [10, 2, -14, 1], target = 10.\n\nAccording to the standard solution, the minimal length is 1.\n\nCompute prefix_sum: [0,10,12,-2, -1].\n\nProcessing each j:\n\nj=0: deque becomes [0].\n\nj=1: prefix_sum[1] =10. deque initially empty after popping any i where prefix_sum[j] is not larger.\n\nWait: deque starts empty.\n\nWait, let's process step by step.\n\nInitialize deque as empty, min_length = infinity.\n\nj=0: prefix_sum=0.\n\n   - since deque is empty, append 0. Deque becomes [0].\n\n   - Now, check if 0 - 0 >=10? No. So do nothing.\n\nj=1: prefix_sum=10.\n\n   - compare with deque's last element (0). prefix_sum[1]=10>prefix_sum[0]=0? So we can pop 0? Or no, wait: in step a, the condition is to pop from deque while deque not empty and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]].\n\nAt j=1, prefix_sum[j]=10.\n\ndeque is [0]. prefix_sum[j] =10, prefix_sum[deque[-1]] =0. 10>0, so condition not met. So we don't pop anything. Append 1 to deque. Deque [0,1].\n\n   Now, check the front: 10 - prefix_sum[0]=10 >=10: yes.\n\n   So compute window length 1-0=1.\n\n   Update min_length to 1.\n\n   Pop 0 from deque. Deque becomes [1].\n\n   Now, check new front: 10 - 1's prefix_sum (10). 10-10=0 >=10? No. So stop.\n\nProceed to j=2:\n\nprefix_sum[j=2] =12.\n\n   Now, check deque's last element (1, prefix_sum=10). Is 12 <=10? 12>10, so don't pop. Append 2. Deque [1,2].\n\n   Now, check front: 12 -1's prefix_sum (10) >=10: yes.\n\n   Window length 2-1=1. min_length remains 1.\n\n   Pop 1 from deque. Now deque is [2].\n\n   Check new front: 12 -12=0 <10: stop.\n\nj=3: prefix_sum[j]= -2.\n\n   Compare with deque's last (2, prefix_sum=12). -2 <12? Yes. So pop 2. deque becomes empty.\n\n   Now, append 3 to deque.\n\n   Now, check if -2 - (nothing) ... Wait, deque is [3], so what's prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[3]? 0 <10.\n\n   So no change.\n\nj=4: prefix_sum= -1.\n\n   Compare with last element 3: prefix_sum[4] is -1, which is > prefix_sum[j=3] of -2?\n\nWait, no: -1 >-2 is True. So no, we don't pop 3. Then append 4.\n\nCheck front: prefix_sum[j=4] - prefix_sum[j=3] =-1 - (-2 )=1 <10.\n\nSo no change.\n\nSo min_length remains 1, which is correct.\n\nSo for this example, the code works.\n\nAnother sample: nums = [2, -1, 2], target=3.\n\nCompute prefix_sum: [0,2,1,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\nj=0: add 0. No check.\n\nj=1: prefix_sum=2.\n\n   Since 2>0, add to deque. Deque [0,1].\n\nCheck front: 2-0=2 >=3? No.\n\nj=2: prefix_sum=1.\n\n   deque[-1] is 1: prefix_sum[j]=1=prefix_sum[1] (1=1)? Yes, so pop 1. deque is [0].\n\n   Now, j=2 >=0, compare prefix_sum[j]=1 with prefix_sum[0] =0. 1>'0, so append 2. deque [0,2].\n\n   Now, check front: 1-0=1 >=3? No.\n\nj=3: prefix_sum=3.\n\n   Since 3> prefix_sum[2] =1, so don't pop. Append 3. deque becomes [0,2,3].\n\n   Check front: 3-0=3 >=3. window length 3-0=3. current min is infinity, so update to 3.\n\n   pop 0. deque becomes [2,3].\n\n   Now, check front: 3 -2=1 <3? No.\n\n   So done.\n\nj=3, another possible i:\n\nWait, is there a shorter window? What about j=3, i=2: prefix_sum[3] - prefix_sum[2]=3-1=2 <3. So not.\n\nWhat about i=3: sum is 0 (for 1 element, but that's just 3? No, subarray from 3 to 3 is 3, which meets target. So prefix_sum[4] (wait no, j=3 corresponds to sum up to 3 in prefix_sum. Wait, the nums is [2,-1,2], so prefix_sum is:\n\nprefix_sum[0]=0.\n\nprefix_sum[1]=2.\n\nprefix_sum[2]=2 + (-1)=1.\n\nprefix_sum[3]=1+2=3.\n\nSo, for j=3, the subarray ends at 2 (last element). So for i=3, that is, to get subarray from 3 starts and ends at 3: no, i can't be 3 for j=3 because j=3 is prefix_sum up to index 2 in nums.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the indices.\n\nWait, the subarray for j=3 (prefix_sum) is from i=... to j.\n\nWait, the subarray is from i+1 to j-1 in nums.\n\nWait no, for the prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] = sum of nums[i...j-1].\n\nSo for j=3, i can be 0: sum is nums[0..2], which is 3. So minimal length is 3.\n\nBut maybe another i exists. Like i=3 is prefix_sum[3], but then the subarray is from i=3 to j=3, which would be the sum of 0. That's no good.\n\nWait perhaps there's a shorter subarray? Like for i=2: prefix_sum[j]=3 - prefix_sum[2]=1 =2: no.\n\nWait, but wait in the sample above, the code returns 3, but the array [2, -1, 2] has a sum 3, which is the entire array, giving a length of 3. But perhaps there's a shorter subarray.\n\nYes, indeed: the first element 2 and the last 2: 2+(-1)+2=3, but another possible subarray is [2,-1,2]. Or is there a shorter one?\n\nWhat if I take the first 3 elements? No, that's the same as the entire array. Or, perhaps the number of elements is to be considered?\n\nWait, in nums = [2, -1, 2], the subarray [2, -1, 2] is length 3. But what about the first two elements, 2-1=1 <3. No. The last two elements: -1+2=1 <3. Hmm. So the minimal subarray is indeed 3.\n\nWait, but what if we have nums [1, 4, 2, 2, 1], target=7. Suppose the sum can be achieved in several ways, but the minimal is 1 (if any element is >=7. Or not, if target is 7 and nums have no single element >=7, then the code correctly finds the minimal window.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the code for this.\n\nNow, what about handling all the possible prefix_sum[j] and the deque.\n\nBut wait, the code in the LeetCode problem is for sums >= K where all numbers are positive. Or no, wait, no: the problem allows all numbers, including negative.\n\nWait, no, LeetCode's problem allows both positive and negative. So perhaps the deque approach works regardless of the numbers.\n\nWait, I'm not sure. But from the samples above, the approach seems to be working.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nCompute prefix sum.\n\nInitialize deque.\n\nFor each j in 0..n:\n\n   while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n\n       deque.pop()\n\n   deque.append(j)\n\n   while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target:\n\n       current_length = j - deque.popleft()\n\n       if current_length < min_length:\n\n           min_length = current_length\n\nSo the code would be along these lines.\n\nBut in the handling, after j is processed, and the condition is met for multiple i's, deque[0] will be removed until the condition is no longer met.\n\nBut wait, why remove from front? Because the earliest i is removed, which gives the longest possible window. But perhaps for j, a later i (further right) could provide a shorter window.\n\nHmm, I think this is a standard algorithm, and it's proven to be correct.\n\nSo, applying this to the problem, here are the steps for the function:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n\n2. Initialize a deque and a variable min_length as infinity.\n\n3. For each j in 0..len(prefix_sum)-1:\n\n   a. While the deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]], remove the last element.\n\n   b. Append j to deque.\n\n   c. While the deque is not empty and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= target:\n\n       i. current_length = j - deque[0]\n\n       ii. if current_length < min_length:\n\n           update min_length\n\n       iii. deque.popleft()\n\n4. After processing all j, if min_length is still infinity, return 0. Else return min_length.\n\nWait, but what about the prefix_sum len? For example, when j is 3, it represents the sum up to 3 elements (nums[0], nums[1], nums[2]), so the subarray would have to start after prefix_sum[i], which is i=0, meaning the subarray is nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], which is length 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's test another case:\n\nnums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target=7.\n\nPossible subarrays:\n\n[4,3] sum 7: length 2.\n\n[3,4]: sum7: length 2.\n\nBut maybe [2,4,3] sum 9: length3, but no, the minimal is 2.\n\nCompute prefix_sum:\n\nprefix_sum[0] =0\n\nprefix_sum[1]=2\n\nprefix_sum[2]=2+3=5\n\nprefix_sum[3]=5+1=6\n\nprefix_sum[4]=6+2=8\n\nprefix_sum[5]=8+4=12\n\nprefix_sum[6]=12+3=15.\n\nProcess each j:\n\nj=0: deque becomes [0]. Check j=0: 0-0=0 <7.\n\nj=1: prefix_sum[1]=2.\n\n   Add to deque. Deque [0,1].\n\n   Check: 2-0=2 <7: no.\n\nj=2: prefix_sum[j]=5.\n\n   deque[-1] is 1, prefix_sum[1]=2. 5>2, so add to deque.\n\n   Check: 5-0=5 <7: no.\n\nj=3: prefix_sum=6.\n\n   deque[-1] is 2:5<6, so add. deque [0,1,2,3].\n\n   Check:6-0=6 <7: no.\n\nj=4: prefix_sum=8.\n\n   deque[-1] is 3, prefix_sum=6 <8. append.\n\n   check 8-0=8 >=7: yes.\n\n   current_length j-0=4. min_length=4. pop 0.\n\n   Now, check 8 -1=7 >=7: yes. current_length=4-1=3.\n\n   update min_length to3. pop1.\n\n   Now, check 8-2=3 (wait, prefix_sum[deque[0]]=5: 8-5=3 >=7? No.\n\n   So stop.\n\nj=5: prefix_sum[j]=15.\n\n   deque is [2,3,4].\n\n   since 15 > prefix_sum[4]=8, it's added after deque processing.\n\n   Check 15-5 (parsed as prefix_sum[j]=15 - prefix_sum[deque[0]=2], which is 15-5=10 >=7: yes.\n\n   window length 5-2=3. min is already 3.\n\n   So, update min_length? No.\n\n   So pop deque[0] = 2.\n\n   Check next: 2 becomes 3. prefix_sum[j]-prefix_sum[3] is 15-6=9 >=7: yes.\n\n   window length 5-3=2. update min_length to 2.\n\n   Pop 3.\n\n   Now, deque has [4].\n\n   Check 15-8=7 >=7: yes.\n\n   window length 5-4=1. update min_length to1.\n\n   pop4.\n\n   deque is empty.\n\nSo after j=5:\n\nThe minimal length is 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the array, [4,3] makes 7, length 2. But according to the code, it's finding a subarray of length 1. Did I do a miscalculation?\n\nWait, j=5 corresponds to prefix_sum[5]=12, but the j=5 in the code is the 5th element (0-based) in prefix_sum, which is sum up to nums[4]. nums[4] is 4. So the subarray that gives sum 15-8=7 is from index 4 to 5-1=4? Or is this nums[4], which is 4.\n\nSo the sum is 4, but the target is 7. So 4 >=7 is false. So why does the code consider this as a valid window?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait wait, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, for j=4 in prefix_sum: which is sum up to nums[3], which is 2, so j=4 is prefix_sum=8.\n\nFor j=5: prefix_sum[j]=12, which is sum of nums[0] to nums[4], which is 2+3+1+2+4=12.\n\nSo when processing j=5, during the step:\n\nFor each j in prefix_sum:\n\nWe process j=5, prefix_sum[j]=15? Wait no: earlier prefix_sum computation was wrong.\n\nWait in the previous example, perhaps the nums are [2,3,1,2,4,3]. So len(prefix_sum) = len(nums)+1 =6+1=7.\n\nWait, let me recompute the prefix_sum correctly.\n\nnums: [2,3,1,2,4,3]\n\nprefix_sum[0] =0\n\nprefix_sum[1] =2\n\nprefix_sum[2]=2+3=5\n\nprefix_sum[3]=5+1=6\n\nprefix_sum[4]=6+2=8\n\nprefix_sum[5]=8+4=12\n\nprefix_sum[6]=12+3=15.\n\nSo for j=6: prefix_sum[j]=15.\n\nProcessing j=6:\n\n   Check deque after appending.\n\n   Deque before: For j=4: the deque after processing was [2,3,4].\n\n   Then j=5 (prefix_sum[j]=12) is added:\n\nIn step a:\n\n   compare 12 with deque's last (4): prefix_sum[4]=8 <12: so add to deque. Deque becomes [2,3,4,5].\n\n   Process condition:\n\n   12 -5=7 >=7: yes. window_length 5-2=3. Before, min_length was 3? Or 2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code works correctly, but in the previous step.\n\nSo for the j=5, the deque is [2,3,4,5]. Processing condition:\n\nwhile deque not empty and 12 - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >=7.\n\ndeque[0] is 2, prefix_sum[2]=5. 12-5=7 >=7.\n\nwindow_length=5-2=3.\n\nCompare with min_length so far, which is 2.\n\nNo change. Pop 2, deque becomes [3,4,5].\n\nNow, 12 - prefix_sum[3]=6 =6 >=7? 12-6=6 <7. So stop.\n\nSo min_length remains 2.\n\nNow, for j=6, prefix_sum[j]=15:\n\n   compare with deque's last (5, prefix_sum=12). 15>12: add to deque. [3,4,5,6].\n\n   now, check condition: 15-prefix_sum[3] =15-6=9 >=7.\n\n   window_length=6-3=3.\n\n   min_length is 2, remains.\n\n   pop 3.\n\n   now deque is [4,5,6].\n\n   check 15 - prefix_sum[4] =15-8=7 >=7: yes.\n\n   window_length=6-4=2.\n\n   min_length is 2, same as current.\n\n   pop4.\n\n   deque is [5,6].\n\n   check 15 - prefix_sum[5]=12: 3 <7: stop.\n\n   So min_length remains 2.\n\nThus, the correct output is 2.\n\nAh! So the code does correctly find the minimal length of 2.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the algorithm correctly finds the minimal length.\n\nSo, in the function, the approach is to compute the prefix sum, use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a monotonic increase of prefix sums. For each j, we add the current j to the deque after ensuring that the deque only contains smaller or equal prefix sums. Then, we check the front of the deque to see if the current j's prefix can form a subarray with sum >= target, and if so, compute the window length and update min_length.\n\nFinally, the code returns 0 if no such subarray is found, else the minimal length.\n\nSo, the code should implement this logic.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nInitialize the deque. Compute the prefix sum.\n\nNote: For cases when all prefix_sum are negative, the something could be wrong, but perhaps the code will handle correctly.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n1. All nums are negative: target >= something. Then, no solution.\n\n2. target is zero: need to find the minimal subarray with sum >=0. So subarrays that have sum positive.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the function should return 0 only if no such subarray exists.\n\nWait, no: down in the problem's initial statement, the function must return the minimal length subarray that meets the condition, or returns 0 if no such exists.\n\nWait, wait: target could be any positive or negative number?\n\nNo, the function is given as target is a parameter, but in the context, it's expected that target is an integer but could be anything.\n\nAt any rate, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, coding this:\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    m = len(nums)\n    prefix_sum = [0]*(m+1)\n    for i in range(m):\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]\n    from collections import deque\n    dq = deque()\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    for j in range(m+1):\n        # Process the deque to maintain order\n        while dq and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        dq.append(j)\n        # Check the front for possible subarray\n        while dq and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= target:\n            current_length = j - dq.popleft()\n            if current_length < min_length:\n                min_length = current_length\n    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0\n\nWait, but for j in 0..m, because prefix_sum has m+1 elements.\n\nWait, in the example where j runs up to m.\n\nTesting: in the case where target is 0, any window that has sum >=0, including empty? Or do we need to ensure that the subarray is non-empty.\n\nWait, the problem says 'subarray in nums'. So the subarray must have length >=1.\n\nIn the code, the current j is m+1, but for when j is 1, current_length can be 0, which would correspond to a subarray of length 0, but no.\n\nWait, because in the code, current_length is j - i.\n\ni is popped from the deque, which is an index in prefix_sum. So, for example, j=5, i=2, gives a subarray from i=2 to j=5.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nNo, it's from i to j-1. Because prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] is the sum from i to j-1 in nums.\n\nSo when j= i+1, the subarray from i to j-1 is just one element: the i-th element.\n\nSo if j - i=1, that's a subarray of length 1.\n\nThus, all current_length computed are j-i, which correspond to the number of elements. For example, if j=5 and i=4, the subarray is of length 1.\n\nThus, the code correctly only captures windows with at least 1 element.\n\nBut what about when the target is negative? For example, target = -5. Any subarray with sum >=-5 would include almost everything, but perhaps the minimal is 1.\n\nIn such case, the deque will be filled, and for j=0, prefix_sum[j] is 0, so the code will check all deque[0] for which 0 - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >=-5.\n\nBut since the code appends j=0 first, and for j=0, nothing is checked.\n\nWait, perhaps for target<=0, the code returns 1, but I think that depends.\n\nWait, actually, that depends on the data. Because any single element that is >= target would constitute a subarray of length 1.\n\nBut according to the logic, for j=1, the prefix_sum[j] = nums[0]. So for a single element, the code would pick it up only if nums[0] >= target.\n\nBut if target <=0, and any single element is >= target, the code will have a window length of 1.\n\nBut in such cases, there might be a shorter element, but the code will correctly find the earliest j where it's possible.\n\nWait, for target =-10:\n\nif any of the elements >=-10, the minimal subarray is 1.\n\nSo the code should correctly find it.\n\nBut to be certain, perhaps the code should handle all possible cases.\n\nThus, the code as written should be correct.\n\nBut let's think about some test cases.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nnums = [1, 1, 1], target=3.\n\nprefix_sum: 0,1,2,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nj=0: deque [0].\n\nNo condition check since 0-0=0 <3.\n\nj=1: sum=1.\n\nappend 1. Deque [0,1].\n\nCheck: 1-0=1 <3.\n\nj=2: sum=2.\n\nappend 2. deque [0,1,2].\n\nCheck 2-0=2 <3.\n\nj=3: sum=3.\n\nappend, so deque [0,1,2,3].\n\nCheck 3-0=3 >=3: window length 3.\n\npopleft 0, min_length=3.\n\nThen check 3-1=2 <3: stop.\n\nNo shorter window found, so return 3.\n\nBut wait, the subarray is [1,1,1], which is correct. The minimal length is 3.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [10,1,-14,5], target=5.\n\nWait: a minimal length of 1 (10,5,5) ?\n\nWait wait, the subarray can be of any length, as long as the sum is >=5.\n\nLooking at nums:\n\nnums[0]=10: meets the condition, so minimal length is 1.\n\nSo according to the code: j runs from 0 to 3 (since len(nums)=4, m=4).\n\nProcessing j=1: prefix_sum[1]=10.\n\nIn the initial processing:\n\ndeque is empty before appending.\n\nAfter j=1 is added to deque.\n\nThen, condition check: prefix_sum[1]-prefix_sum[deque[0]]=10 -0=10 >=5: yes.\n\ncurrent_length 1-0=1. min_length updated to1.\n\nThen, deque pops 0.\n\nBut since j=1, no other d Checklist the deque is empty.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns 1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, the code correctly implements the deque-based approach to find the minimal subarray with sum >= target.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the shortest contiguous subarray in a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to or greater than a given target. The solution should return the length of the shortest such subarray or 0 if no such subarray exists.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently involves using a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a monotonic queue of prefix sums. This allows us to quickly find the shortest subarray that meets the target sum condition. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. **Compute Prefix Sums**: First, we compute the prefix sums of the given array. The prefix sum array helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n\n2. **Monotonic Deque**: We use a deque to maintain indices of the prefix sums in such a way that the prefix sums are stored in increasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest starting index for each ending index that can form a valid subarray.\n\n3. **Window Checking**: For each ending index, we check if the current prefix sum minus the smallest prefix sum (front of the deque) meets or exceeds the target. If it does, we calculate the length of the subarray and update the minimum length if this subarray is shorter than previously found ones.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums, target):\n    prefix_sum = [0]\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix_sum.append(prefix_sum[-1] + num)\n    \n    dq = deque()\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    for j in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n        # Maintain deque in increasing order of prefix_sum\n        while dq and prefix_sum[j] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        dq.append(j)\n        \n        # Check if current prefix_sum can form a valid subarray\n        while dq and prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= target:\n            current_length = j - dq.popleft()\n            if current_length < min_length:\n                min_length = current_length\n    \n    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built to store cumulative sums of the input array. This allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n\n2. **Deque Maintenance**: The deque is maintained to store indices of prefix sums in increasing order. As we iterate through each possible ending index of the subarray, we ensure that the deque only contains indices where the prefix sums are in increasing order.\n\n3. **Window Length Calculation**: For each ending index, we check the smallest prefix sum from the front of the deque. If the difference between the current prefix sum and this smallest prefix sum meets the target, we compute the window length and update the minimum length if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, we efficiently find the shortest subarray that meets the target sum condition in linear time, making the solution both optimal and scalable for larger inputs.",
