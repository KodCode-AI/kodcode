  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I've got this problem where I need to find the shortest contiguous subarray in a list of integers such that the sum is at least a given target. If there's no such subarray, I should return 0. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the function is called shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target, and it takes nums and target as inputs. The goal is to find the minimum length of a subarray that meets or exceeds the target sum.\n\nWait, what if the array is empty? Or if all the numbers are negative? Oh right, the problem statement says the sum has to be at least target, so cases where nums is empty would have no subarray, but then the function returns 0. But I suppose for this problem, nums is a non-empty list, but I should handle cases where the sum can't reach the target.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. The brute force way would be to consider every possible subarray, calculate their sums, check if >= target, and track the minimum length. But that's O(n^2) time, which for large arrays could be slow.\n\nHmm, I remember there's a sliding window technique used for some subarray problems. That usually gives O(n) time, which is better. But does sliding window work here? The sliding window is often useful when the array has all positive numbers. Let me look at that.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't say positive numbers. So in cases where nums can have negative numbers, the sliding window approach might not work directly because expanding could either increase or decrease the sum. So that complicates things.\n\nSo maybe that approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, another approach is to use a prefix sum array. Sometimes, in problems where we have to find subarrays that meet certain sum conditions, we can compute the prefix sum and look for cases where the difference between two prefix sums meets the target.\n\nSo let me think about that. The prefix sum array S where S[0] = 0, S[1] = nums[0], S[2] = S[1] + nums[1], etc. Then, for any i < j, the sum of the subarray from i to j (exclusive) is S[j] - S[i]. If we can find pairs i < j such that S[j] - S[i] >= target and j-i is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but the prefix sum approach is more applicable for finding if a subarray exists that sums exactly to a target, and that's when the array has positive numbers, right? Because with positive numbers, the prefix sum is monotonically increasing, so for each j, you can look for i in earlier indices where S[j] - S[i] >= target.\n\nBut again, this relies on positive numbers. If the array has negative numbers, the prefix sum might not be increasing, which complicates matters. So maybe the sliding window approach can't be applied here.\n\nSo without the guarantee of positive numbers, perhaps we need to find another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each starting index i, find the smallest j such that the sum from i to j is >= target. Then track the minimal j-i+1 across all i.\n\nCalculating the sum from i to j each time could be O(n^2) in the worst case, but maybe there's a way to optimize it. For example, for each i, we can use a binary search approach on the prefix sum array for j. Wait, that only works if the prefix sum is increasing. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: since the goal is to find the smallest subarray, perhaps focusing on individual elements could help. For example, if there's an element >= target, that's a subarray of length 1. So we should immediately check if there's any such element; if yes, return 1.\n\nSo first, I can scan the array to see if any single element is >= target. If yes, return 1. That covers some edge cases quickly.\n\nIf not, then I need to look for longer subarrays. So starting from subarrays of length 2, and going up, check if any of them have sum >= target. As soon as I find the smallest possible length, return it. But that approach is again O(n^2).\n\nWait, but what's the problem constraints? I don't know. So, for a problem that's going to be tested for efficiency, perhaps an O(n^2) solution is not acceptable for large n. So I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the problem when all numbers are positive, sliding window could work. But since we might have negatives, maybe we can find a way by maintaining certain variables.\n\nWait, another approach is to compute the prefix sum and for each j, find the earliest i where S[j] - S[i] >= target, so we can find the smallest j - i that is possible.\n\nBut for this to work, the prefix sum array must be such that for each j, we can find the smallest i where S[i] is <= S[j] - target. Because if the prefix sum is increasing, we can perform a binary search for S[j] - target in the prefix sum up to j-1.\n\nWait, right! So the idea is:\n\nCompute the prefix sum S.\n\nFor each j, we want to find the smallest possible i (i <= j) such that S[j] - S[i] >= target. That is, S[i] <= S[j] - target.\n\nIf the prefix sum S up to j-1 is sorted, then for each j, we can perform a binary search to find the earliest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target, so that j - i is minimized.\n\nWait, but wait: the prefix sum only increases if all the numbers are positive. But if there are negative numbers, the prefix sum might not be sorted. So this approach is only valid for arrays with positive numbers.\n\nSo again, since the array can have any integers, including negatives and zeros, this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nHmm. So alternative idea: perhaps the problem requires that the sum of the subarray is sufficiently large, so even with negative elements; but the sum must be >= target.\n\nWait, but when you have negative elements, a longer subarray could have a higher sum than a shorter one. So the intuition that the minimal length is found near the target areas might not hold. For example, adding a negative number could cause the sum to dip.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal subarray would consist of a single element (if it's greater than or equal to the target). So that's the first case to check: any element >= target, return 1.\n\nIf that's not possible, then perhaps the minimal subarray can be found in a way that you have a certain window that adds up to >= target, but with as few elements as possible.\n\nAlternatively, think about dynamic programming: for each position, track the minimal subarray ending at that position which has sum >= target.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about how to solve this efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to use a deque to maintain a window of indices such that the prefix sum increases. So, using a deque to keep track of the indices in a way that S[i] for the deque is in increasing order. Then, for each j, we can remove from the front of the deque all indices i where S[j] - S[i] >= target, and record the j - i as possible candidates. Then, maintain the minimal length.\n\nWait, this is similar to how in the sliding window for maximum, etc., problems.\n\nBut how would that work with negatives? Let's work through an example.\n\nLet's say nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target = 7.\n\nThe prefix sum S is S[0] =0, S[1]=2, S[2]=5, S[3]=6, S[4] =8, S[5] =11, S[6] =14.\n\nWait, so for each j, starting from 1, we can look for i's in the deque which are <= S[j] - target.\n\nSo for j=1, S[j] is 2, target 7: 2 >=7 is false. So no.\n\nj=2, S[j]=5. 5 >=7 is false.\n\nj=3: S[j]=6, target 7, still no.\n\nj=4: S[j] =8. 8 >=7. So look for the latest i where S[i] <=8-7=1. Looking in S[0..4], the S values up to j=4 are S[0]=0, S[1]=2, S[2]=5, S[3]=6, S[4]=8.\n\nWait, looking for S[i] <=1. The only S[i] that is <=1 is S[0]=0.\n\nSo i=0, then subarray is from 0 to4: sum is 8-0=8, which meets target 7. Length is 4-0=4, which is also 5 elements? Wait, no. j-i is 4. The number of elements is j -i (since S[j] is the sum up to index j (exclusive), so the subarray from i to j-1 is of length j-1 -i +1= j- i.\n\nWait, but the j is being iterated in the prefix sum, which ranges from 1 to len(nums)+1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in 0-based indices for the nums array. Let me reindex.\n\nLet's say the prefix sum is an array of len(nums)+1, with S[0]=0, S[1] = nums[0], S[2] = S[1] + nums[1], etc.\n\nFor each j, from 1 to len(nums), S[j] = sum of first j elements.\n\nSo, for the subarray starting at i and ending at j-1 in nums, the sum is S[j] - S[i].\n\nSo, for each j, we need to find the smallest possible j-i such that S[j] - S[i] >= target.\n\nSo, for each j, find the earliest i (smallest i) such that S[i] <= S[j] - target. Then j-i is as large as possible, which is opposite of what we want. Wait wait, no: If i is as small as possible (earliest), then j-i is the maximum, but we're trying to find the minimal length, which is (j- i) as small as possible.\n\nWait, no: the length of the subarray is (end index - start index +1). Since in nums, it's from i to j-1 (j exclusive). So the length is (j-1) - i +1 = j- i. So to find the minimal length, we need to find the minimal (j - i), the smallest possible.\n\nSo, for each j, we want the earliest i that is as close to j as possible.\n\nSo for each j, we need to find the earliest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target, and i is <= j.\n\nSo the idea is for each j, to have a data structure that allows us to quickly find the smallest possible i such that S[i] <= S[j] - target, where i is before j.\n\nBut only if the S[i] are in a sorted order. If they are sorted, then we can perform a binary search.\n\nWait, so maybe we maintain a deque that keeps track of the indices i in increasing order, but also, S[i] is maintained in a way that allows us to find the earliest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target for the current j.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWhen the array has negative numbers, S[j] can decrease as j increases, which complicates maintaining a deque with certain order.\n\nHmm. So perhaps, for any j, the deque must contain the indices i such that S[i] is as small as possible, but also allows us to find the earliest i where S[i] is <= S[j] - target.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deque stores the i's such that S[i] is increasing.\n\nSo when processing a new j, we go through the deque and for each i in the deque, if S[j] - S[i] >= target, we can record j -i as a possible candidate for the minimal length, and then remove i's that meet this condition because any subsequent j's can't have a shorter length with these i's.\n\nWait, but for subsequent j's, perhaps waiting to process i's that meet S[j] - S[i] >= target could give a shorter length. Maybe we need to process in a way that ensures that the deque is ordered so that the earliest i's are considered first.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should look for similar problems or approaches.\n\nWait, I recall that in some problems, especially on Leetcode, the approach for the \"shortest subarray with sum at least K\" uses a deque to maintain a monotonic queue. Since in this problem, K can be any integer, including negative, the approach is a bit involved.\n\nWait, searching my mind for the solution, I remember that in the problem where the array can have negative numbers, a deque-based approach is used but requires some careful handling.\n\nFor example, the problem \"Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K\" is a known problem. Let me try to recall the approach.\n\nIn that problem, the key is to compute the prefix sum, and for each j, find the earliest i where S[j] - S[i] >= K. The minimal j-i is the answer.\n\nBut without the guarantee that the elements are positive, the prefix sum array may not be monotonic, so a binary search is not directly applicable. Instead, one approach is to use a deque to maintain a subset of i's such that S[i] is increasing.\n\nSo as we process j, when the prefix sum at j is less than the prefix sum at some i in the deque, we remove the previous i's because for future j's, j's position is further ahead, so any i's with higher S[i] than S[j] are no longer useful, as subtracting S[i] would give a smaller difference if future S[j] increases.\n\nWait, maybe I should think again: the deque keeps the i's in order of increasing S[i]. Since we want the earliest i with S[i] <= S[j] - target, perhaps the deque is maintained such that S[i] is always less than or equal to the S[i's] that come after in the deque.\n\nSo the deque is maintained in such a way that the S[i] of elements in the deque is in increasing order. So as we process each j, we first remove elements from the deque which have a S[i] >= S[j], because if a previous i' has S[i'] >= S[j], then any future element S[j'] > S[j] will subtract to get a higher sum. So i can be kept, but i' cannot be, so we can safely remove them.\n\nWait, that might be a way to maintain the deque.\n\nWait, let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array S, starting with S[0] = 0.\n\n2. Initialize a deque (double-ended queue) that will hold indices i in such a way that S[i] is increasing.\n\n3. Initialize the minimal length as infinity.\n\n4. For each j in 0 to len(S)-1 (assuming S is len(nums)+1? Or 0 to len(nums), perhaps I'm mixing indices here). Wait, perhaps for each j from 1 to len(S)-1 (since S[0] is 0, and S[j] for j>=1 is the sum up to the j-th element in nums).\n\nWait, perhaps the for loop should be for j from 1 to len(S) - 1 (where len(S) is len(nums) + 1). So j runs from 0 to len(nums).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck with the exact indices. Let's make sure I have this right.\n\nOkay, let me consider S as 0, s1, s2, ..., sn where s1 is nums[0], s2 = s1+nums[1], and so on.\n\nFor each j in 1 to len(S)-1, S[j] is the sum of the first j-1 elements in nums? Or is it the first j elements?\n\nWait, in programming terms, the prefix sum is usually defined as S[0] = 0, S[1] = nums[0], S[2] = nums[0] + nums[1], ..., S[n] = sum of first n elements of nums.\n\nSo when j is in 0 to n (inclusive if it's 1-based), for each j, we look for i in 0 to j-1 where S[i] <= S[j] - target.\n\nThe length of the subarray is j - i.\n\nThus, for each j, we want the smallest (j - i) such that S[i] <= S[j] - target.\n\nSo, back to the deque approach.\n\nWe can maintain a deque that contains the indices i in a way that S[i] is increasing. When we process j, for each i in the deque, if S[i] <= S[j] - target, we can compute the length and keep track of the minimal length. Then, we pop those i's since any future j' would have j' >= j, so i's which satisfy for j will also satisfy for j' but may allow for a longer length (thus not useful). So the minimal is found by the earliest j -i.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if for j, i gives a valid length, and when we move to a larger j', even if i is still in the deque, j' - i could be larger, which is worse (because we're looking for minimal length). So, for each j, after finding any i's that satisfy S[i] <= S[j] - target, we can record the j - i and then remove the i's from the deque so that they are not considered again for larger j's.\n\nTherefore, the steps could be:\n\nInitialize deque with i=0 (since S[0] is 0).\n\nFor j from 1 to len(S):\n\n   While deque is not empty and S[j] - S[deque[0]] >= target:\n       record the length j - deque.popleft()\n   \n   While S[j] is less than the S[i] of the last element in the deque:\n       pop the last element from the deque\n   \n   Add j to the deque\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSo for each j, first, check if the first element in the deque (i) gives S[j] - S[i] >= target. If so, then subtract, which gives j -i as a possible length. Since the deque is maintained to have increasing S[i], once an i in the front gives a valid sum, j can't get a better (smaller) length with smaller i's (since those earlier i's have smaller i and larger S[i], hence S[j] - S[i] is smaller. Wait, no: if we have i's with S[i] <= S[j] - target, then as we have a deque of S[i] increasing, the first i that meets S[i] <= S[j] - target is the best candidate in terms of earliest i, but wait: the earlier i has a higher S[i], because the deque is in increasing S[i]. So no, the later i's have lower S[i]. Because the deque is maintained as S[i] increasing.\n\nWait, wait, the deque is maintained as indices in the order of their S[i] increasing. So the earlier elements in the deque have smaller S[i].\n\nSo when for j, we have S[j] - S[i] >= target, since i is in the deque in order of increasing S[i], the first i (front of deque) that satisfies S[i] <= S[j] - target would be the earliest possible, but j -i is the longest possible since i is as small as possible. So perhaps I got this backwards.\n\nSo for example, if the deque has i's in the order of their indices, so i increases, and S[i] is increasing.\n\nWhen processing j, for each i in the deque:\n\nIf S[j] - S[i] >= target, then the length is j -i.\n\nSince the first i (the earliest in the deque, smallest i) is considered first, which would give the maximum j -i.\n\nWait, but that's the opposite of what we want. Because if we are looking for the minimal j -i, the earlier i's would give larger j -i. But wait, no, the earliest i is smaller, so j -i is larger for the same j.\n\nWait, so perhaps for each j, once we find that S[j] - S[deque[0]] >= target, we can calculate the length (j - deque[0]), which is a candidate, but not the minimal possible for that j. Because any i's after deque[0] would have larger S[i], so S[j] - S[i] is smaller, possibly still >= target. So those i's would give a smaller j - i.\n\nWait, so perhaps instead of stopping at the first i in deque that meets the condition, we need to check all i's in deque that meet the condition and find the smallest j -i.\n\nBut that would take O(n) time in worst case, and with O(n^2) overall.\n\nBut that's not efficient.\n\nSo, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deque stores i's in a way that allows us to perform a binary search for the condition S[i] <= S[j] - target. Then, for j, the minimal length is found by the latest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target.\n\nWait, that would require that the S[i] in the deque are increasing. So for each j, the deque is a list of i's with S[i] in increasing order. So for each j, you can perform a binary search on the deque's S[i] to find the largest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target. That's because S[j] is fixed; so any i's after that point in the deque have larger S[i], so not meeting the condition.\n\nHmm, but the buffer of S[i] is in a deque which may have variable order, but perhaps it's maintained in a way that S[i] is strictly increasing.\n\nThus, for each j, the deque is a list of i's such that S[i_1] < S[i_2] < ... S[i_k], and all of these are less than S[j], perhaps?\n\nWait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I can try to look for the code.\n\nWait, I remember that for this problem, the standard approach is to use a deque to maintain a window of potential i's, ensuring that S[i] is monotonically increasing. Then, for each j, as long as the sum S[j] - S[i] is >= target, we can record the length j -i and possibly update the minimal length.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite.\n\nSo let's try to step through the solution with an example.\n\nTake nums = [2, -1, 2], target = 3.\n\nThe prefix sum S is [0, 2, 1, 3].\n\nWe can see that the minimal subarray is [2,-1,2] with sum 3, length 3.\n\nBut is there a smaller subarray? Like the last two elements sum to 1, which is less than target. Hmm.\n\nSo, for j=3, S[j] is 3.\n\nWe want to find i in the deque such that S[j] - S[i] >=3 \u2192 S[i] <=0.\n\nLooking at the deque:\n\nThe deque starts as [0].\n\nProcessing j=1, S[1]=2.\n\nThe deque has S[0]=0. So 2-0 >=3? No.\n\nThen, since S[1] is greater than S[0], we don't add 1 to the deque until perhaps the other elements are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the deque should only contain the i's that have S[i] <= S[j]. So when processing j, we can remove any i's from the end of the deque where S[i] >= S[j], because adding j to the deque has a smaller S[j], so those i's can't be part of any optimal solution for future j's.\n\nHmm, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps again:\n\nInitialize deque with 0.\n\nmin_length = infinity.\n\nCompute prefix sum S.\n\nfor j in range(1, len(S)):\n\n   while deque is not empty and S[j] - S[deque[0]] >= target:\n\n       min_length = min(min_length, j - deque.popleft())\n\n   while deque and S[j] < S[deque[-1]]:\n\n       deque.pop()\n\n   deque.append(j)\n\nSo, for each j, first check and pop from front any i's which, when S[j] - S[i] >= target. Record the length of j-i as a candidate.\n\nThen, pop from the end of the deque any i's where S[j] is less than S[i]. Because for future j's, S[j] will be higher than the current j, so any i that has higher S[i] than j will not be useful because S[j'] - S[i] would be smaller than S[j] - S[i].\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for i's with larger S[i], when j increases, S[j'] could be such that S[j'] - S[i] might not meet the condition if S[j] was also smaller than S[i].\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in code.\n\nSo for each j, the deque currently contains a list of i's where their S[i] is increasing. Now, before adding the current j to the deque, we need to remove any i's from the end of the deque where S[i] >= S[j], because those i's can't be part of the minimal solution for future j's.\n\nBecause any future j' > j would have S[j'] >= S[j]. If S[j'] is higher, and for some such j', subtracting S[i] (where S[i] >= S[j] implies S[i] could be <= S[j'] - target). So but since i is behind j, j' would be after j.\n\nSo for j', the earliest i's (at the front of the deque) may satisfy S[j'] - S[i] >= target. So, wait, perhaps this isn't directly applicable.\n\nI think the correct approach is that for the deque, we only keep i's with S[i] that is strictly less than the current S[j], thus ensuring that the deque remains increasing. So when we process j, any i's in the deque with S[i] > S[j] are removed (from the end), because they can't be the optimal i for any future j's since S[j...] may be even higher.\n\nWait, no. For future j's, if S[j'] is increased, and you have an i which has S[i] >= S[j], then for S[j'] - S[i] to be >= target, S[j'] - S[i] must be >= target. But perhaps j' is far ahead of j, so j' - i is a longer length.\n\nWait, but minimal length is what we're after. So for a given j, minimal length is found by the earliest i (which is the smallest i) possible. So if the deque is in order of S[i] being increasing, the earliest possible i is the front, but that i has the smallest S[i], so the sum is the largest.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is confused. Let's think of this in terms of when the deque is used for maintaining S[i] in increasing order.\n\nLet me go back to that example: nums = [2, -1, 2], target=3.\n\nCompute prefix sum S: [0,2,1,3]\n\nSo j runs from 1,2,3.\n\nInitialize deque with 0.\n\nmin_length = infinity.\n\nProcessing j=1 (S[j]=2):\n\nCheck while deque not empty and 2 - S[0]= 2 >=3? 2 >=3? No. So no popping.\n\nThen, check if S[j] < S[deque[-1]]: S[1]=2. deque has [0], S[0]=0. So 2 is not less than 0, so we don't pop. add 1 to deque: deque becomes [0,1].\n\nProcessing j=2 (S[j]=1):\n\nFirst, check while deque not empty and S[j] - S[deque[0]] >=3: 1-0=1 <3\u2192 no.\n\nThen, check if S[j] < S[deque[-1]]:1 < S[1]=2. So yes, we remove 1 from deque. Now, queue is [0]. Now, S[j]=1 is compared to S[0]=0. 1>0? Yes, so add j=2 to deque: deque becomes [0, 2].\n\nProcessing j=3 (S[j] = 3):\n\nCheck while deque not empty and 3 - S[0]=3 >=3 \u2192 yes. So 3-3=0 >=3 \u2192 yes. Wait 3-3? No: the sum is 3 - S[deque[0]] =3-0=3 \u22653 \u2794 yes. So record the length: j - deque.popleft() \u2192 3-0 =3. min_length becomes 3. Now deque is empty.\n\nWait, in the code I wrote earlier, that would have popped the 0, but that might have made deque empty.\n\nWait, but in this case, the deque is empty after popping, so we proceed.\n\nThen, because deque is now empty, we proceed to add j=3 to the deque.\n\nNow, the deque has [3].\n\nSo the minimal length found is 3, which matches our example.\n\nThus, in this case, the code would correctly find the minimal length.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this example correctly.\n\nLet me take another example:\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\ntarget = 10.\n\nExpected minimal length: subarrays [5] is 5 which is 5 <10. Subarrays of length 4: sum 2+3+4+5=14. Or wait, no: what's the minimal length. Let me compute all possible lengths.\n\nprefix sum S: [0,1,3,6,10,15]\n\nj runs from 1 to 5.\n\nInitialize deque [0].\n\nprocessing j=1 (S[j]=1):\n\nCheck S[j] - S[deque[0]] =1-0=1 <10. No pop.\n\nThen, check S[j] < deque[-1]'s S? 1 <0? No. So deque remains [0], add 1 \u2192 deque [0,1].\n\nj=2, S[j]=3:\n\nCheck 3 - S[0]=3 <10 \u2192 no pop.\n\nCheck if S[j]=3 < S[deque[-1]]=1? No. So add to deque \u2192 [0,1,2].\n\nj=3, S[j]=6: \n\n6 -0=6 <10. So no pop.\n\nCheck 6 <3? No, add j=3. Deque becomes [0,1,2,3].\n\nj=4: S[j]=10.\n\n10 -0=10 \u226510. So pop 0 \u2192 length 4 -0=4. min_length becomes 4.\n\nThen, check if deque is empty: deque now has [1,2,3]. Then, S[j] - S[1] =10-1=9 <10? So stop. So at this point, the minimal length is 4.\n\nBut wait, for j=4, when we popped 0 and checked, there's none in the deque that have S[i] where 10 - S[i] >=10. Because S[i] must be <=0. None of the other i's (1,2,3) have S <=0.\n\nSo after j=4, minimal is 4.\n\nNow deque becomes [1,2,3,4].\n\nWait, no: during the processing of j=4:\n\nafter popping 0, while deque is not empty:\n\ncheck S[j] - S[deque[0]] \u219210-1=9 <10: no.\n\nThen, check S[j] <= S[deque[-1]]: 10 < S[j=3] (what is S[j=4] is 10, S[3] is 6. So no. So add j=4.\n\nThen, next j=5.\n\nS[j]=15.\n\nNow, S[j] - S[deque[0]] =15-1=14 >=10: yes.\n\nSo record length 5-1=4. Current min is 4.\n\nThen, pop 1 from deque.\n\nNow, check if 15 - S[2]=15-3=12 >=10: yes. Record 5-2=3, which is better. So min becomes3.\n\nPop 2. Now, deque has [3,4].\n\nCheck 15 - S[3] =15-6=9 <10: no.\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nSo the minimal length is 3.\n\nBut what subarray is this? i=2, j=5: subarray is nums[2:5] (indices 2,3,4 for nums).\n\nWait, nums is [1,2,3,4,5], indices 0-4. So nums[2:5] is [3,4,5], sum is 3+4+5=12 which is >=10. So length is 3.\n\nBut wait, j=5 in S corresponds to sum 15, which is after considering all the elements.\n\nThus, the minimal length is found correctly.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this example.\n\nAnother example: nums = [10, 2, 3], target=14.\n\nThe subarrays:\n\n[10] sum 10 <14.\n\n[10,2] sum 12 <14.\n\n[10,2,3] sum15 >=14. length 3.\n\n[2,3] sum5 <14.\n\n[2] same.\n\nSo minimal length is 3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nS = [0,10,12,15]\n\nDeque starts with 0.\n\nj=1:\n\nS[j]=10-0=10 <14 \u2192 no pop.\n\nAdds j=1. Deque [0,1].\n\nj=2:\n\nS=12.\n\nCheck 12 -0=12 <14 \u2192 no.\n\nAdd j=2. Deque [0,1,2].\n\nj=3:\n\nS=15.\n\n15-0=15 >=14 \u2192 pop 0. Length 3-0=3. min_length=3.\n\nNow deque is [1,2].\n\nNow, 15 - S[1]=12+2=15-10=5 <14? No\u2192 5 is less than 14.\n\nWait, 15-10=5 <14 \u2192 no? Wait wait, 15-10=5 \u2192 5 >=14? No.\n\nSo then, no popping.\n\nProceed to checking whether to add j=3: S[3]=15.\n\nDeque[-1] is 2, S[2]=12 <15: so deque remains [1,2], prepend j=3?\n\nWait, wait, no.\n\nThe while loop pops any i's where S[j] < S[i], but in this case, S[j]=15, S[deque[-1]]=12. 15 >=12. So we add j=3 to deque: now deque becomes [1,2,3].\n\nThus, the minimal length is 3.\n\nSo the code works here.\n\nAnother test case: nums has negative numbers. Let's see nums=[-1, 4, -1, 5], target=8.\n\nPrefix sum S: [0,-1,3,2,7].\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitialize deque with 0.\n\nj=1: S[j]=-1.\n\nCheck for S[j] - S[0] =-1-0=-1 >=8? No.\n\nCheck S[j]<S[deque[-1]]: yes. Because S[j]=-1 < S[0]=0. So we pop 0 and add j=1? Because in the code, if S[j] < last element of deque, we pop the end and so on.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nwhile deque and S[j] < S[deque[-1]]: \n\nSo for j=1, S[j] is -1.\n\nS[deque[-1]] is S[0]=0. So S[j] (-1) < 0? Yes. So we pop 0 from deque. Now deque is empty.\n\nAdd j=1 to deque.\n\nProcessing j=2: S[j]=3.\n\nCheck S[j] - S[deque[0]] =3 - (-1) =4 >=8? No.\n\nThen, add j=2 because S[j]=3 >= S[deque[-1]]= -1.\n\nDeque is [1,2].\n\nj=3: S[j]=2.\n\nS[j] - S[deque[0]] =2 - (-1) = 3 <8 \u2192 no.\n\nThen, S[j]=2 >= S[deque[-1]]=3? 2 >=3 \u2192 no. So pops from the end. So deque[-1] is 2, with S=3. Since 2<3, pop 2. Now deque is [1].\n\nIs deque not empty and S[j] =2 < S[1]=-1? 2 >-1 \u2192 no. So add j=3 to deque. Deque is [1,3].\n\nj=4: S[j]=7.\n\nCheck S[j] - S[deque[0]] =7 - (-1) =8 >=8 \u2192 yes. So we add the length 4-1=3. min_length=3.\n\nThen, pop 1 from deque. Now deque is [3].\n\nCheck S[j] =7 - S[3]=2 \u2192 7-2=5 <8 \u2192 no.\n\nSo processing j=4: we get a minimal length of3.\n\nWhich corresponds to the subarray starting at index 1 (s1=-1) and ending at s4=7. The sum is 7 - (-1)=8. The elements in nums are [4, -1,5], sum 8, which is >=8. Length is 3.\n\nSo minimal length is 3. The code handles this correctly.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum S, with S[0] = 0.\n\n2. Initialize deque with 0.\n\n3. Initialize min_length as infinity.\n\n4. For each j in 1 to len(S)-1:\n\n   a. While deque is not empty and S[j] - S[deque[0]] >=target:\n\n        i. Calculate length j - deque.popleft()\n\n        ii. Update min_length if this length is smaller.\n\n   b. While deque is not empty and S[j] <= S[deque[-1]]:\n\n        i. Remove the last element from deque.\n\n   c. Append j to deque.\n\n5. At the end, if min_length is still infinity, return 0. Otherwise return min_length.\n\nBut wait, I think the code in step 4a shouldn't popleft right away. Because if you have a deque with multiple elements, each of which could contribute to a longer length, but the only the first one. Or does popping from the front right when the condition is met ensure that we find the minimal j-i?\n\nWait, in the example where j=2 and deque has [0,1], say, and S[j] is such that S[j] - S[0] >= target, but S[j]-S[1] is also >= target but gives a smaller length. So by popping the 0, possibly miss the 1 which could give a smaller length.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the order in the deque.\n\nIn the deque, the i's are ordered such that S[i] is in increasing order. So the front of the deque has the smallest S[i].\n\nThus, for a given j, processing i's in order from front. The first i (front) is the earliest, and thus gives the largest length j-i.\n\nBut since what we want is the minimal j-i, we need to keep the i's as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a mistake. Because the front of the deque has the smallest i, so j-i is largest.\n\nHence, when processing j, if S[j] - S[i] >= target, the current i is as far left as possible, thus j -i is the largest. So if j -i is the current candidate, but perhaps there's an i' later (with larger i) which still satisfies S[j]-S[i']>= target, and j -i' is smaller, which is better.\n\nThus, the minimal j-i may not be found at the first i.\n\nIn the first approach, where we pop all i's that meet S[j] -S[i] >= target, we can potentially miss shorter lengths.\n\nWait, because in the while loop, once we start popping i's, the first i gives j - i, but any i's later in the deque may have larger values, thus smaller j -i lengths.\n\nWait, but no: for the deque, the i's are in order of increasing S[i], such that S[i1] < S[i2] < ... So if S[j] - S[i] >= target occurs for i1 (front of deque), it may occur for i2, i3, etc., but j-i could be larger or smaller.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps the approach is flawed, and that instead of popping immediately upon finding an i, we should use a binary search to find the largest i where S[i] <= S[j] - target, and thus have the smallest j -i.\n\nBut then, the code would be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is too greedy and may miss better candidates, as described.\n\nTo see, let's take an example where not processing all i's would miss a better candidate.\n\nSuppose nums = [1, 1, 5], target=7.\n\nprefix sum S: [0,1,2,7]\n\nj runs 1,2,3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nAt j=1, S=1:\n\n1<=0?- no.\n\nqueue is [0,1].\n\nAt j=2, S=2.\n\nWe check queue[0]=0: 2 -0=2 <7 \u2192 no.\n\nAfter that, add j=2.\n\nAt j=3, S[j]=7.\n\n7-0=7 >=7 \u2192 record length 3, pop 0.\n\n7-1=6 <7 \u2192 no.\n\nProcessing the deque becomes [1,2], add 3.\n\nSo min_length is 3.\n\nBut wait, the subarray at i=1, j=3 is nums[1:3], sum 1+5=6 <7?\n\nNo. Wait, in the example, S[j]-S[i] =7 -1=6 <7? So would the minimal length be found as 3, but is there a possible subarray?\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the code overestimates.\n\nBecause the minimal length subarray is [5], but it only sum 5<7. So the only subarray that sums >=7 is nums[0:3], which sums 7, the length is 3.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns 3.\n\nWait, what about nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target = 7.\n\nCompute the prefix sum:\n\nS0=0, S1=2, S2=5, S3=6, S4=8, S5=11, S6=14.\n\nProcessing j from 1 to 6.\n\nAt j=1, S[j]=2.\n\nCheck 2-0=2 <7\u2192 no. Add 1 to deque: [0,1].\n\nj=2, S=5.\n\n5-0=5 <7\u2192 no. Add 2.\n\nj=3, S=6.\n\n6-0=6 <7\u2192 no. Add3.\n\nj=4, S=8.\n\n8-0=8 >=7\u2192 record length 4 (4-0), pop 0.\n\nDeque empty now: add 4.\n\nmin_length is 4.\n\nBut wait, is there a better subarray? For example, j=5: S=11. Looking for i=4: 11-8=3 <7\u2192 no. But i=5: S[j] - S[i]=?\n\nNot applicable yet. Or wait, the subarray is j=5; S[j] is 11, so S[j]-S[i] =11 - S[i]. So are there any i's <5 where S[i] <=11-7=4. S[i] needs to be <=4.\n\nIn deque before j=5: [4]. S[4] is8>4\u2192 so no.\n\nProcessing j=5:\n\nCheck if 11-8=3 >=7 \u2192 no. \u2192 no pop.\n\nAdd j=5 to deque (because S[5]=11 is larger than S[4]=8. So deque becomes [4,5].\n\nProcessing j=6, S[j]=14.\n\n14 -8=6 <7\u2192 no. \n\n14 -11=3 <7\u2192 no.\n\nSo min_length remains4.\n\nWait, but in this case, the deque after processing j=4 is [4].\n\nAt j=6, deque is [4,5].\n\nWe check 14 - S[4] =14-8=6 <7\u2192 not enough.\n\nThen, proceed.\n\nSo according to the code, the minimal length is4.\n\nBut what are the possible subarrays that meet the sum: the subarray from0 to4 is 2+3+1+2+4=12, which is greater than7 and has length5, which is longer than4. Or i=0 and j=4: sum8>7, length4. So code's output is correct.\n\nWait, but another possible subarray is from i=1 to j=4: sum3+1+2+4=10>7, length4.\n\nThus, the code correctly found the minimal possible length.\n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nBecause in all the examples, the code seems to handle the problem correctly. So perhaps the idea is:\n\n- For each j, process the deque to find the earliest i (smallest i) where S[i] <= S[j] - target. Because these i's have the earliest indices, so j -i is the maximum possible. Thus, the minimal j -i requires the latest i possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Because in the deque, when j is processed, adding j to the deque only if S[j] is less than the S[i's] in the deque.\n\nWait, but the deque is maintained in a way that S[i's] are increasing. So the first i (front) has the smallest S[i], and the last has the largest. When we process j, we can have S[j] as something which may require the minimal (j-i).\n\nThus, the initial approach of popping i's when S[j] - S[i] >= target is correct. It records the possible j -i, which is the minimal j-i.\n\nThus, perhaps the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, to write the code.\n\nBut first, I need to handle cases where target is zero or negative.\n\nBecause if target is negative, any non-empty subarray's sum could be >= target. But we're to find the minimal possible subarray with sum >= target. The minimal length possible is 1 if there's any single element >= target.\n\nThus, in the code, perhaps before processing, scan the array for any element >= target, and if found, return 1.\n\nSimilarly, if target is zero, any subarray (even all elements sum to something, which must be >=0) may be considered. But the minimal length is 1 if any single element is non-negative.\n\nThus, we can add a step at the beginning to check all elements to see if any is >= target. If yes, return 1.\n\nIn terms of the code, let's outline it.\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    if target <= 0:\n        # Check if any single element is >= target (if target <=0, any element >=0)\n        # because sum of one element can be >= target.\n        for num in nums:\n            if num >= target:\n                return 1\n    else:\n        # Check for target>0\n        for num in nums:\n            if num >= target:\n                return 1\n    \n    # Now, proceed with the deque approach.\n    prefix = [0]\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    dq = deque()\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    dq.append(0)\n    \n    for j in range(1, len(prefix)):\n        # First, while the current element in the front of deque meets S[j] - S[i] >= target\n        while dq and prefix[j] - prefix[dq[0]] >= target:\n            min_length = min(min_length, j - dq.popleft())\n        \n        # Now, maintain the deque: remove all elements from the end where S[j] <= S[i], and add j\n        while dq and prefix[j] <= prefix[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        dq.append(j)\n    \n    if min_length != float('inf'):\n        return min_length\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, but in the initial for loop for checking if any single element is >= target, perhaps it's more efficient to process the entire array before. But what if the target is positive?\n\nYes, as for the initial code, we only need to check if there's any num >= target.\n\nBut perhaps a single element can't reach target. For example, target=5, and nums is [4,4,4]. Then, the minimal subarray is length 2, 4+4=8>=5.\n\nThus, our initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nThus, the code needs to first scan the array to see if any single element is >= target. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, proceed with the deque approach.\n\nBut when target is negative, the initial check is general, as any single element >= target.\n\nWait, but in the case target=3, and nums are all 2's, the shortest subarray is a single 2 only if 2 >=3? No. Wait, 2 isn't>=3. So, no, that when target=3, a single 2 is not >=3, so proceed to the deque.\n\nSo, the initial step is correct.\n\nThus, the code is ok.\n\nLet me test again with nums = [1, 1, 5], target=7.\n\nInitial step: check if any single element is >=7. The elements are 1,1,5; all are less than7\u2192 no. So proceed.\n\nCompute prefix S: [0,1,2,7].\n\nProcessing j=1:\n\nprefix[j] - prefix[0]=1-0=1<7\u2192 no.\n\nadd j=1 to deque: [0,1].\n\nj=2:\n\n2-0=2<7\u2192 no.\n\nadd j=2: [0,1,2].\n\nj=3:\n\n7-0=7 >=7\u2192 record 3-0=3.\n\npop 0\u2192 deque becomes [1,2].\n\n7-1=6 <7\u2192 no. So min_length=3.\n\nBut in the actual array, the sum is achieved by [1+1+5]=7, which is length3.\n\nNo shorter subarray.\n\nThus, the code correctly returns3.\n\nBut wait, the target is7, any single element <=7. So the code returns3 because there are no elements >=7.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [3, 1, 1], target=3. Then, the minimal is 1.\n\nInitial step returns1.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother case: nums = [1, 3, 2], target=3.\n\nInitial step finds 3 in nums, returns1.\n\nAnother case: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], target=6.\n\nprefix sum: [0,1,3,6, 10].\n\nInitial step checks. 1<6, 2<6, etc.\n\nBut wait, the initial check is for elements >= target. 4 >=6?No.\n\nHmm:\n\nnums[2] =3 <6, nums[3]=4 <6.\n\nSo initial check returns nothing.\n\nThus, proceed.\n\nAt j=1, S[j]=1: No.\n\nj=2: S=3\u21923<6.\n\nj=3: S=6.\n\nCheck 6-0=6 >=6\u2192 record length3.\n\nPop 0.\n\nAfter that, deque is [1,2,3].\n\nThen, 6 -1=5 <6\u2192 no.\n\nSo the minimal length is3, which is correct.\n\nBut alternative, the sum reaches6: subarray [1,2,3] from index0 to2, sum=3+... Maybe no\u2014no, the sum is6, which is target.\n\nLength3.\n\nBut another possible subarray is [3,2,1], but not here.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle the problems.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the shortest contiguous subarray in a list of integers such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to or greater than a given target. If no such subarray exists, we return 0.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Check for Single Element**: If any single element in the array is greater than or equal to the target, the answer is immediately 1 because a single element forms the shortest possible subarray.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute the prefix sum array to efficiently calculate sums of subarrays. The prefix sum at index `i` represents the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.\n3. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Use a deque to maintain indices of the prefix sum array in a way that ensures the prefix sums are in increasing order. This helps efficiently find the shortest subarray that meets the target sum.\n4. **Sliding Window Technique**: For each index in the prefix sum array, check the deque to find the smallest index where the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the deque's front meets the target. If it does, update the minimum length and remove the front index from the deque. Maintain the deque to ensure it only contains valid indices for future computations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_subarray_with_sum_at_least_target(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    # Check if any single element meets or exceeds the target\n    for num in nums:\n        if num >= target:\n            return 1\n    \n    # Compute the prefix sum array\n    prefix = [0]\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix.append(prefix[-1] + num)\n    \n    min_length = float('inf')\n    dq = deque()\n    dq.append(0)  # Initialize the deque with the first index\n    \n    for j in range(1, len(prefix)):\n        # Check if the current prefix sum minus the front of the deque meets the target\n        while dq and prefix[j] - prefix[dq[0]] >= target:\n            current_length = j - dq.popleft()\n            if current_length < min_length:\n                min_length = current_length\n        \n        # Maintain the deque to ensure it's in increasing order of prefix sums\n        while dq and prefix[j] <= prefix[dq[-1]]:\n            dq.pop()\n        \n        dq.append(j)\n    \n    if min_length != float('inf'):\n        return min_length\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The function first scans the array to see if any single element meets the target. If found, it returns 1 immediately.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array is built to quickly compute the sum of any subarray using the difference of two prefix sums.\n3. **Deque Usage**: The deque maintains indices such that the corresponding prefix sums are in increasing order. This allows efficient checking of subarray sums against the target.\n4. **Sliding Window**: For each index `j`, the function checks the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sums at the front of the deque. If this difference meets the target, it records the length and updates the minimum length. The deque is then maintained to ensure it remains in the correct order for future checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray with the required sum, leveraging the deque to maintain optimal indices and reduce unnecessary computations.",
