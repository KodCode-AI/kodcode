  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given an unsorted array of integers and a positive integer k. The goal is to return the maximum number of distinct elements in any continuous subarray of size k. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. For example, in the first sample input [1,2,1,3,4,3] with k=3, the function returns 3. So I guess for the subarrays of size 3 like [1,2,1], the distinct elements are 2; but maybe there's a subarray like [2,1,3] which has 3 distinct elements. Oh right, so I need to slide a window of size k across the array and for each window, compute the number of distinct elements, then find the maximum among all windows.\n\nWait, but what if k is 0? Oh, looking at the sample, when k=0, the output is 0. So I should handle that edge case first.\n\nAlso, what if the array is empty? Like the sample where the input is empty and k=3, the output is 0. Similarly, if the array's length is less than k, then the function should return 0, I suppose.\n\nSo the first step is to check if k is 0 or the array is empty or its length is less than k. In those cases, return 0.\n\nNow, for the general case where k is valid.\n\nI think sliding window approach would work here. Since the window is of fixed size k, perhaps it's easier than handling a variable window. But how to count the distinct elements efficiently in each window.\n\nLet's consider some approaches.\n\nOne approach is the brute-force method: for each starting index i, take the subarray from i to i+k-1, convert it into a set, get the size of the set, and track the maximum. But this would be O(n*k) time complexity, which might not be efficient for very large n (like 10^5 or something), but in the given problem, I'm not sure the constraints because it's a code submission question. Wait, the given examples are small, so maybe the test cases aren't too big, but still, I should aim for an efficient solution.\n\nAlternatively, a sliding window approach using a hash map or dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element can help. The idea is that as the window slides, we add the new element and remove the one that's leaving the window.\n\nLet me outline this approach.\n\nInitialize a dictionary to keep counts of each element in the current window. We'll also have a variable to track the number of distinct elements in the current window.\n\nThen, for the first window (from index 0 to k-1), we populate the dictionary by iterating through each element, incrementing counts and keeping track of the distinct count.\n\nAfter processing the first window, we check if the current distinct count is the maximum so far.\n\nThen, we slide the window by one each time. For each new position, we remove the leftmost element (the one that's no longer in the window) from the dictionary and add the new element on the right.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the window size is fixed. So perhaps it's better to process each window individually, but for efficiency, perhaps the sliding window approach with a hash will work better.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Handle edge cases: if k is 0, return 0. If the array is empty or length is less than k, return 0.\n\n2. Initialize a dictionary called count_map, which keeps track of the number of times each element appears in the current window.\n\n3. Initialize variables: left pointer at 0, max_distinct = 0, current_distinct = 0.\n\n4. Iterate through each right pointer from 0 to len(nums) -1.\n\n   For each element at right:\n\n   a. If it's not in count_map or count_map[nums[right]] ==0, then current_distinct +=1.\n   b. Increment count_map[nums[right]] by 1.\n\n   Then, while the window size (right - left +1) exceeds k, we need to remove the leftmost element.\n\n   So:\n\n   while (right - left +1) >k:\n       element = nums[left]\n       count_map[element] -=1\n       if count_map[element] == 0:\n           current_distinct -=1\n       left +=1\n\n   After adjusting the window, if the window size is exactly k, then check if current_distinct is greater than max_distinct. If yes, update max_distinct.\n\nWait, but why the while loop? Because as the window exceeds size k, we need to keep moving left until the window is exactly size k.\n\nBut for each right, we have:\n\nIf the current window size is <=k, then it's okay. Otherwise, we need to shrink the window.\n\nBut wait, isn't k fixed? So perhaps another approach is to process all elements, building the count_map as we go, and whenever the window reaches size k, we process it.\n\nAlternatively, the sliding window approach for fixed window size can be optimized.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to just think in terms of adding each element and then, once the window is larger than k, remove the leftmost elements until the window is size k.\n\nBut in code, how would I handle that? Because for each right step, I can add the element, and when the window size exceeds k, I start removing.\n\nWait, another way: for each window, the start is left, the end is left + k -1. So for each left from 0 to n -k:\n\nBut then, for each left, process the window from left to left+k-1. But that would be O(nk) time in the worst case, unless we can find a way to compute the distinct count in O(1) per window by keeping track of the previous state.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial idea of using a hash map and sliding window pointers to keep the window size exactly k, thus maintaining the current number of distinct elements.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize count_map as an empty dictionary.\n\nleft = 0\n\nmax_distinct = 0\n\nfor right in range(len(nums)):\n\n   num = nums[right]\n\n   if num in count_map:\n\n       if count_map[num] == 0:\n\n           current_distinct +=1\n\n       count_map[num] +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       count_map[num] = 1\n\n       current_distinct +=1\n\n   # Now check if the window size is >k, if so, move the left\n\n   while right - left +1 > k:\n\n       left_num = nums[left]\n\n       count_map[left_num] -=1\n\n       if count_map[left_num] ==0:\n\n           current_distinct -=1\n\n       left +=1\n\n   # Now, after adjusting, if the window size is k, update max_distinct\n\n   window_size = right - left +1\n\n   if window_size ==k:\n\n       if current_distinct > max_distinct:\n\n           max_distinct = current_distinct\n\nWait, but maybe after shrinking, the window is exactly k-1, but in next steps, no? Because after the while loop ensures that window is at most k. So for example, when right is at position i, the window could have been larger, so we shrink it. But once it's processed, the next right will expand the window.\n\nWait no, because in each step, right increases by 1, so the following while loop reduces it back to size k. So for each right, the window after processing is exactly of size k (if possible) or maybe smaller than k, but only if the array is shorter than k.\n\nWait, for example, at right =k-1, window is exactly size k. Then for right=k, the window grows to k+1, so the while loop removes the left until window is k again, which is up to right=k and left=1.\n\nWait, but for right= k, the window would have to shrink to exactly k elements, moving left until right-left+1 is k.\n\nBut in the code, the while loop continues until the window is <=k. So perhaps for a given right, the window's size is right - left +1, but after shrinking, it becomes exactly, I think, up to k.\n\nSo in this approach, each time, after adding and adjusting, for the right step, we may have a window of size <=k, but in our case, we need to process each window exactly of size k.\n\nWait, but when the array is shorter than k, this is handled: for example, if the array is of length m <k, the function returns 0, due to the initial check.\n\nBut in the main code, suppose k is say 3, array has 5 elements. For right=0,1,2, window is less than 3; when right is 2, window size is 3, so max is updated. As right increases, window is adjusted to keep size k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make sure that after each step, when right >=k-1, the window is exactly k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the iteration, for each position where right >=k-1, we can process the window.\n\nWait, another approach: the windows are from 0 to k-1, 1 to k, 2 to k+1, etc., up to len(nums) -k.\n\nSo, another way is to loop for each possible window start (left from 0 to n -k), and for each window, calculate the number of distinct elements.\n\nBut for this, how do I calculate the distinct count each time efficiently?\n\nCalculating each window from scratch would be O(k) per window, leading to O(nk) time, which may not be efficient for large n and k.\n\nBut perhaps for this problem, given that the test cases are small, this approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, let's think about the first approach: use the sliding window with a while loop to keep the window size exactly k.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each right, the window after processing is either exactly k (if possible), or smaller, but when the array is smaller than k it's 0.\n\nIn the code, after adding the current element (nums[right]) and adjusting left, the window is not bigger than k.\n\nThen, we check if the window size is exactly k. If yes, compare current_distinct with max_distinct.\n\nBut in the early steps, when right is less than k-1, the window size is <k, and thus, not considered.\n\nSo this approach should capture all possible k-sized windows and compute their distinct counts.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first sample:\n\nSample: [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3], k=3.\n\nLet me walk through the code.\n\nInitialization: count_map is empty, left=0, max_distinct=0.\n\nright starts at 0:\n\nnum is 1: not in count_map, so count_map[1] =1, current_distinct=1.\n\nwindow size is 1-0+1=2>3? No.\n\nThen window size !=3, so max_distinct remains 0.\n\nright=1:\n\nnum=2: not in count_map, count=1, current_distinct=2.\n\nwindow size is 2, <=3.\n\nNo max update.\n\nright=2:\n\nnum=1: count_map[1] is 1, which was added before. So count_map[1] becomes 2. current_distinct remains 2.\n\nwindow size is 3. So current_distinct is 2 < max_distinct (0 becomes 2). So max becomes 2.\n\nBut the sample expects 3. Hmm. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the walk-through.\n\nWait, in the first window, when right=0, step by step:\n\nAfter right=0, left=0, window size 1. No.\n\nright=1:\n\nleft=0, window size 2.\n\nright=2:\n\nnum=1. So count_map had 1 before, so count is 2, current_distinct increases? Or no.\n\nWait no: when num is 1, and it was already in the count_map with a count of 1, which is non-zero. So current_distinct was 2 before. So adding 1 again, the current_distinct should remain 2, since 1 was already counted. So adding nums[right]=1: count_map[1] +=1 \u2192 2. current_distinct remains 2.\n\nThen, the window size is 3, so current_distinct is 2. So max_distinct becomes 2.\n\nThen right moves to 3:\n\nnum is 3. Not in count_map. So count_map[3] =1, current_distinct=3.\n\nwindow size = 3 +1 =4 >3 \u2192 enter while loop.\n\nIn while loop, remove nums[left]=nums[0]=1.\n\ncount_map[1] -=1 \u2192 1; since it's still >0, current_distinct remains 3.\n\nleft becomes 1.\n\nwindow size is now 3? Let's compute right=3 (nums[3] =3), left=1. 3 -1 +1 =3. So while loop stops.\n\nNow, check if window size is 3: yes. current_distinct is 3 \u2192 max becomes 3.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nRight=4:\n\nnum=4. Not in count_map. count becomes 1, current_distinct=4.\n\nwindow size increases to 4. So while loop runs.\n\nRemove nums[left=1]=2.\n\ncount_map[2] was 1 \u2192 0. So current_distinct -=1 \u21923.\n\nleft=2.\n\nwindow size is 3 (right=4, left=2: 4-2+1=3). Now, check - current_distinct is3, which is not higher than max (3). So no change.\n\nright=5: num=3.\n\nCheck count_map[3]: current value is 1? Because after adding at right=3, it was 1, and in right=4 step, no change to 3. So adding another 3 will not change current_distinct, but count_map[3] becomes 2.\n\nwindow size is 5-2+1=4>3. So enter while loop.\n\nRemove nums[2]=1. count_map[1] was 1 \u2192 0: current_distinct drops from 4 (wait, wait wait. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, at right=4, current_distinct was 3. After right=4 is processed, in the window, count_map includes nums[1,2,3,4], but after adjusting, it was 3,4, 3? Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nPerhaps it's better to take it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but my initial walk-through was inaccurate.\n\nBut back to the code: with the correct approach, in the first sample, it would have max_distinct=3, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct. Let's see.\n\nAnother test case: [1,1,2,2,3,3], k=3.\n\nExpected output is 2.\n\nProcessing this:\n\nEach window will have:\n\n[1,1,2] \u2192 distinct is 2.\n\n[1,2,2] \u2192 2.\n\n[2,2,3] \u2192 2.\n\n[2,3,3] \u2192 2.\n\nSo max is 2.\n\nLet's see the code:\n\nAt right=0: sets count_map[1] =1, current_distinct=1. window size 1, no change.\n\nAt right=1: count_map[1] becomes 2, current_distinct remains 1. window size 2, no.\n\nAt right=2: num=2. added to map, current_distinct 2. window size 3 ==k. So max becomes 2.\n\nAt right=3: num=2. count becomes 2. current_distinct remains 2. window size 4>3 \u2192 remove left=0 (num=1). count_map[1] is 2, subtract 1 \u21921. So current_distinct remains 2.\n\nleft is now 1. window size 3.\n\ncurrent_distinct is 2 \u2192 same as max, so no change.\n\nright=4: num=3. count_map adds to 1. current_distinct becomes 3.\n\nwindow size 3 (1- right=4, left=1 is 4-1+1=4>3. So enter while loop.\n\nremove left=1: num=1. count_map[1] was 1, becomes 0. current_distinct drops to 2. So (left=2, and loop ends as window size is 3.\n\nNow current_distinct is 2, same as max.\n\nright=5: num=3. count becomes 2. current_distinct remains 2.\n\nThus, the max remains 2.\n\nSo the code works for this scenario.\n\nAnother sample: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k=1 \u2192 max is 1.\n\nWhich the code should handle correctly.\n\nAnother sample: nums=[], k=3 \u2192 returns 0.\n\nAnother sample: nums = [1,2,1,3,4,3,5], k=3.\n\nWhich expects 3, but wait the function returns 3.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nSo, in code, the logic is to:\n\n- Handle edge cases where k is 0 or nums has length less than k, returns 0.\n\nElse, initialize variables:\n\ncount_map, left=0, max_distinct=0, current_distinct=0.\n\nThen, for each right in 0 to len(nums)-1:\n\nAdd the element to count_map: if it's new, current_distinct +=1.\n\nThen, while the window is larger than k, remove elements from the left until it's size k.\n\nThen, if window is size k, compare current_distinct and update max_distinct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when the window is processed, the window could be exactly k, and then current_distinct is checked, but for the sample where k=3 and the initial window is [1,2,1], the distinct count is 2, which is less than 3. But then, as we process more elements, it captures the window [1,3,4], where the count is 3.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, time to code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, when using a dictionary, the initial counts are handled correctly? Let's see.\n\nIn Python, if the key is not present, trying to access it gives a KeyError. So perhaps use collections.defaultdict(int) for count_map, which initializes missing keys with 0.\n\nWait no, because in the code, when we process nums[right], we check: if num in count_map:\n\nBut for defaultdict, it's easier because if the num is not present, it'll return 0.\n\nBut perhaps better to use defaultdict.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a normal dictionary is sufficient, using the get method.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can do:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef max_distinct_elements_in_subarray(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n\n    if k ==0 or len(nums) < k or k ==0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    count_map = defaultdict(int)\n\n    max_distinct = 0\n\n    current_distinct =0\n\n    left=0\n\n    for right in range(len(nums)):\n\n        num = nums[right]\n\n        if count_map[num] ==0:\n\n            current_distinct +=1\n\n        count_map[num] +=1\n\n        # Now check window size\n\n        while right - left +1 >k:\n\n            left_num = nums[left]\n\n            count_map[left_num] -=1\n\n            if count_map[left_num] ==0:\n\n                current_distinct -=1\n\n            left +=1\n\n        # After adjustment, check if window is k\n\n        if right - left +1 ==k:\n\n            if current_distinct > max_distinct:\n\n                max_distinct = current_distinct\n\n    return max_distinct\n\nWait, but this might have some issues. Let's test the case when multiple occurrences affect the count.\n\nWait, in the first sample with [1,2,1,3,4,3], when right=2, 1 is added, count_map[1] becomes 2. current_distinct is 2.\n\nBut then, when k=3 is not triggered until the window is larger than 3.\n\nWait, no. For right=0, left is 0, window is 1.\n\nright=1: left is 0, window is 2.\n\nright=2: window is 3, which is k. So current_distinct is 2, which is better than the initial max of 0.\n\nBut then, right=3: num=3 is added. Since count_map[3] was 0 before (because prior steps haven't added 3), current_distinct becomes 3.\n\nwindow size is 4, so it's now larger than k=3. So left increments by 1 (removes nums[0]=1, which in count_map had 2, now 1).\n\ncurrent_distinct remains 3.\n\nNow window size is 3 again. So check current_distinct (3) against max (2) \u2192 update max to 3.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when k=7 and the array has 7 elements, what's the distinct count? For example, the sample expects 5 when the array has 7 elements: [1,2,3,4,5,6], wait no. Wait, in the sample where k=7:\n\nSample input is [1,2,1,3,4,3,5], len=7, so the only window is the entire array. The distinct elements are 1,2,3,4,5 \u2192 total of 5 distinct. So the code should return 5.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIn the code, right will be 6.\n\nFor each right, processing until right=6: then, the window will consist of the entire array.\n\nTesting step:\n\nStarting from left=0.\n\nWhen right=6, the current_window will be 7 elements.\n\nAfter adding 5, count_map[5]=1, current_distinct becomes 5.\n\nThen, the while loop runs because 7>7? No, right- left +1 is 6 -0 +1 =7, which is equal to k=7. So no removal.\n\nThen, check if window size is 7 (k). So compare current_distinct (5) with max (probably 3 or lower). So max becomes 5.\n\nThus, code returns 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: [1,2,3,4,5,6], k=1 \u2192 should return1.\n\nBecause each subarray is of size 1, so only one element.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nFor each right:\n\nright=0: num=1. count_map[1]=1 \u2192 current_distinct=1.\n\nwindow size is 1 ==k \u2192 max becomes1.\n\nright=1: add 2. current_distinct=2. But window size becomes 2>1 \u2192 enter while loop, remove left=0.\n\ncount_map[1] becomes 0 \u2192 current_distinct drops to 1. left becomes1.\n\nwindow size=1 \u2192 current_distinct is1, same as max.\n\nThus, after all rights, the max remains 1.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother edge case: nums has elements with duplicates.\n\nWait, the code seems to correctly handle this.\n\nSo potential issues:\n\nWhat if the window is allowed to be up to k, but in some steps the code adds multiple elements leading to smaller max?\n\nWait, no, because the code only considers windows of size k, because after processing each right, if the window exceeds k, it's shrunk to exactly k, then the distinct count is checked only if the window size is exactly k.\n\nThus, code should correctly find the maximum among all k-sized windows.\n\nNow, let's think about the code:\n\nBut what if the array is of length n, and for some k, n-k is negative?\n\nBut earlier, code returns 0 if len(nums) <k. So that's handled.\n\nWait, let me check initial conditions:\n\nThe code says if k==0 or len(nums)<k or k ==0, return 0. Wait, but I see in the sample, for the last sample input, if k=0, returns 0.\n\nYep, in the code, the first condition is if k==0 or len(nums) <k: return 0.\n\nWait, but the same condition is written twice: \"k==0\" appears in both conditions. It can be handled as:\n\nif k ==0 or len(nums) <k:\n\nBut a better approach is to return 0 in such cases, regardless of anything else.\n\nNow, what about when the array is empty? The code handles it via len(nums) <k.\n\nThus, the code seems okay.\n\nWait, but when len(nums) is 0, len(nums) <k is True for any k>0.\n\nBut in the function signature, nums could be empty, and function returns 0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should look like the above.\n\nTesting it with the given samples:\n\nTesting sample 1: [1,2,1,3,4,3], function returns 3.\n\nSample 2: [1,2,1,3,4,3,5], k=3: function should return3. Let's see.\n\nThe maximum in any 3-length subarray:\n\nE.g., the window [1,3,4] gives distinct of 3.\n\nThus, code should find that.\n\nSample3: [1,2,1,3,4,3,5], k=4: expects4.\n\nThis would be the window [3,4,3,5] \u2192 the distinct are 3,4,5, which is 3, but wait no. Wait wait other windows:\n\nWait, let's think.\n\nList is [1,2,1,3,4,3,5].\n\nk=4.\n\nPossible windows:\n\n[1,2,1,3] \u2192distinct 3.\n\n[2,1,3,4]\u21924 distinct.\n\nYes, 2,1,3,4 are all distinct.\n\nThus the max is4.\n\nSo code should find that.\n\nLet's think how:\n\nAt right=3 (element3):\n\nwindow is 0 to3 \u2192 not, because variable expansion:\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nThe code's process for this case may capture the window [2,1,3,4] as follows:\n\nAt right=3 (index3, element3), after adding, the window could be extended beyond k=4.\n\nWait, perhaps during the steps when right=3 (element3):\n\nThe code processes adding element3.\n\ncount_map[3] is already in the count_map (adding, so current_distinct increases by1.\n\nThen the window size is 4 if right is 3 and window reaches that.\n\nBut perhaps in that case, the window hits 4 as the window size, and the current_distinct is checked.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code's process:\n\nFor right=3:\n\nelement=3.\n\ncount_map[3] is 1 \u2192 after adding, count_map[3] is 2.\n\nWait no, because in prior steps, like to the right is increasing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see the code walk-through.\n\nLet me walk through with nums=[1,2,1,3,4,3,5], k=4.\n\nn=7.\n\nProcessing steps:\n\nInitialize count_map, max_distinct=0, left=0.\n\nright=0, num=1:\n\ncount_map[1] becomes 1 \u2192 current_distinct=1.\n\nwindow size 1 <4 \u2192 no change to max.\n\nright=1, num=2: count=1 \u2192 current_distinct=2.\n\nwindow size 2.\n\nright=2, num=1: already in map. current_distinct remains 2.\n\nwindow size 3.\n\nright=3, num=3 \u2192 count_map[3] becomes 1: current_distinct=3.\n\nwindow size 4.\n\nsince right - left +1 ==4, check if current_distinct is 3 \u2192 which is higher than current max (0), so max becomes3.\n\nright=4, num=4: not in map \u2192 current_distinct=4.\n\nwindow size 5>4: so enter while loop.\n\nIn while loop, remove left=0 \u2192 num=1. count_map[1] 2 \u2192 1. current_distinct remains4 (since it was non-zero).\n\nleft becomes1.\n\nwindow size now 4 (4-1+1=4). So current_distinct is4. max becomes4.\n\nright=5, num=3: count was 1 \u2192 after adding 3, becomes2.\n\ncurrent_distinct remains4.\n\nwindow size5 \u21925>4. So remove left=1 (num=2). count_map[2] becomes0. Thus, current_distinct=3.\n\nleft becomes2.\n\nwindow size right=5, left=2 \u21925-2+1=4. So check if current_distinct=3 <4 \u2192 no.\n\nright=6, num=5: added, current_distinct=4.\n\nwindow size4. So compare with max, which is4. No change.\n\nThus, the code returns4, which is correct.\n\nThus, sample3 is handled correctly.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo the final code is as described.\n\nBut wait, the initial code I wrote has a check if the window is of size k after processing, but does that mean it will only check for k-sized windows starting from the beginning of the array.\n\nWait no. Because when the array is processed, for each possible window of size k, the code will capture it as right >=left and the window is exactly size k.\n\nBecause as you process each right, once the window is exactly k, it's considered.\n\nSo yes, the code should capture all possible k-sized windows.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of distinct elements in any continuous subarray of a given size \\( k \\) from an unsorted array of integers. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: If \\( k \\) is 0, or the array is empty, or its length is less than \\( k \\), return 0 immediately as there can be no valid subarray.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of size \\( k \\) and track the number of distinct elements within this window.\n3. **Hash Map for Counting**: Utilize a hash map (dictionary) to count occurrences of each element within the current window. This helps efficiently manage and update the count of elements as the window slides through the array.\n4. **Adjust Window Size**: For each new element added to the window, ensure the window size does not exceed \\( k \\) by adjusting the left boundary of the window. If the window exceeds size \\( k \\), move the left boundary to the right until the window size is exactly \\( k \\).\n5. **Track Maximum Distinct Elements**: Keep track of the maximum number of distinct elements found in any valid window of size \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef max_distinct_elements_in_subarray(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n    if k == 0 or len(nums) < k:\n        return 0\n    \n    count_map = defaultdict(int)\n    max_distinct = 0\n    current_distinct = 0\n    left = 0\n    \n    for right in range(len(nums)):\n        num = nums[right]\n        if count_map[num] == 0:\n            current_distinct += 1\n        count_map[num] += 1\n        \n        # Ensure the window size does not exceed k\n        while right - left + 1 > k:\n            left_num = nums[left]\n            count_map[left_num] -= 1\n            if count_map[left_num] == 0:\n                current_distinct -= 1\n            left += 1\n        \n        # Update max_distinct if the current window is exactly size k\n        if right - left + 1 == k:\n            if current_distinct > max_distinct:\n                max_distinct = current_distinct\n    \n    return max_distinct\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function immediately returns 0 if \\( k \\) is 0 or the array length is less than \\( k \\).\n2. **Sliding Window Initialization**: A dictionary `count_map` is used to keep track of the count of each element in the current window. `left` is the starting index of the current window, and `max_distinct` keeps track of the maximum number of distinct elements found.\n3. **Expand Window**: For each new element added (at index `right`), update the count in `count_map`. If the element is new to the current window, increment the count of distinct elements.\n4. **Adjust Window Size**: If the window size exceeds \\( k \\), move the left boundary to the right, updating the counts and distinct elements as necessary.\n5. **Update Maximum Distinct**: After adjusting the window, if the window size is exactly \\( k \\), update `max_distinct` if the current number of distinct elements is greater than the previous maximum.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed efficiently, maintaining the window size and updating counts in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of \\( O(n) \\).",
