  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the maximum profit possible from trading a stock with a transaction fee. The function is called maxProfitWithTransactionFee and it takes in a list of prices and a fee. The goal is to find the maximum profit achievable considering the fee for each transaction.\n\nSo, first, I should understand the problem thoroughly. The problem allows multiple buy-sell transactions. Each time I buy and then sell, I have to pay a transaction fee. Also, I can't have overlapping transactions, meaning I have to sell before buying again.\n\nHmm, so the approach likely involves some sort of dynamic programming because we need to track the state over each day.\n\nLet me think about what's similar to this problem. There's the classic \"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II\" problem where you can buy and sell multiple times. The solution for that involves buying whenever the price increases, effectively accumulating all the small profits. But here, each transaction incurs a fee, so we can't just do that\u2014 we need to make sure each transaction's profit outweighs the fee.\n\nSo, perhaps I need a dynamic programming approach where I track two states: holding the stock, and not holding it. But for each day, the decision to buy or sell depends on whether the profit after the fee is worth it.\n\nLet me think about the states. Let's denote:\n\n- dp_hold[i]: the maximum profit by the i-th day when holding the stock.\n- dp_not_hold[i]: the maximum profit by the i-th day when not holding the stock.\n\nBut another way to model it is to track two variables moving forward: one represents the best profit when you are holding the stock, and the other when you are not. Because for each day, the decision is whether to buy or sell.\n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. Let's think in terms of variables rather than arrays. Because for large N (up to 5e4), using O(1) variables is better for space.\n\nSo, I can have variables:\n\n- hold: represents the maximum profit if I am holding the stock on the current day.\n- not_hold: represents the maximum profit if I am not holding the stock on the current day.\n\nHow do these variables get updated each day?\n\nLet's think about transitions.\n\nFor each day, after processing the price, I update hold and not_hold as follows.\n\nThe previous day's hold can't change, but from the previous day's not_hold, we can decide to buy today. Also, maybe we can sell from hold to get a new not_hold state.\n\nWait, let's think clearly:\n\nOn day i, the price is prices[i].\n\nThe next day is i+1, but processing each price in order, so perhaps for each day, I look at the current price and update the variables.\n\nSo, for each step:\n\n1. The decision to buy: if I'm not holding the stock, I can choose to buy it today. The cost would be the price minus whatever I have. Wait, no. Wait, actually, when I'm not holding, buying the stock would change my profit.\n\nWait, it's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nAt any given day, the hold state is the maximum profit achievable up to that day, ending with holding the stock.\n\nSimilarly, not_hold is ending with not holding.\n\nSo, on day i:\n\nhold[i] = max( hold[i-1], (not_hold[i-1] - price[i]) )\nWait no, because not_hold[i-1] is the profit if I'm not holding. To buy on day i, I spend prices[i], so hold[i] would be not_hold[i-1] - prices[i].\n\nBut wait, in some versions of this problem, the hold is maximum between keeping the previous hold (doing nothing) or buying today (subtract today's price from whatever you have when you are not holding).\n\nYes, right. So hold[i] = max( hold[i-1], not_hold[i-1] - price[i] )\n\nBut then, what about selling? To transition into not_hold[i], you can either do nothing (carry over not_hold[i-1]) or sell the stock.\n\nWait, no: not_hold[i] is the max between not doing anything (keep not_hold[i-1]) or selling the stock, which would be hold[i-1] + price[i]. Because if you were holding, you can sell and gain that price.\n\nSo:\n\nnot_hold[i] = max( not_hold[i-1], hold[i-1] + price[i] )\n\nBut wait, also, I have to account for the transaction fee. Oh right, each transaction (buy or sell?) Wait, each buy-sell pair is a transaction, so the fee is per transaction. So each time I sell, I have to deduct the fee. Or maybe, each transaction is either a buy or a sell, but wait no: a transaction is buying and selling one share, so for each buy and sell pair, one fee is paid.\n\nWait, from the problem statement: a transaction is buying and then selling. So each transaction (each buy and sell) costs the fee. So every time I sell, that's part of a transaction. So each time I decide to sell and then buy again, I have to pay the fee again.\n\nWait, but how to model it correctly. Because for each transaction, you buy and sell, which costs the fee once. So each time I do a sell (which implies a previous buy), the transaction fee is subtracted from the profit.\n\nSo, perhaps in the transition, when selling, the fee is applied.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the steps.\n\nWhen you sell the stock on day i:\n\nIf you sell, you add the price to your profit and subtract the fee for the transaction. So when transitioning from hold to not_hold, the profit is holds_value + current price, minus the fee.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the transaction fee is per transaction. Each transaction is a buy followed by a sell. So for each buy without selling, you don't pay the fee. Oh wait no: you have to both buy and sell to make a transaction. So each time you buy, to complete the transaction, you have to sell it, paying the fee once.\n\nSo, the fee is applied every time you complete a transaction, which is a buy followed by a sell.\n\nBut how does that affect the transitions.\n\nSo for the hold state: when we decide to buy, the cost is price. Then, when we decide to sell, we gain the selling price but lose the fee.\n\nWait, perhaps hold represents the profit if we end the day having bought the stock (which could be after a buy or just continuing to hold it). not_hold represents the profit if we end the day after possibly selling.\n\nSo, each time we choose to sell from hold, we have to account for the fee.\n\nSo when updating not_hold, if we decide to sell, the profit would be hold[i-1] + price[i] - fee.\n\nBut wait, let's formalize this.\n\nOn day i, when considering whether to sell, the profit would be increased by selling the stock at price[i]. However, this incurs a transaction fee. So, when selling, the profit is added by the price and subtracted by the fee.\n\nSo, hold[i-1] is the maximum profit possible if on day i-1, I held the stock. So on day i, I can sell it for price[i], so the total would be hold[i-1] + price[i], then subtract fee to account for the transaction (buying and selling).\n\nAlternatively, another way: each transaction after selling would subtract the fee once. So every time I sell (transition from hold to not_hold), I have to subtract the fee.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the transition equations:\n\nhold[i] = max(hold[i-1], not_hold[i-1] - price[i])\n\nBecause if I don't do anything, hold remains the same as before. Or if I buy on day i, I take the previous not_hold profit, subtract the current price to get the new hold value.\n\nFor not_hold[i]: it can be either keeping the previous not_hold (do nothing) OR selling the stock on day i, which adds the current price but subtracts the fee. So:\n\nnot_hold[i] = max(not_hold[i-1], hold[i-1] + price[i] - fee)\n\nYes, that's correct. Because you're selling the stock, which brings in price[i], but you have to pay the fee every time you complete a transaction (i.e., a sell action).\n\nBut wait, would selling multiple times accumulate multiple fees? Because each sell is part of a transaction.\n\nYes. So each time you sell, you incur the fee once. So, the transition holds.\n\nBut wait, what about when you have multiple small increases, but each time you sell, you pay a fee. For example, buying on day 1, selling on day 2 (fee 1), then buying again on day 2, selling on day 3 (fee 2), etc. Each transaction is a separate case.\n\nSo the way the transition is designed, each sale subtracts the fee.\n\nSo, the state transitions account for this correctly.\n\nNow, the initial state.\n\nOn day 0:\n\nhold is -prices[0], because you bought the stock on day 0, so the profit is negative (initially you spent money to buy). Or perhaps initially, hold is -prices[0] minus the fee? Wait, no. Because the fee is paid when you SELL. So buying doesn't subtract the fee.\n\nWait, no. The fee per transaction is for buying and selling. So you pay the fee only when you SELL.\n\nSo, when you sell, your profit decreases by fee.\n\nSo, initial state.\n\nIf you start with holding the stock on day 0, your profit is -prices[0], because you paid the money to buy.\n\nIf you start with not holding, your profit is 0.\n\nSo, for day 0:\n\nhold = -prices[0]\n\nnot_hold = 0.\n\nSo, for each day, we can loop through the prices, starting from day 1, and compute the current hold and not_hold based on the previous values.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize hold and not_hold.\n\nThen, for each price in prices (starting from the first, probably), update hold and not_hold according to the transitions.\n\nWait, but since the 'prices' list is given as a list, perhaps for each i in range(1, len(prices)), we process price i.\n\nLet me try to write the transitions step by step.\n\nLet's think with an example.\n\nSuppose prices are [1,3,2,8,5,9], fee is 2.\n\nWe need to track hold and not_hold.\n\nInitially, hold = -1, not_hold=0.\n\nDay 1 (price=3):\n\nhold is max(-1, 0-3) = max(-1, -3) \u2192 -1 remains.\n\nnot_hold is max(0, (-1) +3 -2)= max(0, 0)= 0.\n\nBut wait, selling on day 1 would give profit (-1)+3-2=0, which is same as previous not_hold.\n\nSo, hold is -1, not_hold is 0.\n\nBut it's better not to sell here? Or is it, but in this case, the fee is 2, and the profit from selling is 3-2=1, which is better than not selling, but the calculations seem correct.\n\nWait, perhaps this example isn't the best, but the logic needs to hold.\n\nSo proceeding, for each day, the transitions are as I described.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle this for each price.\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_hold = -prices[0]\n\nprev_not_hold = 0\n\nThen for i from 1 to len(prices)-1:\n\ncurrent_hold = max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold - prices[i])\n\ncurrent_not_hold = max(prev_not_hold, prev_hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nSet prev_hold and prev_not_hold to current_*, then proceed.\n\nBut for the initial setup.\n\nBut how about when the prices list is empty? But the constraints say prices.length is at least 1.\n\nSo, after processing all days, the maximum profit is the max of prev_hold and prev_not_hold.\n\nWait, because in the end, you can choose to hold the stock, but that gives a profit of -price[i], which is a loss if you don't sell.\n\nSo better to take the maximum between hold and not_hold, but probably not_hold is higher.\n\nWait, no: in the setup, holding the stock might be better if it's expected that the next day's price is higher. But since in the final day, you don't have a next day, for the problem statement, you can't hold any longer, so the maximum profit must be not_hold.\n\nWait, the function is to compute the maximum profit possible after any number of transactions, considering that you can choose to end at any time. So, the maximum profit is the higher of hold and not_hold after processing all days.\n\nBut wait, if you hold the stock on the last day, you could have a higher potential, but it's not accounted for since you have to sell before the end of that day. So in the end, you can't hold anymore, so the hold is not a valid state, because you can't make more transactions beyond the end of the list.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit will be in the not_hold state.\n\nWait, but in our initial state, for the first day, it's possible to hold. But on the last day, if you choose to hold, but can't do anything.\n\nSo for the final result, we should choose the max between the two.\n\nBecause, perhaps on the last day, the hold is higher than not_hold.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, for the final step, after processing all days, the variables hold and not_hold are: hold is the state where you have the stock, not_hold is where you have sold it. The function wants to compute the maximum possible profit, which could be in either state.\n\nBut logically, after the last day, you won't be able to sell, so if you have the stock, it's just as if you never sold it. So the profit is whatever you had when you bought it, but that would require that you consider whether it's better to have sold earlier or not.\n\nBut in the moving variables approach, when processing the last day, if selling gives you a higher profit, not_hold will have the higher value.\n\nBut if, for example, the last transaction was not completed because it would have made you go into a loss, perhaps you should choose not to sell on that day.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to take the maximum between hold and not_hold in the end.\n\nWait, let's see with a small test case.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nprices = [1,4], fee = 1.\n\nInitially:\n\nhold = -1, not_hold = 0.\n\nNext day (price=4):\n\ncurrent_hold = max(-1, 0 -4)= max(-1, -4) = -1.\n\ncurrent_not_hold = max(0, (-1)+4-1)= max(0, 2) =2.\n\nSo after processing both days, the maximum is 2.\n\nWhich is correct: buy on day 0, sell on day 1. Profit is 4-1-1 = 4- (price + fee) = 3, wait.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that each transaction has a fee. So the first transaction is buy on 1, sell on 4: profit is (4-1 - fee) = 2.\n\nWhich matches current_not_hold as 2.\n\nSo the code would return 2.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nprices = [4,1], fee =1.\n\nSo first, initial hold =-4, not_hold=0.\n\nDay 2: price=1.\n\ncurrent_hold = max(-4, 0-1 =-1). So current_hold is -4.\n\ncurrent_not_hold = max(0, (-4 +1) -1 = -4). So current_not_hold remains 0.\n\nSo the maximum is 0.\n\nWhich makes sense: you can choose not to perform any transactions, or buy on day 1 and sell on day 2 for a loss, so notHold remains higher as 0.\n\nSo, taking the maximum between hold and not_hold is correct.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the maximum would have been not_hold=0.\n\nSo, hence, the final result is the maximum between hold and not_hold.\n\nWait, but what if there's a scenario where in the last day, you have a high hold value because the price is highest on the last day, and you should hold it but not sell. Although that's impossible because the last day is the end.\n\nTherefore, the maximum is correct when taken as max(hold, not_hold).\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nAfter processing all prices, return max(hold, not_hold).\n\nBut in some cases, the hold can be higher. For example, what if the last day's price is higher than any previous, but not enough to justify selling (due to the fee), but you buy on the last day expecting more profit.\n\nNo, because once you reach the last day, you can't sell anymore. So that scenario is impossible.\n\nWait, no. For example:\n\nprices = [5,6]. fee=5.\n\nInitial hold is -5, not_hold is 0.\n\nDay 2, price=6.\n\ncurrent_hold = max(-5, 0-6=-6) \u2192 -5.\n\ncurrent_not_hold = max(0, (-5+6) -5= -4). So max(0,-4) is 0.\n\nHence, the maximum is 0.\n\nWhich is correct: you can't sell on day 2 and then gain 6, but since the fee is 5, 6-5 =1, so profit is 1. But according to the transitions, hold is -5 at day 1. So selling on day2 gives (-5 +6 ) =1, minus fee (5) \u2192-4, which is worse than notHold previous value (0).\n\nOops, that's a problem.\n\nWait, what's the actual calculation?\n\nBecause the fee is 5.\n\nSo, the transaction would be: buy at 5, sell at 6, with a profit of (6-5) =1, but fee is 5, so profit is -4.\n\nSo the profit is negative, so you wouldn't perform that transaction.\n\nHence, better to not do any transaction: profit is 0.\n\nWhich is what the code correctly returns.\n\nSo, the code works correctly here.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where the hold could be higher than not_hold even after the last day? Let's think.\n\nSuppose prices are [10, 100], fee=90.\n\nHold on day 0: -10.\n\nHold on day 1: max(-10, (0 - 100)= -100) \u2192-10.\n\nNot_hold on day1: max(0, (-10 + 100) - 90 = (90-90)=0. So not_hold remains 0.\n\nSo, max is 0.\n\nWhich is correct: Profit is 100-10-90=0.\n\nBut what if the fee is 80.\n\nHold on day1 is -10.\n\nNot_hold on day1: (90 -80) =10.\n\nSo, notHold is 10.\n\nSo, max is 10.\n\nWhich is correct: buy at 10, sell at 100, fee is 80 \u2192 90-80=10.\n\nSo the code correctly captures this.\n\nNow, another test case where the hold is higher than not_hold on the last day.\n\nWait, is that possible? Because the last day, you can only decide to sell or not, but if selling brings a worse profit than hold, then you have to not sell, but that's not allowed because you have to stop trading.\n\nWait, but in the DP transitions, the final hold is either continuing to hold or buying on last day.\n\nWait, maybe the last day's hold can be a better value than notHold.\n\nWait, let's take:\n\nPrices = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 2], fee is 1.\n\nLet me compute step by step.\n\nDay 0:\n\nhold = -1, not_hold=0.\n\nDay 1, price=2:\n\ncurrent_hold = max( -1, 0-2=-2 \u2192 -1)\n\ncurrent_notHold = max(0, (-1+2)-1=0 \u21920.\n\nSo, hold remains -1, notHold is 0.\n\nDay2, price=4.\n\ncurrent_hold = max( -1, 0-4=-4 \u2192-1)\n\ncurrent_notHold = max(0, (-1 +4)-1=2 \u21922.\n\nSo, now notHold is 2.\n\nDay3, price=3.\n\ncurrent_hold = max(-1, 2-3= -1 \u2192 moving variables.\n\nWait, current_hold is max( previous hold (-1) , notHold_prev (2) - price (3) ) \u2192 max(-1, -1)= -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max( 2, (-1) +3 -1=1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo, notHold remains 2.\n\nDay4, price=5:\n\ncurrent_hold = max( -1, 2-5= -3 \u2192 -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max( 2, (-1 +5) -1=3 \u21923.\n\nSo notHold becomes 3.\n\nDay5, price=2:\n\ncurrent_hold: max(-1, 3 -2=1\u2192 current_hold is 1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max(3, ( (-1) +2 ) -1=0 \u21923.\n\nSo after processing all days, hold is 1, notHold is 3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct: The best is to buy on 2, sell on 4, and then not do anything else.\n\nWait, no: let's see the transactions:\n\nWe could buy on day 1 (price 2) and sell on day 2 (price4), profit is (4-2) =2, minus fee 1 \u21921 per transaction. Then buy on day3 (price3), sell on day4 (price5): (5-3)=2, minus fee 1 \u21921. So two transactions, total profit 2.\n\nBut according to our code, the notHold is 3. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, because actually the code is accounting for something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, because perhaps the transaction that ends on day4.\n\nHow do the transitions compute notHold as 3.\n\nWait, let me go step by step:\n\nprev_hold = -1, prev_notHold=2 at day2.\n\nAt day3, price3.\n\ncurrentHold = max( -1, 2-3=-1 \u2192-1.\n\ncurrentNotHold = max(2, (-1 +3) -1=1 \u21922.\n\nSo, prev_hold =-1, prev_notHold=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the code correctly captures all possible transactions.\n\nWait, maybe the DP approach tracks all possible options and finds the best, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: what is the best way.\n\nIn the example where on day5, the code's hold is 1.\n\nBut notHold is 3.\n\nSo, the maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is achieved by transactions that sell on day4, thus the notHold is 3.\n\nIf on day5, selling is not profitable because the price is 2: adding 2 to hold (-1 +2 =1, minus fee is 0 \u2192 which is worse than notHold of 3.\n\nSo, it's better to have sold on day4.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nSo, in the last case, the maximum is 3, which is in notHold.\n\nOnly in cases where the hold is higher than notHold in the last day would the maximum be hold: but that would only happen if, for example, the price is initially 1, and for the last day the price is 100, and the fee is 10.\n\nBut no, because even then, selling on the last day would yield a higher notHold.\n\nFor example,\n\nprices = [1, 100], fee=10.\n\nday0: hold=-1.\n\nday1: sell, notHold = (-1 +100) -10=89.\n\nThus, the maximum is 89.\n\nYes.\n\nUnless, moving variables due to some step, but I'm not thinking of a case where hold is higher on the last day than notHold.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that for the code to capture the correct state, the final step is to return the maximum of hold and notHold.\n\nHence, the algorithm is as follows:\n\n- Initialize prev_hold as -prices[0], prev_not_hold as 0.\n\n- For each price in prices[1:]:\n\n   current_hold = max( prev_hold, prev_not_hold - price )\n\n   current_not_hold = max( prev_not_hold, prev_hold + price - fee )\n\n   Update prev_hold and prev_not_hold to current_hold and current_not_hold.\n\n- After processing all prices, return max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold).\n\nWait, that's the plan.\n\nBut let me code this and see.\n\nSo, in Python, the function will be:\n\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if not prices:\n        return 0\n    prev_hold = -prices[0]\n    prev_not_hold = 0\n    for price in prices[1:]:\n        current_hold = max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold - price)\n        current_not_hold = max(prev_not_hold, prev_hold + price - fee)\n        prev_hold, prev_not_hold = current_hold, current_not_hold\n    return max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold)\n\nWait, but I think that this logic might not handle cases correctly where the transaction fees accumulate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the same as the problem's transaction fee being subtracted every time a sell occurs.\n\nYes, because each time the code decides to sell (which is the case when current_not_hold changes due to the second option), the fee is subtracted once.\n\nThen, this approach will correctly model multiple transactions.\n\nLet me test a few examples.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nprices = [2, 1], fee =0.\n\nprev_hold = -2, prev_not_hold=0.\n\nprice=1:\n\ncurrent_hold = max(-2, 0-1=-1 ) \u2192-1.\n\ncurrent_not_hold = max(0, -2+1 -0= -1 \u21920.\n\nSo, maximum is 0.\n\nWhich is correct: you can't sell, so you don't do any transaction.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nprices = [1,3,2,8], fee =2.\n\nWe should do:\n\nBuy 1, sell 3 \u2192 profit 0 (3-1-2=0).\n\nThen buy 2, sell 8 \u2192 (8-2 -2) =4.\n\nTotal profit 0 +4=4.\n\nNotHold in the last step should be 4.\n\nLet's track:\n\nInitially, hold=-1, notHold=0.\n\nDay 1, price=3:\n\ncurrent_hold = max( -1, 0-3=-3 \u2192 -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold= max(0, (-1+3 -2)=0 \u21920.\n\nSo, prev is now: hold=-1, notHold=0.\n\nDay2, price=2:\n\ncurrent_hold= max( -1, 0-2=-2 \u2192 remains -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold= max(0, (-1 +2 -2 )= -1 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nDay3, price=8:\n\ncurrent_hold= max( -1, 0-8=-8 \u2192 -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold= max(0, (-1 +8-2 )=5 \u21925.\n\nSo, final max is max(-1,5) =5, which is higher than 4. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, what's the logic here.\n\nWait, the fee is 2 per sell.\n\nAlternative approach, the optimal.\n\nBuy on day 1 (price1=1), sell on day3 (price=8): profit is 8-1=7, but you pay the fee once:7-2=5.\n\nThe alternative is to buy on day1, sell on day2, and buy on day3, sell on day4.\n\nNo, but with days being [1,3,2,8], the transitions are:\n\nHold = -1, notHold=0.\n\nDay1, price3:\n\ncurrent_hold: max(-1, 0-3=-3 \u2192-1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max(0, -1 +3 -2=0 \u21920.\n\nSo, notHold remains 0.\n\nAlternatively, sell here gives 3-1 -2=0.\n\nBut it's same as notHold.\n\nSo, now, on day2 (price2), which is 2.\n\ncurrent_hold: max( current_hold (-1), notHold (0) -2 =-2 \u2192max is -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max(0, -1 + 2-2= -1 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nOn day3, price8.\n\ncurrent_hold: max( -1, 0-8= -8 \u2192 remains -1.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max( 0, ( -1+8)-2=5.\n\nSo, notHold is 5. Which is the profit if you buy on day0, sell on day3, which is 3.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures this.\n\nThus, in that case, the function would return 5, which is correct.\n\nThis makes me think that the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nprices = [1,3,2,8,5,9], fee =2.\n\nThis is a case where multiple transactions can be made.\n\nBut let's track:\n\nInitially hold=-1, notHold=0.\n\nDay1: price=3:\n\nhold remains -1.\n\nnotHold: max(0, (-1+3) -2=0\u21920.\n\nDay2: price2.\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-2=-2 \u2192-1.\n\nnotHold: max(0, (-1 +2)-2= -1 \u21920.\n\nDay3: price8.\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-8=-8 \u2192-1.\n\nnotHold: max(0, (-1+8)-2=5.\n\nSo, now notHold is5.\n\nDay4: price5.\n\ncurrent_hold: max(-1,5-5=0 \u2192 max(-1,0)=0.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max(5, (-1 +5)-2=2. \u2192 max(5,2) is5.\n\nSo, hold is 0, notHold remains5.\n\nDay5: price9.\n\ncurrent_hold = max(0,5-9= -4 \u21920.\n\ncurrent_notHold = max(5, 0+9-2=7.\n\nSo, notHold is7.\n\nFinal max(0,7) is7.\n\nThis is correct:\n\nThe transactions would be:\n\nBuy day0 (1), sell day3 (8) \u2192 profit 8-1-2=5.\n\nThen, hold at day4 is 0 (we have 5 from previous notHold, and we buy on day4 at 5, so hold becomes 5-5=0.\n\nThen, on day5, sell at 9, adding 9-0-2=7? Or wait, notHold is 5 + (9 -5)-2?\n\nWait, perhaps the code correctly captures all the possible transactions and fees.\n\nBut in this case, the code finds a profit of7, which is correct.\n\nSo, in that case, the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about the case where it's better to do two transactions despite the fees.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nprices = [2,5,1,3], fee=2.\n\nLet's compute manually.\n\nThe optimal strategy:\n\nBuy on day0 (2), sell on day1 (5): profit is5-2=3. Then subtract fee \u21921.\n\nThen, buy on day2 (1), sell on day3 (3): profit is 3-1=2, subtract fee \u21921.\n\nTotal profit: 1+1=2.\n\nBut let's see what the code computes.\n\nDay0:\n\nhold=-2, notHold=0.\n\nDay1, price5:\n\ncurrent_hold= max(-2, 0-5= -5 \u2192-2.\n\ncurrent_notHold= max(0, (-2+5)-2= 1.\n\nSo, notHold becomes1.\n\nDay2, price1:\n\ncurrent_hold= max(-2, 1-1=0 \u21920.\n\ncurrent_notHold= max(1, (-2 +1) -2= -3 \u21921.\n\nDay3, price3:\n\ncurrent_hold: max(0, 1-3= -2 \u21920.\n\ncurrent_notHold: max(1, 0+3 -2=1 \u2192max(1,1)=1.\n\nSo, final max is max(0,1)=1.\n\nHmm, but this is correct? Because the actual profit after two transactions is 2, but according to the code, it's 1.\n\nWhat is happening.\n\nWait no: each transaction has its own fee.\n\nIn this case, the two transactions give a profit of (5-2-2) + (3-1-2) =1+0=1.\n\nSo, the code's result is 1, which is correct.\n\nHence, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle cases where multiple transactions are beneficial.\n\nSo, this logic works.\n\nSo, the final code is as I wrote.\n\nI'll proceed to code this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum profit achievable from trading a stock given an array of daily prices and a transaction fee. The challenge is to account for the transaction fee for each buy-sell transaction, where each transaction consists of buying and then selling one share of the stock.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using dynamic programming to track two states:\n1. `hold`: The maximum profit achievable up to the current day if we are holding the stock.\n2. `not_hold`: The maximum profit achievable up to the current day if we are not holding the stock.\n\nThe key transitions are as follows:\n- `hold`: Can either continue holding the stock from the previous day or buy the stock on the current day.\n- `not_hold`: Can either continue not holding the stock from the previous day or sell the stock on the current day, paying the transaction fee.\n\nBy iterating through each day's price, we update these states to reflect the maximum profit achievable by either continuing the previous state or making a transaction.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if not prices:\n        return 0\n    prev_hold = -prices[0]\n    prev_not_hold = 0\n    for price in prices[1:]:\n        current_hold = max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold - price)\n        current_not_hold = max(prev_not_hold, prev_hold + price - fee)\n        prev_hold, prev_not_hold = current_hold, current_not_hold\n    return max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `prev_hold` to `-prices[0]` because if we buy the stock on the first day, we start with a negative profit (the cost of the stock). `prev_not_hold` is initialized to 0 because we start with no profit if we don't buy the stock.\n\n2. **Iteration Through Prices**: For each subsequent day's price, we update the states:\n   - `current_hold` is the maximum of holding the stock from the previous day or buying it on the current day.\n   - `current_not_hold` is the maximum of not holding the stock from the previous day or selling the stock on the current day, which includes subtracting the transaction fee.\n\n3. **Result**: After processing all the prices, the result is the maximum value between `prev_hold` and `prev_not_hold`, representing the maximum profit achievable.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the optimal decisions for buying and selling the stock while accounting for the transaction fee, ensuring we maximize the profit.",
