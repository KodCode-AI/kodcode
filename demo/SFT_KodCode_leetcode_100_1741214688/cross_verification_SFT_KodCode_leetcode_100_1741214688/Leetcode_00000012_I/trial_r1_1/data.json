You can complete as many buy-sell transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. A transaction consists of buying and then selling one share of the stock. You cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\n### Function Signature\n```python\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    pass\n```\n\n### Constraints\n- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`\n- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`\n- `0 <= fee < 10^5`",

  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to design a function called maxProfitWithTransactionFee. The function takes an array of daily prices and a transaction fee, and returns the maximum profit possible. Hmm, what's allowed here? Oh right, you can buy and sell multiple times, but each transaction, which is buying and then selling, incurs the fee. So each time I buy and then sell, I pay the fee. Also, I can't do multiple transactions at once, so I have to sell before I can buy again.\n\nThinking about how to model this. I remember some problems where dynamic programming is used for stock trading. Maybe this is a variation of the best time to buy and sell stock problem.\n\nIn the problem without a transaction fee and with unlimited transactions, we could just accumulate all the positive differences between consecutive days. But here, each buy-sell (one round trip) deducts a fee, so I think I need to consider when it's worth to make a trade even after paying the fee.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe, for each day, I need to track the maximum profit if I end up holding the stock or not holding it.\n\nSo perhaps have two variables:\n- buy: the maximum profit when on that day, we have bought the stock.\n- sell: the maximum profit when on that day, we have sold the stock or are not holding it.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think in terms of what's the maximum profit just after the current day, either having the stock or not.\n\nIn classic DP for the problem with fees, I think the state can be split into:\nhold[i]: the maximum profit up to day i when you are holding the stock.\nunhold[i]: the maximum profit when you are not holding the stock.\n\nSo for each day, for hold[i], you can either buy the stock on day i (so subtract the price i) if you were not holding it before and pay the fee? Or wait, no, transactions involve buying and then selling. So each buy is followed by a sell.\n\nWait, no. For each transaction, you buy and then sell. So each time you buy, you add the transaction to your list. But for the DP perhaps it's better to model each state, whether you are holding the stock or not, each day.\n\nLet's think recursively.\n\nFor each day i:\n\nIf I hold the stock on day i, then either I held it on day i-1 and do nothing, or I bought it on day i from the state of not holding it on day i-1, and paid the transaction fee? Wait, no\u2014wait, when do you pay the fee? For each buy-sell transaction, so each sell after a buy.\n\nSo perhaps when you sell on a day, you pay the fee. Or, each time you complete a buy-sell, which is a transaction, you pay the fee.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to model each sell as a transaction. So every time you sell, a fee is subtracted.\n\nWait, wait. In this problem, each time you buy and then sell, it's a transaction, and each such transaction incurs a fee. So for each sale, you have to pay a fee.\n\nSo, when I decide to sell on day i, if I have bought it on some day j < i, then I pay the fee once. The profit for that transaction is (sell_price - buy_price - fee).\n\nBut that's when you do a transaction. So for multiple transactions, each of them will subtract a fee.\n\nSo maybe the DP approach needs to model the maximum profit if I'm holding the stock on day i, and the maximum profit if I'm not holding it.\n\nSo let's set up:\n\nhold[i] = maximum profit on day i when I hold the stock.\n\nunhold[i] = maximum profit on day i when I don't hold the stock.\n\nThe transition would be:\n\nFor hold[i], it's either I have held the stock on day i-1, or I just bought it on day i.\n\nBut what's the cost of buying? Since buying is part of a transaction, but the fee is charged when selling, so I'm not sure. Or maybe the fee is charged per transaction, which is per sell. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP transitions can be as follows.\n\nunhold[i] = max( unhold[i-1], sell_price - fee + hold[i-1] )\n\nWait, wait, no. Because when you sell, you have to pay the fee. So when you decide to sell on day i, the profit is hold[i-1] because that's the profit you had from buying before, sell on day i, so the profit is prices[i] - (prices[j] - all previous transactions) minus the fee.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to represent the current maximum profit when holding or not holding.\n\nLet me think of it this way: for each day, the maximum profit if you are holding the stock is max( previous hold, (previous unhold - current price) perhaps? But considering the fee. Or maybe not. Maybe when you buy, you are considering that you will do a sell in the future.\n\nWait, perhaps the standard approach for this problem is to track two states: whether you have the stock (in which case, any previous profit is considered and the cost is, or whether you don't have it, meaning you might have just sold it, paying the fee).\n\nLet's look for similar problems. Oh right, I remember that when there is a transaction fee, the DP state transitions are modified to account for the fee when a transaction is made.\n\nFrom a solution I remember, the state transitions are:\n\nhold[i] = max(hold[i-1], unhold[i-1] - price[i])\n\nunhold[i] = max(unhold[i-1], hold[i-1] + price[i] - fee )\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, that might not account correctly for multiple transactions. Or perhaps it does. Let me think.\n\nFor hold[i], it's the maximum profit you can have if you hold the stock on day i.\n\nThat could be either:\n\n1. You held it on day i-1, so you do nothing\u2014hold[i-1].\n\n2. You didn't hold it on day i-1, but you buy it on day i, paying the price. So your profit is (unhold[i-1] - price[i]).\n\nSo hold[i] is the max of these two.\n\nFor unhold[i], it's the maximum profit you can have if you are not holding the stock on day i.\n\nThat could be either:\n\n1. You were not holding it on day i-1, so you do nothing\u2014unhold[i-1].\n\n2. You were holding it on day i-1, and you decide to sell it on day i, but this incurs a transaction fee. So your profit is (hold[i-1] + price[i]) - fee.\n\nWait, because when you sell, you add the price[i], but you have to subtract the fee for the transaction.\n\nSo combining these, the recurrence relations are as above.\n\nLet's test with some examples.\n\nTake a sample input.\n\nSuppose prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nDay 0: price is 1.\n\nIf we buy, then we have hold[0] = -1 (since initial profit is zero minus the price). unhold[0] remains zero.\n\nWait, no, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nhold[i] represents the maximum profit after day i and you are holding the stock.\n\nSo the initial state before any days are processed is perhaps hold[0] = -prices[0], and unhold[0] = 0?\n\nNot entirely. Because initially, you can choose to buy on the first day or not.\n\nWait, perhaps initial values:\n\nhold[0] = -prices[0] (you bought on day 0)\n\nunhold[0] = 0 (you didn't buy, so profit is 0)\n\nBut maybe when i=0, it's impossible to sell, so unhold[0] is the max of not holding on that day.\n\nWait, maybe I should initialize hold as -infinity except for the first day.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial state is:\n\nhold = -infinity, unhold = 0.\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, for i=0 (the first day), hold is unhold[0] - price[0], but unhold[0] could be zero if you start without any transaction.\n\nBut this might not be the right way.\n\nLet me think of the problem for the first few days.\n\nAnother approach: for each day i, we track if we are holding or not.\n\nAt i=0:\n\nIf you hold, then you must have bought it earlier, but since it's the first day, you can buy it for price[i], so the profit of holding is initial_profit_0_holding = -prices[0].\n\nIf you don't hold, your profit is 0, since you didn't buy.\n\nAt i=1:\n\nIf you decide to buy, you can only buy if you weren't holding before.\n\nSo hold[1] = max( hold[0], unhold[0] - prices[1] )\n\nWhich is max( -1, 0 -3 ) \u2192 max(-1,-3) \u2192 -1.\n\nunhold[1] = max( unhold[0], hold[0] + prices[1] - fee )\n\nSo unhold[1] is max(0, (-1)+3 -2) \u2192 max(0, 0) \u2192 0.\n\nThen, if on day 2, the price is 2.\n\nhold[2] = max(hold[1], unhold[1]-2) \u2192 max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192 -1.\n\nunhold[2] = max(unhold[1], (hold[1]+2)-fee) \u2192 hold[1] is -1, so -1+2=1, 1-2 (fee) is -1. So unhold[2] is max(0, -1) \u2192 0.\n\nNow day 3 price is 8.\n\nhold[3] = max( hold[2], unhold[2]-8 ) \u2192 max(-1, 0-8=-8) \u2192 -1.\n\nunhold[3] = max( unhold[2], hold[2] + 8 - fee )\n\nhold[2] is -1 \u2192 -1+8=7, minus fee 2 \u2192 5. So max(0, 5) \u21925. So unhold becomes 5.\n\nSo on day 3, the max profit is 5.\n\nMoving to day 4 price 4.\n\nhold[4] = max( -1, 5 -4 \u2192 1) \u21921 is bigger.\n\nSo now, if I buy on day4, I get a hold profit of 1.\n\nunhold[4] = max(5, 1+4-2=3) \u2192 max(5,3) is still 5.\n\nSo unhold remains 5.\n\nThen day 5 price 9.\n\nhold[5] = max(1,5-9=-4 \u2192 max still 1.\n\nunhold[5] = max(5, 1+9-2=8 \u2192 so unhold becomes 8.\n\nSo final profit is 8.\n\nBut let's see if that's the correct maximum.\n\nWhat's the actual best path of transactions?\n\nIn the sample prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee 2.\n\nSo the possible transactions:\n\n-buy on day 1 (price 1), sell on day3 (8), profit is 8-1 -2=5.\n\nThen buy on day4 (price 4), sell on day5 (9), profit is 9-4 -2=3. Total 5+3=8.\n\nWhich is the same as the DP result.\n\nSo the DP seems to capture that.\n\nAnother possible path: buy on day0, sell day1 (3-1=2, minus fee 2 \u21920). Then buy day1 (3), sell day3: 8-3=5, minus fee is 3. Total of 0+3=3.\n\nOr buy day0, sell day3: 8-1=7 minus fee 2 is 5, then day4 to day5: 5 in profit. Hmm wait, that's the earlier path. So 5 (from day1 sale) plus 3 (from day5 sale) is 8.\n\nSo the model seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is, for each i, we calculate hold[i] and unhold[i], based on the previous values.\n\nNow, about the code.\n\nSince for space optimization, since each step only relies on the previous step's values, we don't need an array for all days. We can keep track with variables.\n\nSo we can use variables current_hold and current_unhold.\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_hold = -prices[0]\n\ncurrent_unhold = 0\n\nThen, for each price in prices[1:], do:\n\nnew_hold = max( current_hold, current_unhold - price )\n\nnew_unhold = max( current_unhold, current_hold + price - fee )\n\nThen, set current_hold = new_hold, current_unhold = new_unhold.\n\nWait, let me check. For each day after the first, prices[1:].\n\nWait, for the initial step, after day 0 (the first day), what about day 1?\n\nIn Python, if we loop through prices starting from index 1:\n\nfor price in prices[1:]:\n\nso for each of these, compute new_hold and new_unhold.\n\nBut then I'm considering each price in order.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial values are set based on day 0, and then for each subsequent day (from day 1 to day n-1), we calculate new values.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the prices list is empty? But according to constraints, it's at least length 1.\n\nWait, looking at the code signature, the function is called with prices: List[int], which can have length >=1.\n\nSo, we need to handle cases with length 1. For example, in that case, the max profit is 0, since you cannot sell without buying.\n\nSo, for n ==1, the function should return 0.\n\nSo the code should first handle the case where len(prices) < 2: return 0.\n\nOtherwise, initialize hold and unhold for day 0, then loop starting from day 1.\n\nLet me write code sketch.\n\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if len(prices) < 2:\n        return 0\n    hold = -prices[0]  # bought on day 0\n    unhold = 0\n    for price in prices[1:]:\n        new_hold = max(hold, unhold - price)\n        new_unhold = max(unhold, hold + price - fee)\n        hold, unhold = new_hold, new_unhold\n    return unhold\n\nWait, is this correct?\n\nWait, let's test with the sample.\n\nSample:\n\nprices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee=2.\n\nInitial:\n\nhold = -1, unhold=0.\n\nDay1: price=3\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-3)=-1\n\nnew_unhold= max(0, -1+3-2)=max(0, 0)=0.\n\nhold is now -1, unhold 0.\n\nDay2: price=2\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192 -1\n\nnew_unhold: max(0, -1+2-2) \u2192 -1 \u2192 0.\n\nSo after day 2, unhold is 0.\n\nLet me calculate each step:\n\nWait, maybe I should recompute the steps.\n\nLet's compute again:\n\nAfter day 0:\n\nhold = -1, unhold =0.\n\nDay1: price 3.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-3= -3) \u2192 max(-1, -3) \u2192-1.\n\nnew_unhold = max(0, (-1) +3 -2= 0) \u2192 0.\n\nSo hold = -1, unhold=0.\n\nDay2: price 2.\n\nnew_hold = max( -1, 0-2= -2 ) \u2192-1.\n\nnew_unhold = max(0, -1+2 -2= -1) \u21920.\n\nSo hold is -1, unhold 0.\n\nDay3: price 8.\n\nnew_hold = max( -1, 0 -8 =-8 ) \u2192 -1.\n\nnew_unhold = max(0, (-1)+8 -2=5) \u21925.\n\nSo hold is -1, unhold is5.\n\nDay4: price4.\n\nnew_hold = max( -1, 5-4=1 ) \u21921.\n\nnew_unhold= max(5, (-1)+4-2=1 ) \u21925.\n\nSo hold is1, unhold5.\n\nDay5: price9.\n\nnew_hold= max(1, 5-9= -4 ) \u21921.\n\nnew_unhold= max(5, 1 +9 -2=8) \u21928.\n\nSo unhold is 8, so the function returns 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nHmm, okay, that seems to work.\n\nAnother sample: let's think when it's optimal to not sell.\n\nprices = [2,1,2,0,1], fee = 0.\n\nSo with fee 0, maximum profit is to buy at 2 days and sell when prices are higher.\n\nWait, prices is 2,1,2,0,1.\n\nThe possible transactions without fee would be:\n\nbuy at 2 for 1, sell at 4-1-1 (or something). Or perhaps just buy low and sell high.\n\nIf fee is 0, this reduces to the classic maximum profit with multiple transactions.\n\nWait, the maximum profit is 1 + (2-0) + (1) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I think in this case without fees, the maximum is achieved by buying and selling whenever it's profitable on consecutive days.\n\nWait, with fee 0, the function should return the sum of all increases in the prices.\n\nLet me compute.\n\nBut for this case, what is the best profit?\n\nBuy on day 1 (1), sell on day 2 (2) \u2192 +1.\n\nThen buy on day 3 (0), sell on day 4 (1) \u2192+1.\n\nTotal profit 2.\n\nBut in the code above, for each transaction, perhaps it is considering the fee. So with fee 0, let's see.\n\nAfter initializing:\n\nhold = -2.\n\nunhold=0.\n\nDay1: price1 is1.\n\nnew_hold: max(-2, 0-1=-1) \u2192-1.\n\nnew_unhold: max(0, -2+1 -0= -1) \u21920.\n\nSo hold is -1, unhold=0.\n\nDay2: price=2.\n\nnew_hold: max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192-1.\n\nnew_unhold: max(0, ( -1 )+2-0=1) so unhold becomes1.\n\nDay3: price=0.\n\nnew_hold= max(-1, 1-0=1) \u21921.\n\nnew_unhold: max(1, 1+0 -0=1) \u21921.\n\nDay4: price 1.\n\nnew_hold= max(1, 1-1=0) \u21921.\n\nnew_unhold= max(1, 1+ 1 -0=2 \u21922.\n\nSo at the end, unhold is2 \u2192 which is correct.\n\nSo the code would return2, which is correct.\n\nSo the DP seems to handle multiple transactions.\n\nSo the code looks correct.\n\nAnother test case: fee higher than possible gains.\n\nprices = [5,4,3], fee=1.\n\nThe maximum profit is 0, since each sell would lose plus the fee. So the function should return 0.\n\nLet's see:\n\nDay0: hold =-5, unhold 0.\n\nDay1: price 4.\n\nnew_hold= max(-5, 0-4=-4) \u2192-4.\n\nnew_unhold= max(0, (-5)+4-1 =-2 \u21920.\n\nSo hold=-4, unhold=0.\n\nDay2: price3.\n\nnew_hold= max(-4,0-3=-3) \u2192-3.\n\nnew_unhold= max(0, -4+3 -1 =-2 \u21920.\n\nSo function returns0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle various cases.\n\nWhat about if the prices are increasing but with a fee.\n\nLike prices = [1, 4, 5], fee=1.\n\nPossible transactions: buy at 1, sell at4 for 3 profit, subtracting fee 1: 2. Then buy at4, sell at5: 1 -1 (fee) \u21920. Total 2.\n\nAlternatively, buy at1, sell at5:4 \u2192 minus 1 gives3. So that's better.\n\nSo in the code, what's the calculation.\n\nInitial:\n\nhold =-1, unhold=0.\n\nDay1: price4.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-4= -4) \u2192-1.\n\nnew_unhold = max(0, (-1)+4 -1=2).\n\nSo unhold becomes2.\n\nDay2: price5.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 2-5= -3 \u2192-1).\n\nnew_unhold= max(2, (-1)+5 -1=3).\n\nSo function returns max(3), which is3. Correct.\n\nSo the function returns3, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo the final code is as sketched above, with edge case handling.\n\nWait, but what if the prices list has only one element?\n\nThe code's initial condition will return0, which is correct.\n\nSo I think that's the right approach.\n\nThus, implementing the function with the logic described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to design a function `maxProfitWithTransactionFee` that calculates the maximum profit from trading a stock given an array of daily prices and a transaction fee. The function allows multiple buy-sell transactions, but each transaction incurs a fee. The goal is to maximize the profit after accounting for these fees.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using dynamic programming (DP) with state transitions to keep track of the maximum profit achievable either by holding the stock or by not holding it on each day. \n\n1. **State Definition**:\n   - `hold[i]`: The maximum profit achievable if we are holding the stock at the end of day `i`.\n   - `unhold[i]`: The maximum profit achievable if we are not holding the stock at the end of day `i`.\n\n2. **State Transitions**:\n   - For `hold[i]`, the value is the maximum of either continuing to hold the stock from the previous day or buying it today if we were not holding it previously (after paying the transaction fee).\n   - For `unhold[i]`, the value is the maximum of either continuing to not hold the stock from the previous day or selling the stock today if we were holding it (after paying the transaction fee).\n\n3. **Initialization**:\n   - Start with `hold` initialized to `-prices[0]` (simulating buying the stock on the first day) and `unhold` initialized to `0` (since no transactions have occurred yet).\n\n4. **Iterate through each day**:\n   - Update `hold` and `unhold` values based on the current day's price and the previous day's `hold` and `unhold` values.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the list of prices has fewer than two days, the maximum profit is zero since at least one buy-sell pair is needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if len(prices) < 2:\n        return 0\n    \n    hold = -prices[0]\n    unhold = 0\n    \n    for price in prices[1:]:\n        new_hold = max(hold, unhold - price)\n        new_unhold = max(unhold, hold + price - fee)\n        \n        hold, unhold = new_hold, new_unhold\n    \n    return unhold\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit using dynamic programming with constant space complexity. By maintaining two variables, `hold` and `unhold`, the algorithm updates these values iteratively for each day's price, considering both the decision to hold or sell the stock. This ensures that each day's optimal profit is computed based on the previous day's state, leading to an overall optimal solution. The final result is the maximum profit achievable without holding the stock at the end of the last day, as this state encapsulates all possible transactions made.",
