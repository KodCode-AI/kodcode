  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to implement a CircularQueue class in Python, right? Hmm, where do I even start? I remember that a circular queue uses an array and some pointers to manage the elements. Oh right, because when you dequeue an element, you don't shift all the elements down, which would take O(n) time. Instead, you just move the front pointer.\n\nLet me think about the properties. The queue will have elements, but it wraps around a fixed-size buffer. So, the main thing is to keep track of the front, rear, and maybe the current size. Oh right, because the size will help me determine if the queue is full or empty at any given time.\n\nWait, the operations need to be O(1) time. So enQueue and deQueue should add/remove elements in constant time. That makes sense because it's just about updating pointers and the size variable.\n\nSo for the data structure, maybe I'll use a list in Python to represent the circular array. And I'll need variables for front, rear, and current size. The max size will be given when the constructor is called.\n\nLet me jot down the operations one by one and how to handle them.\n\nFirst, the constructor: CircularQueue(int k) will create a queue with maximum size k. So in the __init__ method, I'll initialize the data structure with a list of size k, all initialized to maybe None or some default value to represent empty slots. Also, set front and rear pointers. Hmm, where do they start? Maybe front starts at 0, rear starts at 0 as well. But I'll also need a size variable to track how many elements are in the queue. So when size is 0, the queue is empty.\n\nWait, wait, that's another consideration: how to distinguish between \"the slot is empty\" and \"the slot is at the end\". Maybe when the size is zero, it's empty. For other cases, when a slot is None, but size might not be zero, but maybe that's not the case. Hmm, I might need to manage the storage such that I don't have to check individual elements. So when an element is enqueued, the rear is moved, and when dequeued, the front is moved. So the size variable alone should be sufficient to know if it's empty or full.\n\nSo initializing: data = [None] * k, front = 0, rear = 0, size = 0.\n\nNext, the Front() method. It should return the element at the front if the queue isn't empty. Otherwise, return -1. So I can check if size == 0. If yes, return -1. Else, return data[front].\n\nSame for Rear(). Also returns data[rear] if size is not zero, else -1.\n\nEnqueue method: This should add a value to the rear. But before that, check if the queue is full. How? If size == k, return false. Otherwise, add the value to data[rear], then move rear forward. But since it's circular, moving rear wraps around using modulo. Also, increment size. So the steps are: if(size >= k) return False, else data[rear] = value; rear = (rear + 1) mod k; size +=1. Then return True.\n\nWait, how is the modulo applied? Let's see: if the current rear is at position k-1, adding 1 takes it to 0. So yes, use (rear + 1) % k?\n\nSame for dequeue. Dequeue removes the element at the front. How? You don't necessarily remove it, but just mark the front as moving forward. So if the size is zero, return False. Else, set front to (front +1 ) % k, and decrement size. Return True.\n\nWait, but in the dequeue operation, according to the problem statement, deQueue() deletes an element. So the function returns whether it was successful. So the size and front pointer should be updated accordingly.\n\nWait, but the implementation is a bit tricky. For example, when we dequeue, we just advance the front pointer, but how do we know that? Because moving front ahead signifies that the element is no longer part of the queue. So size is decreased by one, right.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, isEmpty() just returns whether size is zero. And isFull() returns whether size is equal to the maximum size.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me think about edge cases. Because the front and rear can be at the same position in some cases.\n\nFor example, when the queue is full: front is at the same position as rear, and the queue is full.\n\nWhen the queue is empty, front and rear are both at 0 (or whatever initial position), but the size is zero.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking full or empty, the size variable is the main indicator. So whether the queue is empty can be determined by size ==0, and full by size == k.\n\nHmm, okay, makes sense.\n\nSo now, putting this all together.\n\nLet me outline the variables:\n\n- data: list of size k, initialized to None.\n- front: initially 0\n- rear: initially 0\n- size: initially 0\n- the maximum size is k, passed in.\n\nSo in __init__:\ndef __init__(self, k):\n    self.k = k\n    self.data = [None] * k\n    self.front = 0\n    self.rear = 0\n    self.size = 0\n\nThen, Front() function:\n\ndef Front(self):\n    if self.isEmpty():\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return self.data[self.front]\n\nSimilarly, the Rear():\n\ndef Rear(self):\n    if self.isEmpty():\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return self.data[self.rear]\n\nEnQueue:\n\ndef enQueue(self, value):\n    if self.isFull():\n        return False\n    self.data[self.rear] = value\n    self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.k\n    self.size +=1\n    return True\n\nDeQueue:\n\ndef deQueue(self):\n    if self.isEmpty():\n        return False\n    self.front = (self.front +1) % self.k\n    self.size -=1\n    return True\n\nWait, but when we dequeue, what happens to the data? Do we need to set data[front] to None? Hmm, that's a good point. Otherwise, if someone calls Front() again, they'll see the old value.\n\nWait no, because once you dequeue, the front is advanced, so the previous front's data is invalid for new Enqueues.\n\nWait, let me take an example:\n\nSuppose k=3. Initially, front=0, rear=0, size=0.\n\nEnqueue 1: rear becomes 1, data[0] =1, size=1.\n\nEnqueue 2: rear becomes 2, data[1]=2, size=2.\n\nEnqueue 3: rear becomes 0 (because (2+1)%3=0), data[2]=3, size=3.\n\nNow, if I dequeue once: front increments to 1, size=2. So the data's structure is [1,2,3], but the front is 1. So Front() returns 2, Rear() returns 3.\n\nSo when a user calls Front, they get the next element. Rear returns the last element.\n\nSo the data when we dequeue is not overwritten. Hmm, but enQueue can overwrite if called.\n\nWait, for example, after a dequeue, the front is at 1. Then, when we enQueue another element, let's say 4, since the queue wasn't full. Rear is at 0 (from before deQueue and size is 2). So rear moves to (0+1) %3=1. Data[0] is now 4. So data is [4,2,3].\n\nWait, no: Wait, after deQueue, size becomes 2. So, initial data [1,2,3], after front increments to 1.\n\nRear is at 0. When enQueue is called, the data at rear (0) is set to 4. So data becomes [4,2,3], front is 1, rear is 1, size is 3?\n\nWait, let me think: When enQueue is called when size is 2:\n\nself.rear starts at 0. Enqueue is allowed because the size wasn't full.\n\nSet data[0] to value, then rear becomes (0+1) mod 3=1. size increases to 3.\n\nSo data is [4,2,3], and front is 1, rear is 1.\n\nSo the next dequeue would make front 2, size 2.\n\nWait, but in that case, data[1] is 2 and data[2] is 3.\n\nHmm. So the problem here is that enQueue could overwrite the front. Wait, no, because when the queue is not full. Or wait, in the example above, after deQueue when the data was [1,2,3], size becomes 2, so the elements are considered to be 2 and 3, not 1.\n\nSo, in enQueue, when we add 4, we place it at index 0, which was the position where 1 was, but since the front is now 1, that is the head of the queue. So, the element at index 0 is considered tail, because rear is moving.\n\nSo, the data[0] can hold the last enqueued element. So, in this case, does that mean that when you have a full queue, you can't enqueue anymore, which is correct.\n\nSo, the enQueue and deQueue functions don't require zeroing or setting to None the data when elements are removed. Because, when the front is moved, the Front() function only returns data[front], which is the next element in the queue.\n\nTherefore, the logic for Front() and Rear() will correctly return the first and last elements of the logical queue, despite possibly having older data in other positions.\n\nWait, but let me think: if you have a queue where you've enqueued in and out multiple times, but the data array holds older elements in some positions. When you call Front(), after several deQueues, Front() returns data[front], which is the correct current head of the queue.\n\nSo that's okay because the rear would be moving to indicate the next available spot.\n\nSo, for Front() and Rear(), as long as the size is maintained correctly, those functions will return the correct values, because front and rear are the pointers to the current head and tail.\n\nThus, perhaps setting data[front] to something when dequeueing is not necessary, because once front moves, that element is no longer considered part of the queue.\n\nSo yes, the functions are correct as is.\n\nSo, testing:\n\nLet's say k=3.\n\nInitialize:\n\ndata = [None, None, None]\n\nfront = 0, rear=0, size=0.\n\nEnqueue 1:\n\ndata becomes [1, None, None], rear becomes 1, size=1.\n\nEnqueue 2: data[1]=2, rear becomes 2, size=2.\n\nEnqueue 3: rear becomes 0, data[2]=3 becomes 3. So data is [1, 2, 3]. size is 3.\n\nNow, call deQueue(); it should return true. Now, front becomes 1, size is 2.\n\nNow, call Rear(). The rear is 0, so returns data[0]=1? No, wait, no. Because size is 2, so data[rear] is 1, but is that correct?\n\nWait, because after deQueue, front is 1, and data is [1,2,3], but the elements in the queue are considered to be 2 and 3. So the rear is at 0, which was the last enqueued element, which is 1, but wait, that's because 3 was enqueued and rear was at 2+1 mod3=0. Hmm.\n\nWait no, sorry, in the enQueue operation, after 3 is added, the rear is 0. Then, after deQueue, front becomes 1.\n\nSo, the current queue has two elements: 2 at index 1, and 3 at index 2.\n\nWhen Rear is called, it should return 3, which is data[2].\n\nWait, but in my code, Rear() returns data[rear], which is data[0] since rear is 0.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the example, after enqueuing until the queue is full, then dequeuing once, the front is at 1. rear is 0. So when Rear() is called, it should return data[0], but actually the last element is 3, which is at index 2.\n\nSo my code for Rear() is wrong.\n\nAh! This indicates a mistake in my initial reasoning. Because Rear() should return the last element enqueued, which is the element at rear -1 (mod k?), or perhaps instead, Rear() is updated when enqueued, which is the index of where it was added, so rear is pointing to the next position. So when you enqueue, data[rear] is set first, then rear is incremented.\n\nSo, the rear is indicating the next available spot. So the last element is rear-1.\n\nSo, in our example, after dequeue, the data at front is 1 (index 0) is no longer part of the queue, but the rear is at 0. So the last element was at index 2, which is 3.\n\nSo Rear() should return data[ (rear -1) % k ] because rear is the next position to write. So when the queue isn't empty, that's how we get the last element.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So let me think.\n\nWhen you enqueue a value, you set data[rear] to the value, then rear becomes (rear+1) %k. So, the data is stored at rear, and then rear moves to the next slot.\n\nSo, the last element is at (rear -1) %k, because rear is pointing to the next position.\n\nSimilarly, the front is the index of the next element to dequeue.\n\nSo, in the initial state: rear is 0. So when the queue is empty, (rear -1) mod k is 2 (because 0-1 is -1, mod 3 is 2).\n\nWait, but on starting, the queue is empty. So in that case, rear is zero, but Front() would return -1 because size is zero.\n\nThis suggests that the current approach to Rear() is incorrect. Because when rear is 0, the last element is at 2 (in a 3-element queue). So data[rear] is zero, but data[2] has the value.\n\nSo, the Rear() function should in fact return data[ (rear - 1) %k ], not data[rear].\n\nThat makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nSo in the Rear() function:\n\nif the queue is empty, return -1.\n\nElse, the position is (rear -1) %k. And return data at that position.\n\nSimilarly, in Front(), it's data[front].\n\nSo, in that case, in my example after enqueuing 3 elements:\n\nenqueue 1, data[0] =1, rear=1.\n\nenqueue 2, data[1]=2, rear=2.\n\nenqueue 3, data[2]=3, rear=(2+1)%3=0.\n\nNow, Rear() would be (0-1) mod3 = 2. data[2] is 3. Correct.\n\nThen, dequeue once: front becomes 1. data is [1,2,3], size is 2.\n\nSo Rear() would return data[ (0-1) mod3 ] = 2 \u2192 3. Correct.\n\n.front is 1, so Front() is 2. Correct.\n\nWait, but what about enqueuing again after deQueue?\n\nIn the state where front=1, rear=0, size=2.\n\nEnqueue 4. Since size is 2 <3, it's okay.\n\ndata[0] =4, rear=(0+1)%3 \u2192 1. size becomes 3.\n\nNow the queue is full.\n\nFront is 1, Rear is 1. So, Rear() would be (1-1) mod3 =0 \u2192 data[0]=4. Correct.\n\nDequeue once \u2192 front increments to 2, size 2.\n\nSo queue is 4, 2, 3 \u2192 wait, no, let's see.\n\nHmm, wait, the data after enqueuing 4 is [4,2,3]. front is 1. So when I call Front(), I get 2. Dequeue makes front 2. Then Rear is (1-1) mod3=0 \u2192 data[0]=4. So, Rear() returns 4? But in the queue after deQueue, the elements are 3 and 4, because front is 2.\n\nWait, I think I've got it wrong.\n\nLet me think through this again.\n\nAfter enqueuing 4: data is [4,2,3]. Rear is 1.\n\nSo, the queue is full. front is 1, rear is 1, size 3.\n\nBut then dequeue: front is incremented to 2 mod3 \u21922. size becomes 2.\n\nSo, the queue has 3 and 4.\n\n FRONT() returns data[2]=3.\n\nRear is 1, so Rear() returns data[ (1-1)=0 ] \u2192 data[0]=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo when someone calls Rear(), they get 4 as the rear element, which is correct.\n\nSo, the mistake in my initial code was that Rear() function was returning data[rear], but it should return data[ (rear -1) %k ].\n\nSo I need to adjust that.\n\nTherefore, in the code:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n    if self.isEmpty():\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return self.data[ (self.rear -1) % self.k ]\n\nWait, but in case when the queue's rear is 0, like in the initial full queue, rear is 0, so (0-1) mod3 is 2 \u2192 when data is [1,2,3], returns 3, correct.\n\nSo, now the Rear() function is correct.\n\nWhat about when the queue is empty? Then, returns -1.\n\nWait, but what about the mistake I made earlier, is that the Rear() function was using rear, but rear is pointing to the next position available. So it's been fixed now.\n\nSo, updating the code.\n\nNow, Front() is correct.\n\nWhat about when an element is dequeued, front is incremented, but data still has the value.\n\nWait, that's correct, because the elements are undamaged until overwritten by a new enqueue.\n\nBut in the queue, the elements are not removed, but front is moved.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, another edge case: when the queue is empty, and someone calls Front() and Rear(), both should return -1.\n\nAnother situation: after multiple enqueues and dequeues.\n\nFor example, when the queue is empty, then enqueued 1, but then dequeued. So size is zero.\n\nThus, Front and Rear will return -1.\n\nNow, thinking about the deQueue() function. It only advances the front pointer and decreases the size.\n\nWhat about when the queue becomes empty after a dequeue?\n\nIf the size was 1 and someone calls deQueue, then size becomes 0. So the next enQueue can start from front= (original front +1) mod k, and so on.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAnother thing: the circular queue can have wrap-around for both front and rear.\n\nWhat about when the queue has elements wrapped around.\n\nFor example, with k=3: enqueued 1,2,3. Then dequeued 1, then enqueued4.\n\nNow, queue has 2,3,4. Front is at 1, Rear is at 1 (no, wait: in dequeue when front was 0, front is incremented to 1. Then enqueued4: data[1]=4, rear= 2.\n\nWait, no. Because after dequeuing 1 (k=3):\n\nbefore dequeue: front=0, rear=0 (wait no, that's after enqueueing 3).\n\nWait, when the queue is full, after enqueues 1,2,3, front is 0, rear is 0, size is3.\n\nThen dequeue: front becomes 1, size 2.\n\nSo, Rear is 0. So when someone enqueues 4: since size is 2 <3, allowed.\n\ndata[0]=4, then rear becomes (0+1) mod3=1. size becomes3.\n\nThus, data is [4, None, 3]?\n\nWait, no, because when we dequeued once, data was [1,2,3], front was 1, then enqueued 4: data[rear] is data[0] (since rear was 0 before enqueuing), set to 4, then rear increments to 1.\n\nSo, data is [4,2,3], front is 1, rear is1, size is3.\n\nNow, if we call Rear(), it returns data[ (1-1) mod3=0 ] \u21924, correct.\n\nFront() returns data[1]=2.\n\nSo, many scenarios are handled correctly now.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nk=3\n\nEnqueue 1: front=0, rear=1, data [1,None, None]\n\nEnqueue 2: rear=2, data [1,2,None]\n\nEnqueue 3: rear=0, data[2]=3 \u2192 [1,2,3]\n\nDequeue once: front becomes1, size=2.\n\nWhat is Rear()? (0-1) mod3=2 \u21923.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code now seems correct.\n\nNow, how about a single element queue.\n\nk=1.\n\nEnqueue 1: data[0]=1, rear=0, size=1.\n\nDequeue: front becomes (0+1) mod1=0, size 0.\n\nEnqueue 2: allowed, since size was 0. data[0]=2, rear= (0+1) mod1=0, size=1.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nSo Front() returns 2, Rear() returns2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nIn Python, the % is the modulo operator.\n\nSo, in Rear():\n\ndef Rear(self):\n    if self.isEmpty():\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return self.data[(self.rear -1) % self.k]\n\nWait, but in Python, (rear-1) %k can't be negative, but in Python modulo handles negative numbers correctly.\n\nFor example, (0-1) %3 is 2.\n\nThus, no issues there.\n\nThus, I think the code is correct.\n\nHmm, but I should write the code for all methods.\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nclass CircularQueue:\n\n    def __init__(self, k):\n        self.k = k\n        self.data = [None] * k\n        self.front = 0\n        self.rear = 0\n        self.size =0\n\n    def Front(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        else:\n            return self.data[self.front]\n\n    def Rear(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        else:\n            return self.data[ (self.rear-1) % self.k ]\n\n    def enQueue(self, value):\n        if self.isFull():\n            return False\n        self.data[self.rear] = value\n        self.rear = (self.rear +1) % self.k\n        self.size +=1\n        return True\n\n    def deQueue(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return False\n        self.front = (self.front +1 ) % self.k\n        self.size -=1\n        return True\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return self.size ==0\n\n    def isFull(self):\n        return self.size == self.k\n\nWait, but I have a potential issue in enQueue and deQueue when the queue is full.\n\nLet me think: in enQueue, when size is at k, you cannot enqueue.\n\nBut looking at the code, that's correctly handled.\n\nAnother thing: when the queue is written as [None] *k, that is filled with None. Thus, in the Front and Rear functions, the data is accessed, which could return None, but only when the queue has a size of zero is it considered empty. Otherwise, the data could have Nones, but I think that's correct, because when you enqueue, you set the data to the value. So when someone enqueues, the None are replaced by the values, and the front and rear are correctly set.\n\nWait, no. Because if you enqueue an element, then dequeue, then enqueue again, the data elements do reset. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if someone enqueues, dequeues multiple times, and then enqueues again? Let's see.\n\nFor example:\n\nk=2.\n\nEnqueue 1: data[0]=1, rear=1, size 1.\n\nEnqueue 2: data[1]=2, rear=0, size 2.\n\nDequeue: front \u21921, size 1.\n\nDequeue: front \u21922 %2 \u21920, size 0.\n\nEnqueue 3: since size 0, ok.\n\ndata[0] =3, rear=1, size1.\n\nRear: (1-1) mod2=0 \u2192 data[0]=3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThus, the code handles all these cases.\n\nAnother thing to think about: when enqueuing, data is set first, then rear is incremented. So for the new element, it is correctly positioned.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nTest Case:\n\nTest 1: All operations example.\n\nqueue = CircularQueue(3)\nqueue.enQueue(1)\nqueue.enQueue(2)\nqueue.enQueue(3)\nprint(queue.Rear()) # should return3\nqueue.deQueue()\nprint(queue.Rear()) # should return3\nqueue.enQueue(4)\nprint(queue.Front()) # should return2 as front is 1\nprint(queue.Rear()) # returns4, as (1-1) mod3=0 \u2192 data[0]=4\nqueue.deQueue()\nprint(queue.Front()) # returns3, because front becomes 2.\nprint(queue.Rear()) # (1-1) mod3=0 \u21923.\nHmm.\n\nWait, after enQueue 4:\n\ndata is [4,2,3]\n\nfront is1, rear is1 (since after enQueue, rear moves to0+1=1 mod3=1.\n\nSo Front() is data[1] \u2192 2.\n\nRear() is data[(1-1) mod3 \u21920: data[0] is4.\n\nThen, deQueue is called: front becomes 2, size 1.\n\nSo data is [4,2,3], front is2, size is1.\n\nThen Rear() \u2192(1-1) \u21920 mod3=0 \u21924.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correctly handling all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a CircularQueue class that supports various queue operations efficiently, with all operations performed in constant time (O(1)). A circular queue is a data structure that uses an array to store elements, and it allows the rear to wrap around to the front when the array is full. This ensures that the queue can reuse the space freed by dequeuing elements without shifting all elements down, which would take O(n) time.\n\n### Approach\nThe key idea is to use three pointers to manage the queue efficiently:\n1. `front`: Points to the front of the queue (the next element to be dequeued).\n2. `rear`: Points to the next available position to enqueue a new element.\n3. `size`: Keeps track of the number of elements currently in the queue.\n\nThe CircularQueue class is initialized with a maximum size `k`. The operations supported are:\n- `Front()`: Retrieves the element at the front without removing it.\n- `Rear()`: Retrieves the element at the rear without removing it.\n- `enQueue(value)`: Adds an element to the queue if there is space.\n- `deQueue()`: Removes an element from the front of the queue if the queue is not empty.\n- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.\n- `isFull()`: Checks if the queue is full.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass CircularQueue:\n    def __init__(self, k):\n        self.k = k\n        self.data = [None] * k\n        self.front = 0\n        self.rear = 0\n        self.size = 0\n\n    def Front(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        else:\n            return self.data[self.front]\n\n    def Rear(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        else:\n            return self.data[(self.rear - 1) % self.k]\n\n    def enQueue(self, value):\n        if self.isFull():\n            return False\n        self.data[self.rear] = value\n        self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.k\n        self.size += 1\n        return True\n\n    def deQueue(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return False\n        self.front = (self.front + 1) % self.k\n        self.size -= 1\n        return True\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return self.size == 0\n\n    def isFull(self):\n        return self.size == self.k\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the queue with a given size `k`, creating an array `data` of size `k` initialized with `None`. The `front` and `rear` pointers start at 0, and `size` is 0, indicating an empty queue.\n- **Front()**: Returns the element at the `front` index of the array if the queue is not empty; otherwise, returns -1.\n- **Rear()**: Returns the element just before the `rear` pointer (i.e., the last element in the queue) using modulo arithmetic to handle wrap-around.\n- **enQueue(value)**: Checks if the queue is full. If not, it adds the value to the position pointed by `rear`, updates `rear` to the next position, and increments `size`.\n- **deQueue()**: Checks if the queue is empty. If not, it moves the `front` pointer to the next position (using modulo arithmetic) and decrements `size`.\n- **isEmpty()**: Returns `True` if `size` is 0, indicating the queue is empty.\n- **isFull()**: Returns `True` if `size` equals `k`, indicating the queue is full.\n\nThis implementation ensures all operations are performed in constant time, making it efficient for use cases requiring frequent enqueue and dequeue operations.",
