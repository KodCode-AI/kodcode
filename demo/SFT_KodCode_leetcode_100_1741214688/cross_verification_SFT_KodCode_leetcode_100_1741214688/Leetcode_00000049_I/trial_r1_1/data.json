  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given an integer array nums and a target integer. The task is to find the shortest contiguous subarray in nums such that the sum of its elements is equal to or greater than the target. If such a subarray doesn't exist, I return 0.\n\nHmm, first, I should understand the problem properly. So, a contiguous subarray has to have at least two elements. That means I can't consider single-element subarrays, even if their sum meets the target.\n\nLet me think about some examples. Suppose nums is [1,4,2,2,1], target is 7. What's the shortest subarray here? Let's see: 4+2=6, which is less than 7. 1+4+2=7 exactly, so their sum is equal to target. So the length here is 3. Are there any shorter? Well, maybe 2+2+1=5 <7, 4+2+2+1=9, that's 4 elements. So yes, [1,4,2] is a possible answer.\n\nWait, is that the shortest? Or is there a subarray with two elements that sum >= 7? Let me check the pairs. The first two: 1+4=5 <7. Then 4+2=6 <7. 2+2=4 <7. 2+1=3. So no, the minimum here is 3 elements. So the answer is 3.\n\nAnother example: nums = [2,3,1,2], target = 6. Let's see. Pairs: 2+3=5<6, 3+1=4<6, 1+2=3<6. Triplets: 2+3+1=6, so length 3. Also, 3+1+2=6. So the answer would be 3?\n\nWait, but wait, is there a single two-element subarray that meets the target? Oh, wait. Let me calculate again. 3+3=6 in any case. Wait, no, the nums here are [2,3,1,2]. So possible two-element subarrays are 3 and 1 is 4, 1+2 is 3. 2 and 3 is 5. Hmm, no two-element subarray meets 6. So the minimal is 3, like [2,3,1] or [3,1,2].\n\nSo the answer is 3. So how do I approach this problem?\n\nFirst approach: the brute-force way. I can iterate through all possible contiguous subarrays, calculate their sums, and keep track of the minimum length for those that meet or exceed the target.\n\nBut wait, for a large array, this would be O(n^2) time, which might be acceptable, but perhaps for very large n, it's not efficient. But given the problem constraints, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think: maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a sliding window approach. But for that to work, we need the elements to be positive, because otherwise, adding elements can cause the sum to not have the monotonicity required for the sliding window.\n\nWait, the problem says \"integer\" array. So nums can have negative numbers. Hmm, that complicates things. Because a sliding window approach works well with all positive numbers, but with negative numbers, it's tricky.\n\nLet me think: Since we're looking for subarrays where sum >= target, and if the array can have negative numbers, then I can't use a sliding window approach directly because expanding the window when the sum is below target may not work.\n\nSo maybe the brute force approach is needed, but perhaps we can optimize it.\n\nWait, perhaps a prefix sum approach can help. Prefix sum is an array P where P[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, the sum of the subarray from i to j is P[j] - P[i]. So for each j, I want to find the smallest j-i such that P[j] - P[i] >= target, and j-i+1 as small as possible.\n\nBut if the prefix sum is not increasing, since the array can have negative numbers, how can this help us? For positive numbers, P[j] is increasing, so for each j, we can look for the earliest i where P[j] - P[i] >= target, and those would be shorter subarrays.\n\nBut with numbers that can be negative, the prefix sum array is not necessarily increasing. So for a certain j, the P[j] - P[i] needs to be >= target. To find the i that makes this true and gives the smallest possible length (j-i+1), perhaps for each j, I can look back and see if any of the previous P[i] are <= P[j] - target, but that may not be the case for all P[j].\n\nAlternatively, for each j, find the smallest j-i where P[j] - P[i] >= target. To find this, perhaps using some data structure to keep track of P[i], but it's unclear.\n\nWait, but the minimal subarray size is 2. So in this problem, for each possible pair of two elements, and considering larger lengths, perhaps we can find the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute the prefix sum, and for each i, check from i+1 onwards, to see when the sum reaches the required target.\n\nWait, but this could be O(n^2) in the worst case. For example, if the target is a very large number, and every subarray has a sum less than target except maybe the entire array.\n\nSo for a solution, maybe O(n^2) is acceptable. Let's see.\n\nBut is there a way to optimize it? Let me think.\n\nAnother idea: For each starting index i, compute the cumulative sum as we expand j from i. Once the sum is >= target, record the length and break, because adding more elements will only make the subarray longer, so no need to consider longer subarrays starting at i after that point.\n\nBut wait, this assumes that after a certain j, if you add more elements, the sum can't reach the target with a shorter subarray. But in cases where the subarrays can have negative numbers, this might not hold. For example, perhaps a subarray i to j gives sum T, then i to j+1 gives T + some negative number, which could bring it back below target, but i to j+2 might include another element making the sum T again but over a longer subarray. Hmm, no, because we are considering that once we have a sum >= target, we record the length. But wait, no, because for j, after i, the element at j is for i \u2192 j is a two-element subarray. For j+1, it's a three-element, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify.\n\nIf I iterate for each possible starting index i from 0 to n-2, and then for j starting from i+1 to n-1, accumulate the sum until it's >= target. While doing this, for each i, we find the smallest j such that the sum from i to j is >= target, and then we can stop, because any j' > j will only give a larger subarray.\n\nWait, but then when you have a subarray i to j which gives sum >= target, then the length is (j - i + 1). But since the subarrays must be at least two elements, (j - i + 1) will be at least 2.\n\nSo in this approach, for each i, we can calculate the cumulative sum and break once we find j where sum >= target. For all j beyond that point, the subarrays are longer and hence won't provide a shorter solution.\n\nSo the problem is, does this approach miss any possible shorter subarrays that exist even after j?\n\nWait, no. Because for each i, we are considering j up to the first occurrence of sum >= target, so any longer subarrays would only have longer lengths, which we don't want.\n\nSo this is O(n^2) in the worst case, but perhaps acceptable.\n\nLet's think for nums = [10,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. If target is 11, the subarray [10,1] has sum 11, which is minimal.\n\nIn this approach, for i=0, j=1: sum is 11, so length 2. Then proceed to i=1, j=1 starts at i=1, j=2: sum is 2, which is < 11. So have to keep adding until maybe j=10, but that's sum 1*10 =10 <11. Wait, but then that approach would fail.\n\nWait, in the array I gave, target is 11. Then the subarray [10,1] gives sum 11, which is acceptable. So in the first iteration, i=0, j=1, sum=11, so the minimal length is 2.\n\nBut for i=1, j=1 is 1 element, which we skip, since we need i \u2264 j-1, since subarrays need at least two elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the j loop. Wait, my approach is for each i to consider j from i+1 to len(nums)-1. For each i, accumulate the sum, and the first j where sum >= target will give the minimal possible subarray starting at i.\n\nWait, let's take the example [10, 2, -2, 2]. Target is 10.\n\nSo for i=0, j=1: sum is 12 \u226510, so length 2.\n\nFor i=1, j=2: 2-2=0 <10, j=3: 2-2+2=2 <10. So no subarrays starting at i=1 contribute.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the approach would correctly find this.\n\nBut what if in situation where a longer subarray starting at i is needed? Let me see.\n\nSuppose nums = [1, 3, -5, 2], target = 3.\n\nLooking at each i:\n\ni=0: j=1: 1+3=4 \u22653 \u2192 length 2.\n\nBut what if the num array is [3,-1,2], target 3? So [3,-1,2] as nums.\n\nSo for i=0, j=1: 3-1=2 <3. j=2: 3-1+2=4\u22653 \u2192 length 3.\n\nFor i=1, j starts at 2: -1+2=1 <3 \u2192 so not found.\n\ni=2: can't form a subarray of at least 2 elements.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nHmm, but now imagine another case where a longer subarray is the only one that meets the condition.\n\nBut in the approach, this would be handled, because for i=0, it finds j=2 as the first j where the sum is sufficient, and the length is 3. So it's okay.\n\nBut what about when, for a particular i, you have to go beyond a certain j to reach the target.\n\nBut because the approach breaks after finding the first j, it doesn't consider any longer subarrays starting at i. So this would limit the j loop per i to O(n) time, but in practice, often much shorter.\n\nSo the time complexity is O(n^2), which is acceptable for small n, but perhaps in cases where n is 1e5, it's not. But for the purposes of programming problems, n is usually up to 1e4, which makes this approach feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps I should proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over each starting index i, from 0 to len(nums) - 2.\n\n- For each i, compute the sum of elements starting at i, and moving j from i+1 to len(nums) -1.\n\n- Keep adding nums[j] to the current sum.\n\n- At each step, check if the sum is >= target: if yes, compute the length as j - i + 1, record this length, and break out of the j loop for this i, because any further j's would give a longer length.\n\n- Keep track of the minimal length found, initializing it to a large number.\n\n- After processing all i, return the minimal length if found, else 0.\n\nBut what about the order of considering j? For each i, after j starts at i+1, sum is for i to j: but if the sum is achieved at j=i+1, then that's the minimal possible because if any longer subarray includes i, it's longer.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, for i=0, j ranges from 0+1=1, 2, etc.\n\nBut wait, the subarray from 0 to 0 is not considered because it's a single element. So starting j at i+1, and for each i, considering the next elements.\n\nOkay, I think that approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, initialize min_length to some big value, like infinity.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to len(nums)-2:\n\n   current_sum = nums[i]\n\n   for j in i+1 to len(nums)-1:\n\n       current_sum += nums[j]\n\n       if current_sum >= target:\n\n           length = j - i + 1\n\n           if length < min_length:\n\n               min_length = length\n\n           break  # no need to check further j's for this i\n\nSo, wait: in the code, current_sum starts as nums[i], then for j starting next:\n\ncurrent_sum += nums[j] each time, adding each subsequent element.\n\nWait, wait: no. Because for i=0, j=1: the sum is nums[0] + nums[1].\n\nWhich is correct; that's the contiguous subarray.\n\nYes, but wait, as per the above code, current_sum is initialized to nums[i], and then for j from i+1 to the end, current_sum is added to by nums[j]. So, for j = i+1, it's nums[i] + nums[i+1]; that's two elements. For j = i+2, adding nums[i+2], so sum becomes three elements. Etc.\n\nSo, in this case, for each i and j, the sum is the sum of nums[i] to nums[j], correct.\n\nSo, when current_sum >= target, we calculate the length and break.\n\nBut wait, what is the initial value of current_sum? It's nums[i], and then for each j, we add nums[j]. So for j starting at i+1, the sum is nums[i] plus nums[i+1], in the first step, correct.\n\nWait, wait, no. So:\n\nFor i=0, current_sum starts as nums[0]. Then j starts at i+1=1: current_sum += nums[1]. So the sum is nums[0] + nums[1], correct for the subarray i=0 to j=1.\n\nThen j=2: current_sum += nums[2], sum is nums[0]+nums[1]+nums[2], etc.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nBut wait, suppose we have a two-element subarray. Then for that i, j will be i+1, and current_sum after adding will be the sum of the two elements. If that's >= target, it will record length 2.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly accounts for two-element subarrays, which are the minimal possible.\n\nSo with that, the code should correctly find the minimal length.\n\nWhat about when the minimal is more than two?\n\nLet's see the earlier example: [3,-1,2], target=3.\n\nIn this case, when i=0, current_sum starts as 3. For j=1, current_sum is 3+(-1) =2, which is <3. So we proceed to j=2: current_sum is 2+2=4 which is >=3. So we have a subarray length 3, and since it's the first j, we break. So the minimal length is 3. Correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All elements are negative.\n\nIf the target is, say, -5. And the array is [-3,-2,-1], perhaps.\n\nThen, check all possible subarrays:\n\n[-3,-2] sum is -5: so their sum is equal to target. So length 2.\n\nSo yes, the code would find that.\n\nAnother example:\n\nnums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 15. The entire array sum is 15, but perhaps there's a subarray that's shorter. For i=0, j starts at 1, adding 1+2=3, then 1+2+3=6, 1+2+3+4=10, 1+2+3+4+5=15. So the length is 5, and that's the minimal because the previous accumulations are not enough. So min_length would be 5.\n\nAnother case where no subarrays reach the target: nums = [1,2], target 4. So subarray sum is 3<4, so return 0.\n\nAnother case where the sum is exactly target for a longer subarray but not for a shorter one. For example, nums = [1,1, 3], target 5. Subarray [1,1,3] sum is5. Are there any two-element subarrays sum >=5? 1+3=4 <5, 1+3=4<5. So only in the three-element subarray.\n\nSo the code needs to find that.\n\nWait, let's see. For i=0:\n\nsum = 1 \u2192 then j=1: sum 2 \u2192 then j=2: sum 5 \u22655: length 3.\n\nFor i=1: sum=1, j=2: sum 1 +3=4 <5. So no, so min length is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code would handle all these cases.\n\nNow, what about when the target is negative. Well, as per the problem statement, the target is given as an integer, and sum can be >= target. So for target negative, even a single element is acceptable, but since subarrays must have at least two elements, I think in such a case, any subarray of length 2 or more whose sum meets the target.\n\nWait, for example, target is -10, and the array is [5, -6, 3]. So the sum of [5, -6] is -1 >=-10. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut what if target is -1000 and array is full of negative numbers. Then any subarray would have sum >=-1000.\n\nWait, but in that case, any subarray with two elements would meet the target because their sum is say -3, which is >-1000.\n\nSo the minimal length is 2.\n\nWhich the code will find, because for the first i=0, j=1, the sum is [5-6=-1] which is >=-10.\n\nSo the code would correctly return 2.\n\nThus, the approach seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code will have to loop for each i as a starting point, then for each j beyond i, accumulate the sum, check, etc.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps.\n\nInitialize min_length to a very large value, say, infinity.\n\nn = len(nums)\n\nif n <2, return 0 (since a subarray must have at least 2 elements)\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1-1:\n\n   current_sum = 0\n\n   for j in i to n-1:\n\n      current_sum += nums[j]\n\n      if j ==i: continue  # since we need at least two elements, but in this approach, j starts at i, and for j ==i, it's just 1 element. So not considered.\n\n      if current_sum >= target:\n\n          length = j - i +1\n\n          if length < min_length:\n\n              min_length = length\n\n          break  # no longer j for this i\n\nSo wait, in this approach, the code is:\n\nfor i in 0 to len(nums) -1:\n\n   current_sum = 0\n\n   for j in i, i+1, ..., len(nums)-1:\n\n      current_sum += nums[j]\n\n      if j - i +1 >=2:\n\n          if current_sum >= target:\n\n              record length and break\n\nWait, perhaps the initial j loop can start at 0, but for each i, start j from i and for j up to n-1. Then, only when j >= i+1 do we check if the sum >= target.\n\nSo the code would have:\n\nfor i in range(len(nums)):\n\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n\n        current_sum += nums[j]\n\n        if j > i:  # because j must be at least i+1 for a subarray of size 2\n\n            if current_sum >= target:\n\n                length = j - i +1\n\n                if length < min_length:\n\n                    min_length = length\n\n                break  # move to next i\n\nSo that'd be a better way of writing it. Because for i, j starts from i, adding each next element, and only when j > i (i.e., at least two elements in the subarray) we check the condition.\n\nThis way, for each i, when we find the first j>i where the sum >= target, we can break and take that as the minimal possible for that i.\n\nSo that should handle the case where some j provides a subarray of even longer than 2 elements but only the sum from i to j reaches the target.\n\nTherefore, the code is more efficient.\n\nLet me test this with the earlier example where for target 11, the first subarray found is of length 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for array [10,1], target=11.\n\nIn the code:\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0: current_sum=10 \u2192 since j is not >i (0=0), no check.\n\nj=1: current_sum=11 \u2192 since j>i, check. So length is 2. So min_length is 2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the case where i=0, j moves from i to j, adding elements until the sum is met.\n\nSo this code should correctly handle all cases.\n\nTesting another example:\n\nnums = [1,2,3,4,5], target=15.\n\ni runs 0 to 4.\n\ni=0: j=0: sum=1.\n\nj=1: sum 3 (1+2=3), which is <15.\n\nContinue.\n\nj=2: sum 6 <15.\n\nj=3: sum 10 <15.\n\nj=4: sum 15.\n\nSo j=4, length is 5-0+1=5.\n\nmin_length is 5.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1: sum 2; j starts from 1.\n\nj=1: sum 2. j not > i (since i=1, j=1). so no check.\n\nj=2: sum 2+3=5 <15 \u2192 check no.\n\nj=3: sum 5+4=9 <15 \u2192 check no.\n\nj=4: sum 9+5=14 <15 \u2192 check no.\n\nNo subarray from i=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=2: sum 3. j=3: 3+4=7 <15.\n\nj=4: 7+5=12 <15. So no.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=3: sum4 \u2192 j=4: 4+5=9 <15 \u2192 no.\n\ni=4: j=4\u2192 no sum checked.\n\nThus, minimal is 5.\n\nAnother example: nums = [2, 3, 1, 2], target=6.\n\nEach i:\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0: not checked.\n\nj=1: 2+3=5 <6.\n\nj=2: 5+1=6 \u2192 so length 3. min_length=3.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1: 3 \u2192 no.\n\nj=2: 3+1=4 <6.\n\nj=3: 4+2=6 \u2192 length 3.\n\nSo min_length remains 3.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=2: 1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=3: 1+2=3 <6.\n\ni=3: j=3 \u2192 can't form a subarray of at least two.\n\nThus, min length is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what about a case where multiple i's give j where sum is >=target, but some j are closer than others?\n\nE.g., nums = [5,1,5,5], target=10.\n\ni=0:\n\nj=1: sum 5+1=6 <10.\n\nj=2: 6+5=11\u226510 \u2192 length 3.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the subarrays are:\n\ni=0, j=2 \u2192 sum 5+1+5=11, length 3.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1 \u2192 1 \u2192 j=2: 1+5=6 <10 \u2192 j=3: 6+5=11\u226510 \u2192 length 3.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=2 \u21925 \u2192 j=3:5+5=10 \u226510 \u2192 length 2.\n\nAh, so min_length would be 2.\n\nWait, but in our code, for i=0, first j is 2.\n\nBut then for i=2, j=3 is checked.\n\nSum from i=2 to j=3 is 5+5=10, length 2, which is better.\n\nSo the code would correctly find 2.\n\nSo, the code will, for each i, look for j starting from i+1 each time.\n\nWait, in the code, for i=2, j starts at i=2.\n\nj=2: sum 5 is added to current_sum. Since j=i, no check.\n\nj=3: current_sum +=5, sum is 10. j>i (3>2), so check. sum is 10>=10 \u2192 length 2. So min_length is updated to 2.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother example: nums = [1,1], target = 3. The sum is 2 <3. So code returns 0.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, the code handles all these cases.\n\nSo, the code's logic seems correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, what to initialize min_length as?\n\nWe can set it to a very large value, like infinity.\n\nThen, after processing all i, if min_length is still infinity, return 0, else return min_length.\n\nSo, now let's write the code.\n\nRead nums and target.\n\nn = len(nums)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n   return 0\n\nmin_length = infinity\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   current_sum = 0\n\n   for j in range(i, n):\n\n       current_sum += nums[j]\n\n       if j > i:\n\n           if current_sum >= target:\n\n               length = j - i +1\n\n               if length < min_length:\n\n                   min_length = length\n\n               break\n\nSo after that.\n\nif min_length is still infinity \u2192 return 0 else return min_length.\n\nBut wait, wait, why do I need min_length to be updated only for j>i? Because for j \u2264i, the subarray is too small.\n\nWait, in the code, j runs from i, and the first j is i, but j>i is checked, so the code adds numbers, and for j>=i+1, it's a valid subarray.\n\nWait, for i=0, j starts at 0, which is i, so not checked.\n\nThen j increments to 1: which is j>i (1>0). So in that step, current_sum is nums[0] + nums[1], correct.\n\nYes, but current_sum for j=0 is just nums[0], which is a single element, so not considered.\n\nTherefore, code is correct.\n\nBut what about the case where a two-element subarray in the first i loop?\n\nYes, as in the earlier [10,1] example.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles that.\n\nAnother point: what if for a given i, no j>i gives current_sum >= target? Well, then min_length remains as it is.\n\nSo, after processing all i, if min_length is still infinity, return 0.\n\nSo code can proceed.\n\nNow, time to code.\n\nWait, but let's test the code with an array that has a two-element subarray that meets the target, but also longer ones.\n\nLike: nums = [1,2,3], target =3.\n\nWell, for i=0, j=1: sum 1+2=3 \u2192 length 2.\n\nSo min_length is set to 2.\n\nBut in this case, maybe a longer subarray would also meet the target, like i=0, j=2: 6 >=3, but we break as soon as j=1 found.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nnums = [5, -2, 5, -2, 5], target=7.\n\nPossible subarrays:\n\n5 and -2: sum 3<7.\n\n5, -2,5: 8 \u22657 \u2192 length 3.\n\nBut perhaps looking for a two-element subarray. Like -2 and 5: 3 <7. Or 5 and -2: 3 <7.\n\nWait, not finding any two-element subarray.\n\nWait, for i=2: nums[2] is 5. j=2 is 5, j=3: 5-2=3 <7. j=4: 5-2+5=8\u22657 \u2192 length3.\n\nBut also, for i=4, j=4: subarrays can't be formed.\n\nBut another i like i=0, j=3: sum 5-2+5-2 =6 <7 \u2192 j=4:6+5=11\u22657. So for i=0, j=4, sum 11, which is length5.\n\nThus, the minimal could be 3, from i=0, j=2 (1,0+ 1,1,1,0+1,2: sum 5+ (-2)+5=8, which is \u22657, length3.\n\nBut is there any shorter subarrays, which are three element-length.\n\nWait, another i=2, j=4: sum5+ (-2)+5 =8 \u22657 \u2192 length3.\n\nSo yes, minimal is 3.\n\nSo the code for i=0, j=2 is when the sum becomes 8, which is \u22657, and breaks, setting min_length=3.\n\nThus, it is correct.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute this.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nLet me write this correctly in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef findShortestSubArray(nums, target):\n    n = len(nums)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            current_sum += nums[j]\n            if j > i:\n                if current_sum >= target:\n                    current_length = j - i + 1\n                    if current_length < min_len:\n                        min_len = current_length\n                    break  # no need to check longer j's\n    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0\n\nWait, but wait: in Python, 'float' cannot be compared to int('inf'). But when initializing min_len = float('inf'), in the code.\n\nThus, to return 0 if not found.\n\nTesting this code.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSample Input 1:\nnums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target=7.\n\nWait, I think it's a sample from LeetCode.\n\nWait no, perhaps not. The sample in mind is perhaps Problem 862, which is similar.\n\nSample Input:\nnums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target =7.\n\nIn this case:\n\nPossible subarrays:\n\n2+3=5\u2192 <7; 2+3+1=6 \u2192 <7; 2+3+1+2=8; so i=0, j=3 \u2192 sum 8, length4.\n\ni=1: 3+1=4\u2192 <7; 3+1+2=6\u2192 <7; 3+1+2+4=10\u21927, length4.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nWait the sample input I'm thinking about may have 862 as the problem.\n\nWait, writing another example.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of our own.\n\nAnother example: nums = [1,1,1,1], target=3.\n\nEach two-element subarray sum 2<3.\n\nEach three-element subarray sum 3\u22653, thus length3.\n\nSo code would for each i, find j+2.\n\nLet me see:\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0: 1 \u2192 no.\n\nj=1: sum2 <3 \u2192 continue.\n\nj=2: sum3 >=3 \u2192 length3.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=1\u21921 \u2192 j=2: 1+1=2 <3 \u2192 j=3: 1+1+1=3 \u2192 length3.\n\ni=2: j=2 and j=3: 1+1=2 <3, wait no? Wait.\n\nWait: in i=2: current_sum starts at 0.\n\nWait, no, wait code is:\n\nFor i in range(n):\n\n   current_sum = 0\n\n   for j in range(i, n):\n\n      current_sum += nums[j]\n\n      if j>i:\n\n          if current_sum >= target:\n\n              length = j -i +1.\n\nSo for i=2:\n\nj=2: current_sum +=1 \u2192 j>i? 2>2? No \u2192 no.\n\nj=3: current_sum +=1 \u2192 sum=2. j>i (3>2 \u2192 yes). 2 <3 \u2192 continue.\n\nSo no subarray starting at i=2 with j>=i+1.\n\nThus, the code correctly marks min_len as 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: nums = [4,3,1,3], target = 7.\n\ni=0, j=1: 4+3=7 \u2192 length2.\n\nThus, min_length is 2.\n\nYes, the code would handle it.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nLet me look for possible bugs.\n\nSuppose in the code, the statement 'if j>i' is checked, but let's make sure.\n\nYes: whenever j is greater than i (i.e., j >i \u2192 j >= i+1), then it's a valid subarray with at least two elements.\n\nThus, yes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the shortest contiguous subarray in the given array `nums` such that the sum of its elements is equal to or greater than the target. If no such subarray exists, we return `0`.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a nested loop to check all possible contiguous subarrays starting from each index `i` and extending to each subsequent index `j` (where `j > i`). The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing `min_len` to a very large value (infinity) to keep track of the minimum length of the subarray found.\n\n2. **Iterate through each starting index `i`**: For each starting index `i`, initialize `current_sum` to 0. This sum will accumulate the elements from `i` to `j`.\n\n3. **Expand the subarray**: For each starting index `i`, expand the subarray by moving `j` from `i` to the end of the array. At each step, add the element at index `j` to `current_sum`.\n\n4. **Check the sum**: For each valid subarray (where `j > i`), check if `current_sum` is greater than or equal to the target. If it is, compute the length of the subarray and update `min_len` if this length is smaller than the current `min_len`. Break out of the inner loop immediately to avoid unnecessary checks for longer subarrays starting from the same `i`.\n\n5. **Return the result**: After processing all possible subarrays, if `min_len` remains at infinity, return `0` (indicating no valid subarray was found). Otherwise, return `min_len`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef findShortestSubArray(nums, target):\n    n = len(nums)\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    min_len = float('inf')\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_sum = 0\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            current_sum += nums[j]\n            if j > i:\n                if current_sum >= target:\n                    current_length = j - i + 1\n                    if current_length < min_len:\n                        min_len = current_length\n                    break  # no need to check further for this i\n    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: `min_len` is initialized to infinity to ensure any valid subarray found will be shorter initially.\n- **Outer Loop (i)**: Iterates through each possible starting index of the subarray.\n- **Inner Loop (j)**: For each starting index `i`, this loop expands the subarray to include subsequent elements, accumulating their sum.\n- **Sum Check**: After each expansion, if the sum meets or exceeds the target and the subarray length is valid (at least two elements), update `min_len` if necessary and break out of the inner loop to save time.\n- **Result**: Returns the shortest valid subarray length found; if none found, returns `0`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible subarrays while keeping track of the shortest one that meets the target sum, using a straightforward nested loop structure.",
