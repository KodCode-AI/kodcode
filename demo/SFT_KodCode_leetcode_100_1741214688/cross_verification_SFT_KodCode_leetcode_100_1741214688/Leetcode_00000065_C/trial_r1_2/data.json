  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the missing element in a sorted list of integers. Hmm, so the list is from 1 to n, but one element is missing. My task is to create a function called find_missing_element that takes a list and returns the missing number.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. Like [1,2,4,5,6], the missing is 3. And another example [1], which returns 2. Oh right, because n is 2? Wait, wait, how do I determine n here?\n\nWait, maybe n is the length of the list. Because in the first example, the list has 5 elements, and the numbers go up to 5 but missing one element. Or wait, no, the list is 1 to n where one is missing, but n isn't necessarily the length.\n\nWait, no, maybe the list is from 1 to m where m is the maximum in the list. But no, like in the first test case, the list is [1,2,4,5,6]. The maximum is 6, so m is 6. But the length is 5. So n as the length plus 1? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the sum approach: for a complete list from 1 to n, the sum is n*(n+1)/2. So if we have the list with n-1 elements, then the sum of the given list can be subtracted from the expected sum to get the missing number.\n\nLet me see. For example: [1,2,4,5,6]. The sum of 1+2+4+5+6 is 18. The expected sum if it was 1-6 is 21. So 21-18 is 3, which is the missing number. That works.\n\nAnother example: [1], expected to return 2. So the sum is 1. Expected sum for n=2 is 3. 3-1=2, correct.\n\nBut wait, how do I determine what n is in this approach? Because the list given is missing one element, but the list's length will be n-1, since one is missing. So n is the length of the list plus 1.\n\nWait, for the first example, the list is of length 5, and n should be 6. So the formula would be expected sum is (5+1) * (5+2) /2 ? Wait, wait no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the given list has n-1 elements, because one element is missing. So the array length is len(nums) = m-1, where m is the number in 1..m that is supposed to be present. So m = len(nums) + 1?\n\nWait, perhaps for the list [k], the maximum is k: but depending on what's missing. Like in the test case [2], which returns 1. So when the list is [2], the expected n is 2, since 1 is missing. So the list has 1 element, so m is 2.\n\nSo to find the expected sum, I can take the length of the list, add 1, then m is len(nums)+1. So the expected sum is m*(m+1)/2. Then subtract the sum of the given list.\n\nWait, let's test this. For [1], len(nums) is 1, so m is 2. Expected sum is 3. The sum of the given list is 1. 3-1=2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [2], len is 1. m is 2. Expected sum is 3. Sum of given is 2. 3-2=1, which is correct.\n\nLet me test the case where all elements except one are present beyond 1. Like [1,3,4], which should return 2. Sum of the list is 8. Len is 3, m=4. Expected sum is 4*5/2=10. 10-8=2, correct.\n\nBut wait, in test case len([1,2,3,4,5,6,8]) is 7. So m is 8. Expected sum is 36 (since 8*9/2 is 36). Sum of the given list is 1+2+3+4+5+6+8 = 29. 36-29=7, correct.\n\nSo yeah, the approach is:\n\nCalculate the expected sum as (m)*(m+1)/2, where m is len(nums) +1.\n\nSubtract the sum of the elements in the list.\n\nThe difference is the missing element.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m = len(nums) +1.\n\n2. Compute expected_sum = m * (m + 1) // 2.\n\n3. Compute actual_sum = sum(nums).\n\n4. The missing element is expected_sum - actual_sum.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any case where this approach might fail. Suppose the list is not in order? But the question says it's a sorted list. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when the list is of length 1, as in the given test cases. We've already tested [1] and [2], and they work.\n\nWhat about when the list is missing the last element. Like [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The list is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], so m is 8. Expected sum is 36. Actual sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. 36-28=8, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, according to the test case, the function for [1], the missing is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement this approach.\n\nNow, how to code this in Python.\n\nFunction takes a list as input:\n\ndef find_missing_element(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n\nCompute m = len(nums) +1.\n\nCompute expected_sum = m * (m+1) // 2.\n\nCompute actual_sum = sum(nums).\n\nreturn expected_sum - actual_sum.\n\nThat's it.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,4,5,6] sum is 18. m=6. Expected 21-18=3.\n\nYes.\n\nTest case 2: [1,3,4,5], sum is 13. len is 4, m=5. expected is 15. 15-13=2, correct.\n\nTest case 3: [2], sum is 2, m=2. expected 3, 3-2=1.\n\nAll pass.\n\nEdge case where the list has only 1 element:\n\nLike [1], which returns 2. Correct.\n\nWait another edge case: [n-1], for example [100]. Then m=101? Wait no, no.\n\nWait no, in this case, the list is of numbers from 1 to n, but missing one. So if the list contains 100, n could be higher than 101. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait no, let's see.\n\nWait, no, sorry. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps n is not len(nums) +1, but len(nums) is n, which is 1 to m with one missing, but I need to find the correct m.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the initial reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, if the list is supposed to have all elements from 1 to m except one, then given the list, it must be of size m-1. So m would be len(list) +1.\n\nBut for example, if the list is [3,4,5], then it's missing 1 and 2? But according to the problem statement, the array is sorted and is from 1 to n, missing one element. So perhaps the list is 1 to m, with one element missing, but the list doesn't necessarily have to be in a subset of 1 to m? Or is the list complete except for one?\n\nWait the question says it's a sorted array of integers from 1 to n inclusive. Oh wait, perhaps not from 1 to n. Wait the question says, finds the missing element in a sorted array of integers from 1 to n inclusive.\n\nSo, for example, the array should have all integers from 1 to n, but exactly one is missing.\n\nSo in that case, the list has n-1 elements.\n\nSo, given that, the sum is (n)(n+1)/2 - x, where x is the missing. So x is expected_sum - actual_sum, where expected_sum is n*(n+1)//2 - missing. No, wait wait.\n\nWait, no, expected_sum is n*(n+1)/2, because it's including all numbers from 1 to n. So our approach is correct because when one is missing, the list's length is n-1. So m should be len(nums) +1? Because len(nums) is n-1, m is n.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate m as len(nums) +1, then calculate expected sum, and subtract list's sum.\n\nSo that logic should hold.\n\nAnother example: list [3,4,5] has length 3, so m is 4. Expected sum is 10. 1+2+3+4= 10. Actual sum is 12. 10-12 is negative, which is wrong. Wait, but that list isn't valid because 3,4,5 are higher than 2 elements.\n\nWait, but the list is supposed to be a complete 1 to n with one missing. So a list [3,4,5] is not a valid input to this function.\n\nWait no, perhaps the function is intended to handle only cases where the list is 1 to n, with exactly one missing. So in that case, the list should have length n-1, with n being len+1.\n\nBecause in that case, if the list is [3,4,5], it's length 3, which implies n is 4. But checking 1 to 4 would have 1,2,3,4, but the list has 3,4,5, which makes no sense. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect in that scenario.\n\nSo perhaps, no, I think the function is expected to work under the given problem's constraints, meaning that the input list is indeed a sorted list of consecutive integers from 1 to m, missing one. So, there is no case where the list contains elements beyond m, as in the example I just tried.\n\nSo the approach still holds.\n\nThus, code as planned.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the missing element in a sorted list of integers that range from 1 to n, where exactly one element is missing. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach is based on the mathematical properties of the sum of consecutive integers. Here's the detailed approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The given list contains all integers from 1 to n except one. Therefore, the length of the list is n-1, where n is the largest integer in the range.\n\n2. **Sum of Consecutive Integers**: The sum of the first n integers (from 1 to n) can be calculated using the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). \n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Sum**: Using the formula mentioned above, we calculate the sum that the list would have if all elements from 1 to n were present. Here, n is determined by the length of the given list plus one, i.e., \\( n = \\text{len(nums)} + 1 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Actual Sum**: Compute the sum of the elements in the given list.\n\n5. **Find the Missing Element**: The missing element is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_element(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    m = len(nums) + 1\n    expected_sum = m * (m + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Calculate the Expected Sum**: The expected sum is calculated for a complete range from 1 to m, where m is the length of the given list plus one. This is because if the list has n-1 elements, the complete range would have n elements.\n- **Compute the Actual Sum**: By summing the elements of the given list, we get the actual sum which is less than the expected sum by exactly the missing element.\n- **Determine the Missing Element**: Subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum gives the missing element.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the missing element in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list, making it optimal for this problem.",
