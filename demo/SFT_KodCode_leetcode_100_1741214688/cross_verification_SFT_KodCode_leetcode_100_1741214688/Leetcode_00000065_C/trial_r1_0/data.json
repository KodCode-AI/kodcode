  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the missing element in a sorted array of integers. The array is supposed to contain all the numbers from 1 to n, but one is missing. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, no\u2014the problem says it's a sorted array, so the elements are in order. Oh right, so I can take advantage of that. Since it's sorted, each element should be one more than the previous. So the idea is to find where the gap is. That is, where current element is not equal to the previous plus one.\n\nAlternatively, another approach I remember is that the sum of numbers from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2. But wait, in this case, since the array is of numbers from 1 to m, but missing one, how can I find m?\n\nWait, perhaps m can be found as the length of the array plus one. Because suppose the array should have n elements, but it's missing one, so it has n-1 elements. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says the array is of integers from 1 to n inclusive, but I'm not sure if n is given. Oh wait, no, in the function, the input is a list. So the original array when not missing anything has elements 1,2,...n, so the length is n. But since one is missing, the provided array's length is n-1. But wait, the examples have different lengths. Let's see:\n\nLooking at first example: [1,2,4,5,6] \u2192 which is length 5. The missing is 3. So 5 elements, sum should be 1+2+3+4+5+6 would actually be for n=6. Wait no, the example shows input is [1,2,4,5,6], which has 5 elements, but the numbers go up to 6. So the original array when complete would have 6 elements: 1,2,3,4,5,6. So the sum should be 6*(6+1)/2=21. But the actual sum of the input is 1+2+4+5+6=18. The difference is 3, which is the missing element.\n\nSo in this approach, for a given array, if I calculate what the sum should be if no element was missing, the missing element is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\nBut wait, how do I know what the original n was? Because when the array is missing an element, the length is n-1, but the original n is sort of the maximum number in the array plus one, because in some cases the missing element is not the last one.\n\nWait, for example, [1], the expected would be [1,2], but the array is [1], so the missing is 2. So the maximum in the array is 1, and the expected sum is (1+2) =3. The actual sum is 1, so 2 is missing.\n\nAlternatively, if the array is [2], the expected sum is for n=2 which is 3. Actual sum is 2, so difference is 1.\n\nSo the maximum is either the maximum of the array or as per the expected when n is not present.\n\nHmm, perhaps n is len(nums) +1. Because the array has len(nums) = n-1 elements when one is missing. So the sum should be (n*(n+1))/2 minus (n-1)*(n)/2? Or wait, when the array is missing one element, the sum is (sum 1..n) minus the missing element. So the length of the array is n-1. So n is the length +1.\n\nFor example, in first example, len(nums) is 5. So n should be 6. Then expected sum is 6*7/2=21. The input sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. 21-18=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1] has len 1, so n is 2. Sum should be 3, actual sum is 1, 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [2]. n would be 3 (1+2=3 sum, 2 is len 1+1. Wait, len(nums) is 1, n is 1+1=2? Wait, no: for [2], n should be 2. Because initial array should have 1 and 2. So the maximum in the array is 2, and the sum should be 3. Actual sum is 2, difference is 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps n is len(nums)+1.\n\nYes, since the array is missing one element. So:\n\nn = len(nums) +1\n\nthen, expected_sum = n*(n+1)//2\n\nactual_sum = sum(nums)\n\nmissing = expected_sum - actual_sum\n\nBut wait, let's test another case. What if the array is [1,3,4,5]. Length is 4. So n=4+1=5? That doesn't make sense because the maximum is 5. So the complete array should be [1,2,3,4,5] with sum 15. The actual sum of input is 1+3+4+5=13. 15-13=2, but the missing is 2, which is consistent.\n\nBut wait, the original array is n=5, and the input is of length 4, so n is indeed 4+1=5.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8]. Length is 7. n=7+1=8.\n\nWait, maximum is 8, so yes.\n\nBut wait no: Wait, the array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,8], the missing is 7.\n\nn is 8, len is 7.\n\nThus the method works.\n\nAh, another test case: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10], which has len 9. So n = 10. The sum should be 55, the actual sum is ...1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+10= 46. Difference is 9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], missing 2. So sum of arrays is 1+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 47. The expected sum is n*(n+1)/2 where n is len(nums)+1: len is 8, n=9.\n\nSum 9*10/2=45. But wait, 47 >45, which would give 45-47=-2, which is wrong. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, mistake here.\n\nWait wait wait. Let's think. \n\nIn the test case, the array is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], len is 8.\n\nSo n is len+1=9.\n\nExpected sum is 9*10/2=45.\n\nThe input sum is sum(nums) = 1+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 47.\n\nSo 45-47 is -2. But the missing element is 2, which is 2.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So this method is not giving the correct result for this case.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the calculation.\n\nLet me calculate sum of [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. That is:\n\n1 +3 is 4, plus4 is 8, plus5 is 13, plus6 is 19, plus7 is 26, plus8 is 34, plus9 is 43.\n\nWait, wait, no: Let me add step by step:\n\n1+3 =4, 4+4=8, 8+5=13, 13+6=19, 19+7=26, 26+8=34, 34+9=43.\n\nSo sum is 43. Expected sum is 45. So 45-43=2, which is correct.\n\nOh I must have computed it wrong earlier.\n\nSo when the array is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], sum is 1+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 43.\n\nn = 9 as per len(nums) is 8.\n\nThus, 45-43=2. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother test case: [1]. sum is 1. n = 2. Expected sum is 3. difference is 2. Correct.\n\nIf the array is [2], sum is 2. Expected sum is (2)*(3)/2=3. So 2 - 3 = wait, no! Wait, n is len(nums)+1. len(nums) is 1, so n=2.\n\nThus, expected sum is 3, actual sum is 2, 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nSo all test cases are passing with this approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the length of nums.\n\n2. Compute n = len(nums) +1.\n\n3. Compute the sum of 1 to n: expected_sum = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n4. Compute the actual_sum as sum(nums).\n\n5. The missing element is expected_sum - actual_sum.\n\nSo the code will look like:\n\ndef find_missing_element(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(nums) + 1\n    expected = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual = sum(nums)\n    return expected - actual\n\nBut wait, what about when the array is empty?\n\nLooking at the examples, the constraints don't include empty, but the function as per the problem statement? Probably, in the context of the problem, the array is non-empty. So, no problem.\n\nBut just think: if the array is empty, len is 0. So n=1, expected sum is 1, actual sum 0. So returns 1. Which is correct because it's missing 1.\n\nBut in our case, according to the function and examples, the inputs are always arrays of positive integers with one missing.\n\nThus, this approach looks solid.\n\nSo the code should be as above.\n\nTesting against samples:\n\nSample 1: [1,2,4,5,6]. len=5 \u2192n=6. expected sum 21, actual sum 1+2+4+5+6=18 \u21923. Correct.\n\nSample 2: [1,3,4,5]. len4\u2192n5\u2192sum15. sum is 13 \u2192 2.\n\nSample 3: [2,3,...,6]. n is 6+1=7? Wait wait, no wait: the array is [2,3,4,5,6]?\n\nWait sample 3 input is [2,3,4,5,6].\n\nWait len is 5 \u2192n=6.\n\nsum 2+3+4+5+6= 20.\n\nn=6, sum 6*7/2=21. 21-20=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10].\n\nLen is 9 \u2192 n=10.\n\nSum 1+2+3+4+6+7+8+9+10 = 50.\n\nExpected sum is 10*11/2=55. 55-50=5. Correct.\n\nSo all set.\n\nI think that's the solution. The code is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the missing element in a sorted array of integers that originally contains all integers from 1 to n inclusive, with one integer missing. The solution involves leveraging the properties of the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula \\( \\text{sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). Given the array, which is missing one element, we can determine the missing element by comparing the expected sum of the first n numbers with the actual sum of the elements present in the array.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. Calculate the length of the given array, which is n-1 since one element is missing.\n2. Determine n by adding 1 to the length of the array.\n3. Compute the expected sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n4. Compute the actual sum of the elements in the array.\n5. The missing element is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_element(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(nums) + 1\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Calculate n**: The length of the array is n-1, so n is determined by adding 1 to the length of the array.\n2. **Compute Expected Sum**: Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, the expected sum is \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute Actual Sum**: The sum of the elements in the given array is calculated using Python's built-in `sum()` function.\n4. **Find Missing Element**: The missing element is found by subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the missing element in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array, by utilizing the mathematical properties of the sum of natural numbers.",
