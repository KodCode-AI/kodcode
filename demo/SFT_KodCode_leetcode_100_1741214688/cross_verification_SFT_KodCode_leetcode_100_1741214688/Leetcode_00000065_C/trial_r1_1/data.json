  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have to find the missing element in a sorted array of integers from 1 to n inclusive. Hmm, let's see. So the array is sorted, but there's one number missing, and I need to find which one.\n\nWait, the array is sorted, right? Like the first example is [1, 2, 4,5,6]. So the missing is 3. So one approach is to find the first place where the next number isn't incrementing by 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe the array starts from 1, but sometimes doesn't. Like the test case where the array is [2], and the missing element is 1 because it should be from 1 to 2.\n\nSo maybe I should calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array plus one, since one element is missing. Oh wait! Because the array is supposed to have numbers from 1 to m, but missing one, the length is m-1. Because for example, in [1,2,4,5,6], the length is 5, and m is 6, because numbers are 1-6 but missing one.\n\nSo I think the approach is to find the sum of the array, then subtract it from the expected sum of 1 to m, which would give the missing element.\n\nWait, what's m in this case? Because for a sorted array of nums, the max number would be m, but sometimes the array starts higher. Like in the test case [2,3,4,5,6], the missing is 1, so m is 6, and the sum from 1 to 6 is 21. The array's sum is 2+3+4+5+6 = 20, so the difference is 1.\n\nThat works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the sum of the given array.\n\n2. Compute the expected sum of numbers from 1 to (length of array +1) because the complete array would have n = length +1 elements when missing one.\n\nWait, no. Wait the array is n-1 elements long when missing one. So m, the max number, is length +1? Let's see: for example, in [1,2,4,5,6], the length is 5. The max is 6, which is 5+1. So yes, m is the length of the array +1.\n\nThen, expected_sum = m*(m+1)//2\n\nsum_nums = sum of the array.\n\nmissing = expected_sum - sum_nums.\n\nSo that seems to be a solid plan.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the array doesn't start at 1? Hmm, I think if the array is sorted and contains consecutive numbers except missing one, the method still holds. Because the missing element is somewhere between 1 and m, and the sum will account for it regardless of the starting point.\n\nWait, no. Let's test some scenarios.\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,4,5,6] sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. Expected sum 6*7/2=21. So missing is 3, correct.\n\nTest case 2: [2,3,4,5,6]. Sum is 20. m is 6. expected sum 21, so missing is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,3,4,5]. sum is 13. m is 4+1=5. sum from 1 to5 is 15. 15-13=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [2]. Expected m is 2 (length 1 +1). sum is 3. Sum of array is 2, missing is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1] expects m=2, sum 1+2=3. given array sum 1. So missing is 2. Correct.\n\nSo seems solid.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn the function, take the list nums.\n\nCalculate sum_nums = sum(nums)\n\nm = len(nums) +1\n\nexpected_sum = m*(m+1)//2\n\nmissing = expected_sum - sum_nums\n\nReturn missing.\n\nThat's simple enough.\n\nWait wait, but what if the array is empty? No, according to the problem statement, the array isn't empty since it's given that it's a list of integers containing numbers from 1 to n with exactly one missing. So for example, [1,2,3], the length is 3, m is 4. sum expected is 10. sum provided is 6. missing is 4. So correct.\n\nBut wait, len(nums)+1 could that be the upper bound? For example, when the array is [3,4,5,6], then len is 4, m is5, expected sum is 15, sum of array is 18. Wait 3+4+5+6=18, which is less than 15? No, 3+4+5+6 is 18, 15 is less than 18. So that would result in negative, which is wrong.\n\nWait wait, this indicates a problem. Because in this case, the array would have numbers 3-6, but the function expects them to be 1\u20135 (since 4+1=5). So expecting the sum of 1-5 (15), but the array sum is 3+4+5+6=18. 15-18 is -3, which has to be wrong. But in reality, the array [3,4,5,6] is from 3, but according to the problem statement, the array should be from 1 to n inclusive. So this implies that all the numbers 1 to m must be present except one.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is only applicable when the list is a range from 1 to some m, missing exactly one. So, in the given array, does it always include 1, but that's not possible because sometimes 1 is the missing element.\n\nWait, but in some test cases like [2,3,4,5,6], the sum approach works because 2+3+4+5+6=20, expected sum is 6*7/2=21, so 21-20=1, correct.\n\nBut in the example I made [3,4,5,6], that's incomplete because 1 and 2 are missing, which violates the problem's condition. So perhaps, the problem constraints ensure that the numbers are from 1 up to m except one missing.\n\nSo for this problem, the code will work under the given conditions.\n\nThus, the code written as:\n\nsum_nums = sum(nums)\nm = len(nums) + 1\nexpected = m * (m +1) // 2\nreturn expected - sum_nums\n\nYes, that should do it.\n\nTesting another example from the problem: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8], length 7. M=8. expected sum 8*9//2=36. sum of array is 1+2+3+4+5+6+8=29. 36-29=7, correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] length is 9. m=10. sum is 1+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=53. Expected sum 10*11/2=55. 55-53=2, which is correct.\n\nYes, the approach seems solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the missing element in a sorted array of integers ranging from 1 to n inclusive. The array contains exactly one missing element, and we need to determine which element it is.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The array is sorted and contains all integers from 1 to n except for one. Our task is to identify the missing integer.\n2. **Sum Calculation Insight**: The sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). Here, the value of n should be the length of the array plus one because the array is missing exactly one element.\n3. **Compute Expected Sum**: Using the formula, compute the sum of the first m natural numbers, where m is the length of the array plus one.\n4. **Find Missing Element**: Subtract the sum of the given array from the computed expected sum. The result is the missing element.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it operates in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the array, making it suitable for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_element(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    sum_nums = sum(nums)\n    m = len(nums) + 1\n    expected_sum = m * (m + 1) // 2\n    return expected_sum - sum_nums\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the given array.\n2. **Determine Expected Sum**: The expected sum is calculated based on the length of the array, adjusted for the missing element.\n3. **Find the Missing Element**: By subtracting the actual sum of the array from the expected sum, we determine the missing element.\n\nThis method efficiently leverages arithmetic properties to find the missing element without needing to sort or search the array, ensuring optimal performance.",
