  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the largest palindromic substring that is also lexicographically the largest among all possible ones. Hmm. Let's think about what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The task is to find the largest (longest) such substring. But if there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length, I need to pick the one that is lexicographically largest.\n\nWait, so the first priority is the length\u2014longest possible. Then, for those longest ones, pick the lex largest. Got it.\n\nLet me think about the examples given.\n\nLike, for \"babad\", the palindromic substrings include \"aba\", \"bab\". Both have length 3. Which is larger lex? Let's see, 'bab' is b a b vs 'aba' is a b a. Comparing each character, 'b' is larger than 'a', so 'bab' is lex larger.\n\nBut the first example shows either \"bab\" or \"aba\", but wait, I think according to lex order 'bab' should be returned. Maybe the problem allows either if same, but no\u2014no, because the function's examples suggest that's the case, but if in case of same length and multiple palindromes, we should choose the lex largest.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst thought: Find all possible palindromic substrings, then select the longest ones, and then find the lex largest in that subset.\n\nBut that might not be efficient for long strings, but as per the problem statement, I guess it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, can I optimize it by finding the largest possible palindromes in the string?\n\nHmm, but the string can be up to a certain length, but LeetCode maybe expects an O(n^2) solution or similar.\n\nWait, but the problem is about not only finding the longest palindrome but also the lex largest among them. So, perhaps the standard algorithms for finding the longest palindrome string may not be sufficient, as they may not consider the lexicographic aspect.\n\nSo the approach needs to be: for all possible palindromic substrings, track the longest length, then for all with that length, find the lex largest.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible substrings of s. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome.\n2. Keep track of the maximum length found so far. When a longer palindrome is found, update the maximum and reset the current candidates.\n3. If the same max length is found again, compare lex and update only if current is worse.\n4. Finally, among all candidates of max length, select the lex largest one.\n\nBut checking every substring is O(n^3) time, which might be acceptable for the problem's constraints, but I need to think about it.\n\nWait, what is the time complexity here? For each possible center, expand around it. That's the Manacher's algorithm approach, but maybe that's a way to find all possible palindromic substrings efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible center, find the palindrome, and then track the max length and lex.\n\nBut since the string can be up to, say, 10^3 or something, it's manageable.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nWe can generate all possible palindromic substrings, note their start and end indices, and then among those, find the ones with the maximum length. Then among those, select the one with the highest lex order.\n\nBut to avoid generating all possible substrings, which can be O(n^2) substeps, each with up to O(n) time, perhaps it's more efficient to generate and keep track as we go.\n\nLet's think about a helper function to find palindromes for each center.\n\nFor each character in the string, it can be the center of a palindrome. But also, for even-length palindromes, the center is between two characters.\n\nSo, first, the helper function can expand around each character as the center, treating it as an odd-length palindrome, and then around each pair as the center for even-length palindromes.\n\nEach expansion will give the maximum possible palindrome for that center.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible center, we can find the maximum palindrome expanding from it. Then, for each such palindrome, compare it to the current maximum.\n\nWait, but that might not get all the possible palindromes of maximum length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps partial palindromes are considered, but only the maximum length is relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is to generate all possible palindromic substrings while keeping track of the longest length found. As we do this, for each palindrome we find, we check if it's longer than the current max. If so, we update and reset the candidates. If it's equal in length, compare lex and update if necessary.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I'll need to write a function that, for a given string, finds all possible palindromic substrings.\n\nWait, but we can do this without generating all, because for a given center, the maximum possible palindrome for that center is known.\n\nSo for each center, we can find all possible palindromes that expand from it. Each expansion is a potential palindrome, but as we're looking for the longest, maybe in practice, the largest one for each center is the best.\n\nAlternatively, in this case, perhaps for each possible substring, we can check whether it's a palindrome.\n\nBut that's O(n^3) time, which for n=1000 is 1e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but in practice, perhaps for the problem's test cases, it's manageable. Alternatively, think of a more efficient way.\n\nWait, another idea: for palindromic substrings, their length can vary, so perhaps we can iterate from the maximum possible length down to 1. For each possible length l (starting from n down to 1), check all possible substrings of length l. For each substring of length l, check if it's a palindrome. If any are found, among these, collect all and then select the lex largest.\n\nOnce we find palindromic substrings of length l, we can immediately process them, since larger len can't exist (as we are starting from the maximum possible). So, the first time we find palindromic substrings, for a particular l, those sub-strings are the candidates, and then within that l, pick the lex largest.\n\nThis approach's time varies based on the string, but if the string is all 'a's, the code finds the entire string first.\n\nSo in the worst case, for a string of length n, how many substrings do we process?\n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... up to 1. So O(n^2) operations.\n\nBut for each substring of length l, when l is around n/2, the number of substrings is n*(l) times, but wait, no. Each substring is of length l, so the number is (n - l + 1) for each l.\n\nSo for the O(n^2) substrings, and for each, whether it's a palindrome can be checked quickly.\n\nBut the standard way to check if a substring is a palindrome is O(l) time. So the total time is O(n^3), which is again not feasible for large n.\n\nThus, this approach isn't efficient enough.\n\nSo, what's the alternative?\n\nHmm, maybe using the expand around the center technique, but each expansion can be done in O(1) time, giving an O(n^2) solution.\n\nBut the problem is not only to find the longest palindrome but also the lex order when there's a tie in length.\n\nWait, so perhaps in addition to finding the longest palindrome, I need to track all palindromes of maximum length and then select the lex largest among them.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: Starting with the entire string, check if it's a palindrome. If yes, return it.\n\nIf not, then check all substrings of length n-1, in both directions. For each substring of length n-1, check if it's a palindrome.\n\nWait, that might not be efficient, but perhaps more optimized.\n\nBut how to manage, for each possible length l, collect all substrings of that length that are palindromes, then for the largest l, find the maximum in lex order.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Iterate l from n down to 1:\n\n   a. For each i from 0 to n-l:\n\n      i. get substring s[i:i+l]\n\n      ii. if it's a palindrome, compare to the current max:\n\n         - if l > current_max_length, update current_max_length and set current_max_palindromes to [s[i:i+l]]\n\n         - elif l == current_max_length, add to current_max_palindromes\n\n   b. After processing each l, if current_max_palindromes is not empty, process the candidates.\n\n      Break the loop since we found the maximum l.\n\n2. Once current_max_palindromes is collected as all palindromic substrings of length l, select the lex largest one.\n\nNow, for each l, the total substrings processed are O(n). For each, checking if it's a palindrome is O(l), which leads to O(n^3) time for the worst case.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to check each substring for being a palindrome in O(1) time, using pre-processing.\n\nYes! The Manacher's algorithm or using dynamic programming to precompute which substrings are palindromic.\n\nAlternatively, precompute a DP table where dp[i][j] is True if s[i..j] is a palindrome, else False.\n\nThis can be done in O(n^2) time and space, which for n up to 1000 is manageable.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n1. Precompute the DP table for all substrings being palindromic.\n\n2. Iterate l from n down to 1:\n\n   a. For all i in 0 to n-l:\n\n      i. j = i + l -1.\n\n      ii. if dp[i][j] is True, add s[i:j+1] to current list for this l.\n\n   b. If any substring of this length is found to be palindromic, set the max_length to l, collect all such substrings in a list, then break the l loop.\n\n3. Once the list of all palindromes of max_length is obtained, select the lex largest one among them.\n\nNow, the precomputing step is O(n^2), which is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the DP table.\n\nInitialize dp[i][i] = True for all i (single characters are palindromes).\n\nAlso, dp[i][i+1] = (s[i] == s[i+1]).\n\nThen for substrings of length >=3, dp[i][j] is True if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1] is True.\n\nThis is fill correctly as substrings are considered from smaller to larger.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps.\n\nImplement DP table construction.\n\nThen, for each possible length, collect all palindromic substrings.\n\nOnce the max_length palindromes are found, pick the lex largest.\n\nWait, but for each i and j, substring from i to j (inclusive), then check if dp[i][j] is True.\n\nThen for each l starting from n down:\n\n   For i in 0 to (n-l) inclusive:\n\n      j = i + l -1.\n\n      if i + l -1 < n:\n\n          check dp[i][j]\n\n          if yes, add s[i:j+1] to list.\n\nNow, once any such substrings are found for a given l, as l decreases, the current list will collect the max_length ones.\n\nWait, no. Because we're starting with large l, so the first time we find any palindromic substrings for a certain l, that's the maximum possible, and we can stop.\n\nWait, right! Because we're starting l from n down to 1, so the first l for which at least one substring of length l is palindromic is the maximum possible. So, once we find, say, that for l = 5, there exists a substring, then any longer l's (like 6,7, etc.) don't exist because we start from the top.\n\nWait, suppose that the entire string is length 5, and in the first iteration l =5, we check if the entire string is a palindrome. If yes, that's the max. Otherwise, proceed to l=4.\n\nWait, but for each l, the loop starts from l = n down to 1.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nmax_candidates = []\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    candidates = []\n\n    for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n        j = i + l - 1\n\n        if dp[i][j]:\n\n            candidates.append(s[i:j+1])\n\n    if candidates:\n\n        max_length = l\n\n        max_candidates = candidates\n\n        break\n\nWait, no, because for l= max_length, we collect all possible palindromic substrings of that length. Once we collect them, we don't have to check smaller l anymore because max_length cannot be larger.\n\nNo, the code above actually only takes the first l that has palindromes. But there could be longer palindromes elsewhere.\n\nWait, no. Because l starts from n down. So the first l for which any palindrome exists is the maximum possible, so there's no longer.\n\nWait, for example, in the string 'abba', length 4, l starts at 4. The function has s[0:4], which is 'abba' (a palindrome). So the candidates include 'abba', then the function breaks after l=4, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'abcda'\u2014the longest palindromic substring is 'a' or 'b' or 'c' or 'd', each of length 1. So for l=5, s[0:5] is 'abcda' \u2192 is dp[0][4] True? Only if it's a palindrome. 'abcda' is not a palindrome because first 'a' and last 'a' are same, but in the middle, other letters must mirror. So for l=5, no; then l=4: check substrings of length 4, etc.\n\nSo, the code would process l from 5 down to 1 until it finds a palindromic substring of that length. Once found, it captures all of them in 'candidates', and since it's the longest possible, we can stop checking smaller l.\n\nWait, but that's a mistake.\n\nBecause, suppose that for l=4, there are some palindromic substrings, but for l=3, there are longer ones.\n\nNo, l reduces as we go. For example, in 'aabcdcbax', imagine that the maximum possible palindrome is of length 5, but it's only present for l=5 in certain i. But then, perhaps for l=5, a longer substring exists, but our code would not capture that.\n\nWait, perhaps not\u2014maybe not. Because for l=5, it's a palindrome of length 5. For l=6, if any exists, they would be longer.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each l, it starts with n. Once any for l is processed and found, the code breaks, and ignores any larger l's.\n\nWait, no, because the loop starts with l from high to low. So for each l, if any palindrome exists, it captures those, and since the next l's are smaller, the code can't capture a longer palindrome.\n\nWait, no. Because the first l that is processed is for the maximum possible, which is n. So if any substring of length n is a palindrome, it's the maximum.\n\nSimilarly, for l = n-1, if a palindrome of length n-1 exists, that's the maximum.\n\nSo, the code is correct in breaking at the first l where any palindromic substring is found, but that requires that l is processed in the order of largest to smallest.\n\nThus, if for l1, there are no palindromic substrings, the code proceeds to l1-1, and so on.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because l is starting from n down to 1.\n\nBut wait, after each l iteration, it's checked if any candidates are found. If yes, then the code proceeds to process and collect those candidates of that l as the maximum. Because any longer palindromes would have to have a larger l.\n\nThus, the code is correct in earlier l checks.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because some longer palindromes may be found for larger l. So l starts at n: if the entire string is a palindrome, that's the maximum. Otherwise, l decreases to n-1, and the code looks for the next.\n\nThus, the code will correctly find the maximum length.\n\nSo, after the DP table is setup, the code can process l from n down, checking all possible substrings of that length for being a palindrome. Once found, collect and break.\n\nThis approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next part is to select the lex largest among those candidates.\n\nSo, for the list 'max_candidates', which contains all substrings of length max_length that are palindromes, I have to find the lexicographically largest one.\n\nHow to do that.\n\nIn Python, the lex order can be determined by string comparison. Since all these are of the same length, comparing them directly would yield the lex order.\n\nThus, in code, after collecting all max_candidates, I can do max(candidates, key=lambda x: x) to get the lex largest.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input where the candidates are ['a','c'], the lex larger is 'c', which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the DP table.\n\nImplementing it:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp with size n x n, where dp[i][j] is True if the substring s[i...j] is a palindrome.\n\nFor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   dp[i][i] = True\n\nFor pairs where j = i+1 (substrings of length 2):\n\n   dp[i][i+1] = (s[i] == s[i+1])\n\nThen, for lengths from 3 to n:\n\n   for length in 3 to n:\n\n      for i in 0 to n - length:\n\n          j = i + length -1\n\n          if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1]:\n\n              dp[i][j] = True\n\nThus, for all lengths, the table is filled correctly.\n\nIn Python, for a given string s, n = len(s).\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nCompute dp.\n\nIterate l from n down to 1.\n\nFor each l, create a list of all substrings of that length that are palindromes (using the dp table).\n\nIf any found, set the list as current candidates for max length and break the loop.\n\nTake the maximum string from the candidates.\n\nFinally, return that maximum string.\n\nBut now, let's test this approach against the sample.\n\nSample 1: \"babad\"\n\nn=5.\n\nThe possible palindromic substrings of length 3: 'aba', 'bab'; 'aba' is s[0:2], 'bab' is s[1:4], 'aba' s[2:4]?\n\nWait, need to compute the dp.\n\nWait, for substring of length 3:\n\ns = 'babad'\n\nIndices 1 to 3: s[1]=a, s[2]=b, s[3]=a \u2192 is it a palindrome? Let's see, a b a: yes.\n\nIndices 0-2: 'bab' \u2192 which is a palindrome.\n\nWait, so for l=3, two substrings: 'bab' and 'aba' and 'aba' (maybe, depending on the dp.\n\nWait, for i=0, l=3:\n\nj=0+3-1=2: s[0:3] is 'bab' \u2192 which is a palindrome.\n\nSo yes, dp[0][2] is True.\n\nAlso, for i=1, l=3: s[1:4] (since j is 1+3-1=3) is 'aba' \u2192 which is a palindrome.\n\nFor i=2, j=4 is 2+3-1=4, s[2:5] is 'bad', which isn't a palindrome.\n\nSo, the candidates for l=3 are 'bab' and 'aba'.\n\nThe lex largest is 'bab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's logic for this sample would correctly handle it.\n\nAnother sample: 'racecar' \u2192 the entire string is a palindrome of length 7, so it would be found when l=7, candidates = ['racecar'], which is the only one. So return it.\n\nAnother sample: 'a' \u2192 returns 'a'.\n\nSample 'ac' \u2192 the candidates of l=1 are ['a', 'c'], [Wait how?]\n\nWait, for l=2, s[0:1] is 'ac' \u2192 is it a palindrome? 'a' vs 'c' \u2192 no.\n\nSo it processes l=2, finds nothing. Then l=1: any single character is a palindrome. So the code returns the lex largest substring of length 1. Which is 'c'.\n\nWhich matches the sample, where either 'a' or 'c' can be returned, but in the function's sample, for 'ac', either is acceptable, but presumably the code would return 'c'.\n\nHmm, actually, because 'c' is lex larger than 'a'.\n\nWait, so when l=1, 'a' is the substring at i=0, 'c' is at i=1.\n\nSo the candidates list for l=1 is ['a', 'c'] \u2192 the maximum is 'c', which is correctly returned.\n\nAll right, seems solid.\n\nAnother sample: 'cbbd' \u2192 the candidates for l=2 are 'bb' (i=1, j=2), 'bb' is a palindrome.\n\nSo the code will process l=4: is 'cbbd' a palindrome? 'c' vs 'd' \u2192 no.\n\nl=3: check substrings of length 3: 'cbb', 'bbd'. 'cbb' is not a palindrome (c != b). 'bbd' is not a palindrome.\n\nl=2: check 'cb' (no), 'bb' (yes), 'bd' (no).\n\nSo candidates for l=2 are ['bb'] \u2192 so return 'bb'.\n\nWhich is correct per the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'banana' \u2192 the maximum palindrome length is 5, 'anana' (s[1:5+1] or as 1-5?), let's see.\n\n'banana' is indices 0-based.\n\nThe substrings of length 6: no.\n\nLength 5: does 'banana' have length 5 substrings that are palindromes?\n\nLooking for 0 to 4: s[0:5] is 'banan' \u2192 index 0= b, 4= n. Not a palindrome.\n\nWait, maybe wait, s[1:6] is 'anana' which is a palindrome.\n\nBecause:\n\ns[1] = 'a'\n\ns[6-1-1+1]= s[5] = 'a' ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see for 'anana' \u2192 yes, it is a palindrome.\n\nWait, in code:\n\ns = 'banana' \u2192 indices 0: 'b', 1:'a', 2:'n', 3:'a',4:'n',5:'a'\n\nSo for substring from i=1, length 5.\n\nj=1+5-1=5: substring is s[1:6], which is 'anana'.\n\nWait, s[1] is 'a', s[5] is 'a'. Then s[2] and s[4]: 'n' and 'n' \u2192 same. The middle is s[3] is 'a'.\n\nThis is a palindrome.\n\nIn the dp table, dp[1][5] should be True.\n\nSo during l=5 processing:\n\ni can be 0 \u2192 j=4: is s[0:5] a palindrome? 'banan' \u2192 'b' vs 'n' \u2192 no.\n\ni=1: s[1:6] is 'anana' \u2192 which is a palindrome.\n\nThus, for l=5, the candidate list is ['anana']. So it's selected, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach should handle that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing that.\n\nFirst, precompute dp.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n ==0, return ''\n\nCompute a 2D dp array.\n\nThen, for each l from n down to 1:\n\n   for i in 0 to n-l:\n\n      j = i + l -1.\n\n      if dp[i][j]:\n\n          add s[i:j+1] to current list.\n\n   if current list is not empty: set as max and break.\n\nThen, find the max among max_candidates.\n\nBut how to handle when l=1, all characters are added.\n\nWait, in Python code.\n\nBut how to compute the dp.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- n=1: returns s[0]\n\n- s has all non-palindromic except for length 1.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nImplement:\n\ndef find_largest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        return ''\n\n    # Create a DP table\n    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Initialize all single characters as palindromes\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = True\n\n    # Check for two-letter palindromes\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n            dp[i][i+1] = True\n\n    # Fill the DP table for lengths >=3\n    for length in range(3, n+1):\n        for i in range(n - length +1):\n            j = i + length -1\n            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = True\n\n    # Now find the longest palindromic substring(s)\n    max_length = 0\n    max_candidates = []\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n            j = i + l -1\n            if dp[i][j]:\n                candidate = s[i:j+1]\n                if l > max_length:\n                    max_length = l\n                    max_candidates = [candidate]\n                elif l == max_length:\n                    max_candidates.append(candidate)\n        if max_length == l:\n            break\n\n    # Now find the lex largest among max_candidates\n    if not max_candidates:\n        return ''\n\n    return max(max_candidates, key=lambda x: x)\nWait, but initially, max_length is 0. So when l decreases and it finds the first matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should set max_length initially to 0, and then for each l, check if l is larger than current max_length. If yes, reset the list. If not, just add if it's equal.\n\nBut looking at the code, for each l, during the iteration for l from high to low. For each i in that l, check if the substring is palindrome.\n\nif current_max_length is 0 (initial), then any l for which l>0 will be larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is slightly incorrect in that part.\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor example, in 'a', l runs from 1 down to 1.\n\nDuring l=1, i runs from 0 to 0, j=0, dp[0][0] is True, so max_length becomes 1.\n\nmax_candidates is ['a'].\n\nThus, the code is okay.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' \u2192 l starts with 4: s[0:4] is 'abba', which is a palindrome. So in the first iteration of l=4, the code sets max_length to4, candidates = ['abba'], and then returns it after.\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, another case: 'ab'.\n\nIn this case, when l=2, the code checks i=0: 'ab' is s[0:2]. But since a!=b, dp[0][1] is False. So no candidates are found for l=2.\n\nThen, code proceeds to l=1: for i=0, dp[0][0] is True: substring 'a' is in the cand list. Similarly, for i=1, substring 'b' is added.\n\nThus, the max_candidates for l=1 is ['a','b'], since neither l=2 has any. The code then returns 'b' as the lex largest, which is correct.\n\nYes, that's as per the sample.\n\nNow, what about if no palindromes have length >=2: for example, s = 'abcdcba'?\n\nWait sorry, 'abcdcba' is a palindrome, but no\u2014the entire string is length 7. So during l=7, it's checked as a palindrome, so it returns the entire string.\n\nBut for 'abcd' the function should return 'a' but no\u2014wait no, the function returns the lex largest of all single character palindromes.\n\nWait, for 'abcd', the code will process l=4: no palindromes.\n\nl=3: all substrings of len 3: 'abc', 'bcd'. Check if they are palindromes: only 'abc' is 'a' 'b' 'c' \u2192 no. So, no.\n\nl=2: same, none.\n\nl=1: all four single characters: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'.\n\nThe lex largest is 'd', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the approach should now be represented by the above code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the largest (longest) palindromic substring in a given string. If there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length, we need to return the lexicographically largest one.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using dynamic programming to efficiently determine all possible palindromic substrings and then selecting the longest and lexicographically largest one.\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction**:\n   - We construct a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:]` to `s[j]` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.\n   - Single characters are palindromes by definition, so `dp[i][i] = True` for all `i`.\n   - For two-character substrings, `dp[i][i+1]` is `True` if the two characters are the same.\n   - For substrings of length 3 or more, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the characters at the ends are the same and the substring between them is also a palindrome.\n\n2. **Finding the Longest Palindromic Substring**:\n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the longest (the entire string) down to the shortest (individual characters).\n   - For each length, check all possible substrings of that length using the precomputed `dp` table.\n   - Keep track of the longest palindromic substrings found.\n\n3. **Selecting the Lexicographically Largest**:\n   - Among all palindromic substrings of the maximum length found, return the lexicographically largest one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_largest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Create a DP table\n    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize all single characters as palindromes\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = True\n    \n    # Check for two-letter palindromes\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            dp[i][i + 1] = True\n    \n    # Fill the DP table for lengths >= 3\n    for length in range(3, n + 1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = True\n    \n    max_length = 0\n    max_candidates = []\n    \n    # Iterate from the longest possible substring to the shortest\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n            j = i + l - 1\n            if dp[i][j]:\n                candidate = s[i:j+1]\n                if l > max_length:\n                    max_length = l\n                    max_candidates = [candidate]\n                elif l == max_length:\n                    max_candidates.append(candidate)\n        # Early exit as soon as the longest possible substring is found\n        if max_length == l:\n            break\n    \n    if not max_candidates:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Return the lexicographically largest substring among candidates\n    return max(max_candidates, key=lambda x: x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:\n   - The table `dp` is filled such that `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring from `i` to `j` is a palindrome.\n   - This is done in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest substrings and building up to larger ones.\n\n2. **Finding the Longest Palindrome**:\n   - By iterating from the longest possible substring down to the shortest, we ensure that the first set of palindromic substrings found are the longest possible.\n   - Each substring is checked using the precomputed `dp` table, ensuring efficient palindrome verification.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**:\n   - Once the longest palindromic substrings are identified, the lexicographically largest one is selected using a simple maximization based on string comparison.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines dynamic programming with careful iteration to solve the problem in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.",
