  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the largest palindromic substring, and if there are multiple with the same length, pick the lexicographically largest one. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a palindrome? A string that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for example, \"abba\" or \"racecar\". The problem is to find the largest such substring in the given string s. If there are multiple palindromes of the maximum length, I need to choose the one that comes first lex-wise, I think. Wait, no, in the examples it looks like when two have the same length, like in \"babad\", both \"bab\" and \"aba\" are palindromic and the max length is 3, and either is acceptable. So perhaps the function returns one of them, but in the code, it needs to choose the lex largest.\n\nSo the steps are: find all palindromic substrings, keep track of the maximum length found, among those, find the lex largest.\n\nBut how do I efficiently generate all possible palindromic substrings and track the maximum? A brute force approach could consider every possible substring, check if it's a palindrome, and then keep the largest ones. But for long strings, that's O(n^3) which is not efficient. So I need a better approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the string is not too long, and brute force could work. But considering that the function needs to return a substring, perhaps it's manageable. Let me think about the possible inputs. Since lower case letters are allowed, but the size is not specified, it's better to think of an efficient approach.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the lex largest. So, the lex order is based on the alphabetical order. So for two palindromes of the same length, the one with higher characters comes first. For example, between \"aba\" and \"bab\", \"bab\" is lex larger because 'b' comes after 'a'. So, perhaps when multiple palindromes of maximum length exist, the one with the highest starting character is selected, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for same-length palindromes, we compare them lex-wise like normal strings, taking the one that comes later in dictionary order. So for \"apple\", the palindromes could be \"a\", \"p\", \"elpple\" (no, wait no, \"elpple\" isn't a palindrome). Hmm.\n\nSo, to find the lex largest, if two palindromes have the same maximum length, I need to find which is larger when comparing their strings as per lex order.\n\nSo, the goal is to:\n\n1. Find the longest possible palindrome in s.\n\n2. If there are multiple palindromes of that length, select the lex largest among them.\n\nSo, how can I find the longest palindromic substrings?\n\nOne approach is to expand around each possible center, which can handle both even and odd length palindromes.\n\nWait, the expand around center method. So for each character, consider it as the center and expand to both sides as long as the left and right sides match. Then it can find the maximum palindrome around that center. Doing this for every possible center will give the maximum possible palindromes. From there, I can track the maximum length and the corresponding substrings.\n\nBut since I need to choose the lex largest among palindromes of the same maximum length, perhaps after finding all of them, I can select the one with the highest lex order.\n\nBut wait, considering the case where a longer palindrome starts with a higher character\u2014so even if we have two palindromes, the longer one is automatically preferred. So if a 5-length and a 4-length, the 5 is longer, so we don't need to care about the lex order between their contents. So the process is:\n\n- Find the maximum length palindrome(s).\n\n- Among them, choose the lex max.\n\nSo the first step is to find all possible palindromes, track the maximum length, collect all palindromes of that maximum length, then pick the lex largest one.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through each position in the string, treating it as the center.\n\n- For each center, expand as far as possible to get the largest palindrome around it.\n\n- Keep track of the maximum length found so far.\n\n- For all palindromes of maximum length, collect them and then select the lex max.\n\nAlternatively, during the expansion, when a new palindrome of same maximum length is found that is lex larger than the current, update the result.\n\nBut to make the selection easier, perhaps it's better to collect all possible palindromes and then process them.\n\nWait, but if the string is very long, this approach could be O(n^2) in time for the expand around center, which is better than O(n^3).\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact time complexities, but I'd proceed.\n\nSo, let's think about the expand around center approach for both even and odd length palindromes.\n\nFor each index i, consider it as the center for odd-length palindromes, expanding as long as left and right are equal.\n\nSimilarly, for even-length, consider i and i+1 as centers, and expand.\n\nWait, no. The standard approach is to loop through each character, and then consider both cases: odd length (centered at i) and even length (centered between i and i+1).\n\nSo for each i from 0 to len(s)-1:\n\n   handle odd-length: expand i as center, step on both sides.\n\n   handle even-length: expand with i and i+1 as centers if s[i] == s[i+1].\n\nFor each expansion, when the palindrome is found, we calculate its start and end indices.\n\nWe then see if the length is greater than the current maximum.\n\nIf it is, we update the max length and reset the list of palindromes of this new max.\n\nIf it's equal to the max but not greater, we add this to our list.\n\nOnce all palindromes are considered, we then sort the list of maximum length palindromes lex-wise and pick the largest.\n\nBut wait, that's not efficient. Instead of collecting all, perhaps while expanding, we can track the maximum, and when a new one of the same length is found, compare lex and update if larger.\n\nSo, let's have variables:\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nresult = \"\"\n\nThen, for each palindrome found:\n\ncurrent_length = right - left + 1\n\nif current_length > max_length:\n\n   update max_length and set result to s[left:right+1]\n\nelif current_length == max_length:\n\n   current_pal = s[left:right+1]\n\n   if current_pal > result:\n\n       result = current_pal\n\nThis way, we can process each palindrome as we find them.\n\nThis way, after all expansions, the result would be the longest and lexicographically largest palindrome.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, because for a given length, palindromes could come from different expansion points. For example, in \"babad\", the palindromes of length 3 are \"bab\" and \"aba\". When processing, whichever comes first and is lex larger will be chosen.\n\nBut in the loop, the code would process \"a\" at index 0, then \"b\" at 1, which would yield \"bab\" when expanded, which is length 3. Then, processing the a at index 2, the expansion yields \"aba\" which is also length 3. Since it's lex order is 'a' vs 'b', the current result is 'bab' so the second would be 'aba', but 'bab' comes first and is larger. So, in this case, the code would correctly keep 'bab' as the result, and the else clause would not update it because 'aba' is smaller than 'bab'.\n\nSimilarly, when processing the first 'b' in \"cbbd\", the expansion would yield 'bb', which is the maximum length 2. And the last 'd' is single letter, so the result is 'bb', which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"ac\" \u2014 the palindromes are 'a' and 'c'. Both are length 1. So the loop would process 'a' first, result is 'a'. Then, when processing 'c', it would see a same-length palindrome, but 'c' is lex larger than 'a', so it would update the result to 'c'.\n\nYes, that would adhere to the test case where both 'a' or 'c' can be returned.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each possible center, expand the palindrome.\n\nCompute the substring, its length.\n\nCompare with max_length. If longer, update.\n\nIf same length, check lex order: if current_pal is larger, update result.\n\nSo, that'd get the desired result.\n\nSo the next step is to implement that.\n\nBut how to loop through each center and expand?\n\nI can write two helper functions: one for expanding from a single center (odd length), and another for expanding from a dual center (for even length).\n\nAlternatively, in the same loop, handle both cases.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInitialize max_length as 0, result as empty string.\n\nFor i in 0 to len(s)-1:\n\n   len1 = expand(s, i, i)  # for odd length\n\n   len2 = expand(s, i, i+1)  # for even length\n\nBut wait, actually, the expand function could return the start and end indices of the palindrome.\n\nWait, perhaps more efficient to have the expand function return (start, end).\n\nBut perhaps in code:\n\nWrite a helper function that takes left, right pointers.\n\ndef expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n\n    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n\n        left -= 1\n\n        right += 1\n\n    return (left + 1, right - 1)\n\nWait, when s[left] != s[right], the loop stops.\n\nThen the palindrome is from left+1 to right-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the length is (right-1 - (left+1) + 1) = right - left -1.\n\nSo in the main function:\n\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n\n    # odd length\n\n    left, right = i, i\n\n    l1 = expand_around_center(s, left, right)\n\n    start_odd = l1[0]\n\n    end_odd = l1[1]\n\n    current_pal = s[start_odd:end_odd+1]\n\n    current_len = end_odd - start_odd +1\n\n    if current_len > max_length:\n\n        max_length = current_len\n\n        result = current_pal\n\n    elif current_len == max_length:\n\n        if current_pal > result:\n\n            result = current_pal\n\n    # even length\n\n    left, right = i, i+1\n\n    l2 = expand_around_center(s, left, right)\n\n    if l2[1] < len(s):\n\n        start_even = l2[0]\n\n        end_even = l2[1]\n\n        current_pal = s[start_even:end_even+1]\n\n        current_len = end_even - start_even +1\n\n        if current_len > max_length:\n\n            max_length = current_len\n\n            result = current_pal\n\n        elif current_len == max_length:\n\n            if current_pal > result:\n\n                result = current_pal\n\nWait, but in some cases, when the even expansion is beyond the string length, like for i = len(s)-1, right = i+1 is len(s), which is invalid. So in the expand around center function, the loop will not execute because the condition right < len(s) would be false.\n\nSo, in that case, the function returns (len(s)-1, len(s)-1), right? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf left is i= len(s)-1, right is len(s)-1 +1 = len(s), which is beyond, so in the while loop, right < len(s) is False. So the while loop doesn't run, and the function returns (left +1, right-1) which for i= len(s)-1 is (i+1, len(s)-1 ). Wait, wait:\n\nWait, initially, left = i, right = i+1.\n\nThen, in the expand function, while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right], increment.\n\nIf i is len(s)-1, then right = i+1 is len(s), so right < len(s) is false. So the function doesn't loop, returns (i+1, right-1) which is (len(s), len(s)-1), but that seems off.\n\nWait, because the initial left and right are i and i+1.\n\nWait, but in this case, function returns (i+1, i) for the even case, since right is i+1.\n\nSo for len(s) is currently 5, say i=4. Then, right =5, which is >= len(s).\n\nSo left is 4, which is >=0.\n\nBut right is 5, which is not < len(s) (since len(s)=5). So the condition fails.\n\nSo the function returns (4+1, 5-1) \u2192 (5,4), which is invalid.\n\nBut wait, s[left...right] would be from 5 to 4, which is invalid.\n\nBut in the code, when we compute the substring, it's s[start_even:end_even+1], which with start_even=5 and end_even=4 would result in s[5:4+1] \u2192 s[5:5], which is an empty string. Hmm, but that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the expand_around_center function needs to take left and right, which must be valid indices initially. So for the even case, i and i+1 must be within the string.\n\nWait, but in code:\n\nfor i in 0 to len(s)-1:\n\n   handle even case, where right is i+1. But i must be less than len(s)-1.\n\nSo perhaps in the loop for i in range(len(s) - 1), so that for even, i+1 is within the string. Or add a condition.\n\nAlternatively, in the main loop:\n\nhandle odd cases for all i.\n\nThen, for even cases, loop i from 0 to len(s)-2.\n\nAh, yes, that's better.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n\n   handle odd case.\n\nfor i in range(len(s)-1):\n\n   handle even case.\n\nWait, but I can't handle them separately in two loops, because that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, in the main loop, for each i:\n\nhandle the odd case.\n\nthen handle the even case only if i < len(s)-1:\n\nso in code:\n\nfor i in range(len(s)):\n\n   # odd case\n\n   left, right = i, i\n\n   [\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 do expansion \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7]\n\n   if i < len(s)-1:\n\n      # even case\n\n      left, right = i, i+1\n\n      [\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 expansion and check \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7]\n\nWait, that's manageable.\n\nSo, in code, I'll write:\n\nInitialize result as the first character, since every single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n\nmax_length = 1\n\nresult = s[0]\n\nThen, for each i in range(len(s)):\n\n   handle odd case:\n\n      left, right = i, i\n\n      start, end = expand_around_center(s, left, right)\n\n      current_len = end - start + 1\n\n      if current_len ==0:  # can this happen? Probably not, but need to think.\n\n         continue.\n\n      current_pal = s[start:end+1]\n\n      if current_len > max_length:\n\n          max_length = current_len\n\n          result = current_pal\n\n      elif current_len == max_length:\n\n          if current_pal > result:\n\n              result = current_pal\n\n   if i < len(s) -1:\n\n      # even case\n\n      left, right = i, i+1\n\n      start_e, end_e = expand_around_center(s, left, right)\n\n      # but since initial left and right may be same or not.\n\n      # so for even, for initial left=i, right=i+1, if s[i] == s[i+1], then can expand.\n\n      current_len_e = end_e - start_e +1\n\n      if current_len_e > 0:\n\n          current_pal_e = s[start_e : end_e +1]\n\n          if current_len_e > max_length:\n\n              max_length = current_len_e\n\n              result = current_pal_e\n\n          elif current_len_e == max_length:\n\n              if current_pal_e > result:\n\n                  result = current_pal_e\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, but what about the case where all characters are the same, like \"aaaaa\". Then, the expanding would correctly find the entire string as the palindrome.\n\nBut let's test another scenario: when two palindromes have the same length but different starting positions. For example, \"banana\" \u2192 which has \"anana\" as a palindrome of length 5 starting at index 1, but also \"nana\" is another palindrome, but shorter.\n\nWait, but the example says it returns \"anana\", which is the largest and lex largest.\n\nAnother example: test case with s = \"abba\".\n\nSo, when i=0, even case is i=0, i+1=1. The code would check s[0] and s[1}: 'a' != 'b', so expansion around even center yields a letter without expansion.\n\nBut, when i=1, the even case is i=1 and i=2: 'b' and 'b' which are equal. So expansion would be from 1,2, then 0,3. s[0] is 'a' and s[3] is 'a', so the expansion would return start=0, end=3, current length is 4. So the current_pal is 'abba'. So the function would find that.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum.\n\nYes, so the code would correctly handle that.\n\nBut then, let's think about the palindrome with the same length but higher lex order.\n\nLike s = \"abcba\" \u2014 wait, what's this case.\n\nBut perhaps more interestingly, s = \"abababa\" \u2014 but maybe not. Let's try a different example.\n\nWait, in the example, suppose s = \"cbbd\". So, the palindromes are 'c', 'b', 'b', 'd', but the even case for i=1 and 2 (s[i] = 'b', s[i+1] = 'b') would expand to left to 0 (s[0] = 'c' which doesn't equal 'b'), so the even palindrome is 'bb', length 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: s = \"racecar\".\n\nThe function should return the entire string, since it's a palindrome. The expand around center for i=3 (the center) would expand to both sides until it covers the entire string.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nBut what about lex order.\n\nSuppose s = \"abcbab\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's not relevant here, but wait, let's see.\n\nAnother example: s = \"abcba\".\n\nWait, the maximum palindrome is length 5, so no, in this case, it's 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat about s = \"aaabaaa\", then it's a palindrome of length 7. So the code would correctly find it.\n\nAnother possible problem: even cases where the expansion is towards the end, but needs to handle indices properly.\n\nI think the expand_around_center function works as long as the initial left and right are valid.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for the even case, when s[i] != s[i+1], the expansion will not occur, so start_even would be i and end_even i+1, but s[i] != s[i+1], so the while loop doesn't run. So the expand_even would return (i, i+1-1? No, let's compute.\n\nWait, the expand function:\n\nWhen called with left=i, right=i+1, and s[i] != s[i+1], the loop condition fails. So left stays i, right stays i+1. So the function returns (i+1, (i+1) -1) \u2192 (i+1, i).\n\nStart_even is i+1, end_even is i.\n\nSo when computing current_pal_e as s[start_e : end_e +1], which is s[i+1 : i+1], which is empty string. So the length is (i+1 - (i+1)) = 0.\n\nWhich is invalid.\n\nSo, in that case, current_len_e would be 0, so the code would continue, because current_len_e is 0.\n\nSo in code, perhaps to avoid that, we need to check that the expanded start is not greater than end. That is, in the main function, after getting start_e and end_e, we compute the length: end_e - start_e +1 > 0.\n\nWait, for the even case, when the initial s[i] != s[i+1], the function returns start_e = i+1, end_e = i. So end_e < start_e. So the length is (i - (i+1) +1) = 0.\n\nSo for the even case, when the expansion doesn't happen (initial characters are different), we can ignore that.\n\nSo in code, when handling even case:\n\nstart_e, end_e = expand(s, i, i+1)\n\nif start_e > end_e:\n\n   continue\n\nElse:\n\n   compute current_pal_e, then process.\n\nBut perhaps in code, after getting start_e and end_e, current_len_e = end_e - start_e +1.\n\nif current_len_e == 0:\n\n   continue.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo in the main code during even expansion:\n\ncall expand, get (start_e, end_e).\n\nif start_e > end_e \u2192 the palindrome is of length 0, so skip.\n\nElse, current_len_e = end_e - start_e +1.\n\nif current_len_e is larger than the current max:\n\n   update result.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, let's see an example.\n\nSo for s = \"ac\", which is len 2.\n\nFor i=0:\n\nhandle odd. Expand s[0], ..., expansion finds 'a' as a palindrome.\n\nThen even case: i=0, i+1=1, s[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'c' which is not equal. So the expansion function returns (1,0) \u2192 which is start_e=1, end_e=0. So start_e > end_e \u2192 skip.\n\nFor i=1:\n\nhandle odd case: pal is 'c'.\n\nnow, after all. So the values processed as:\n\nmax_length is 1, result is 'a' initially.\n\nthen, when i=0, the even case is 'a' and 'c' \u2192 no expansion, so nothing changes.\n\nThen i=0 continues.\n\nWhen i=1, the even case is i+1=2 which is beyond len(s), so even case is skipped.\n\nso after processing, the result is 'a'.\n\nBut according to the example, in 'ac', the function can return either 'a' or 'c' because their lengths are the same. So in the code, when i=1, current_pal is 'c' which is same length as current result 'a'.\n\nSo when i=1, current_pal is 'c', and current_len is 1. Since 1 is equal to max_length (1), and 'c' is larger than 'a', the result is updated to 'c'.\n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nIn the code as I had planned: The initial result is 'a' because at i=0, before even cases, after the odd case. Then, when i=1, it's odd case yields current_pal = 'c'. Since 'c' is lex larger, the result is updated to 'c'.\n\nBut in this scenario, the code would correctly output 'c'.\n\nWait, this tells me that the code will process i=0 first, handle the odd case for i=0 (yielding 'a' with length 1), then process i=0, even case (resulting in nothing). Then i=1, process the odd case, 'c' (length 1), compare to 'a' and choose 'c' because it's lex larger.\n\nSo the code would correctly choose 'c' as the result.\n\nSo perhaps the helper code is correct.\n\nBut in this case, why in the initial code above, the even case doesn't process 'c' but in i=0 there was no even expansion beyond a single step.\n\nWait, perhaps the code as written would correctly handle this.\n\nBut in that case, why in the initial example for 'ac' the function can return 'a' or 'c'? Because the code picks the lex larger one when same length.\n\nYes, that's the correct behavior.\n\nSo, the code seems to be working as intended.\n\nBut now, I need to write the code.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure to handle all cases.\n\nAnother issue is whether the expand function correctly computes the longest possible palindrome for the given center.\n\nYes, the expand function iterates while possible, thus for each center, it ensures maximum expansion.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, now, write the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but the expand_around_center function takes s, left and right. So, in Python, the function can be implemented as:\n\ndef expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n\n    while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n\n        left -=1\n\n        right +=1\n\n    # when returns, the palindrome is s[left+1 ... right-1]\n\n    return (left +1, right -1)\n\nSo, yes.\n\nSo, now, the main function.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nInitialize len(s). If s is empty, return empty string. But according to examples, s is at least length 1.\n\nInitialize result to s[0], max_length =1.\n\nThen, loop through each i in 0..len(s)-1:\n\n    expand for odd length:\n\n        call expand_around_center(s, i, i) \u2192 get start, end.\n\n        current_pal is s[start:end+1].\n\n        current_len is end - start +1.\n\n        compare and update max_length and result.\n\n    if i < len(s)-1:\n\n        expand for even length.\n\n        call expand_around_center(s, i, i+1).\n\n        start_e = ..., end_e = ...\n\n        compute current_pal_e's length.\n\n        if current length is 0 \u2192 skip.\n\n        else:\n\n            compare and update.\n\nBut wait, in code:\n\ndef find_largest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    max_length = 1\n    result = s[0]\n    \n    def expand_around_center(left, right):\n        while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right +=1\n        return (left +1, right-1)\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd case\n        start, end = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        current_length = end - start +1\n        current_pal = s[start:end+1]\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n            result = current_pal\n        elif current_length == max_length:\n            if current_pal > result:\n                result = current_pal\n        # Even case\n        if i < len(s) -1:\n            start_e, end_e = expand_around_center(i, i+1)\n            current_length_e = end_e - start_e +1\n            if current_length_e >0:\n                current_pal_e = s[start_e:end_e+1]\n                if current_length_e > max_length:\n                    max_length = current_length_e\n                    result = current_pal_e\n                elif current_length_e == max_length:\n                    if current_pal_e > result:\n                        result = current_pal_e\n    return result\n\nHmm, but wait, what about the case where there are multiple even and odd palindromes of the same length, and the lex larger one is not correctly captured.\n\nTesting:\n\nTake s = \"ac\", len 2.\n\nProcess i=0:\n\n    odd case: expand to (0,0), pal is 'a', length 1.\n\n    even case: expand_around_center(0,1). s[0]= 'a' != 'c', so (1,0) \u2192 start_e=1, end_e=0. current_length_e is 0, so skip.\n\nSo nothing changes.\n\ni=1:\n\n    odd case: expand to (1,1), current_pal 'c', length 1.\n\n    compare with max_length 1.\n\n    'c' > 'a' \u2192 result becomes 'c'.\n\n    then even case: i=1, which is len(s)-1 \u2192 no even case.\n\nSo finally, result is 'c'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: s = 'abc', expected: 'b' perhaps, but wait, palindromes are 'a' 'b' 'c' of length 1. Lex largest is 'c'.\n\nSo code will correctly process i=2, yield 'c' and update result.\n\nAnother test: s = \"abba\":\n\n- i=0, odd \u2192 gets 'a', len1.\n\ni=0, even: expand 0 and 1: 'a' and 'b' no, so nothing. Next even case ends.\n\ni=1, odd: expand(1,1) \u2192 in the string 'a b b a'.\n\nWait, wait:\n\nNo, s = \"abba\".\n\ni=0:\n\nodd \u2192 expand 0,0: 'a' \u2192 return (0,0) \u2192 len 1.\n\neven case: 0 and1, s[0] is 'a' != s[1] 'b': nothing.\n\ni=1:\n\nodd: expand 1,1: 'b' \u2192 len1, but same as 'a' so since 'b' >'a', result becomes 'b'.\n\neven case: 1 and 2 \u2192 'b' and 'b' are same.\n\nStart expand to 0 and 2: wait, initial left=1, right=2.\n\nWhile loop runs:\n\nleft=0, right=3.\n\ns[0] is 'a', s[3] is 'a', so same. So left = -1, right=4. So function returns (0,3).\n\ncurrent_pal_e is s[0:4] \u2192 'abba' which len4 is larger than current max_length of 1.\n\nSo result becomes 'abba' \u2192 correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\ns = \"babad\".\n\nProcess:\n\ni=0:\n\n   odd: expand returns 0-1: since s[0] is 'b'. So, check possible expansion. But wait, i=0 is the first 'b', but when trying to expand left to -1, so the expansion is as much as possible.\n\nWait, for i=0:\n\nexpand_around_center(0,0):\n\nInitially, s[0] is 'b'.\n\nleft 0, right 0.\n\nleft-1 = -1, which is out of bounds. So the function returns (0,0). So current_pal is 'b'.\n\nWhich is len 1, which is current max.\n\nBut, after i=2, which is 'a' in 'babad' \u2192 at index 2.\n\nWait, i=2.\n\nexpand_around_center(2,2) \u2192 returns (1,3) \u2192 because s[1] is 'a', s[3] is 'a' \u2192 no, wait.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn 'babad', positions 0: 'b', 1:'a', 2: 'b', 3:'a', 4:'d'.\n\nSo for i=1:\n\nodd case: s[1] is 'a' \u2192 expansion around center 1:\n\nstart with left=1, right=1.\n\nThen, check left-1=0 is 'b', right+1=2 is 'b' \u2192 equal.\n\nContinue expanding, left becomes -1.\n\nSo the function returns (0+1=0, 2+1=3) \u2192 start 0, end 3.\n\nSo current_pal is s[0:4] \u2192 'baba'?\n\nWait, s[0:4] is s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3], which is 'baba'.\n\nWait, but that is even-length? Or no, wait.\n\nWait 'baba' is even length.\n\nWait, the function is called for the 'odd' case, which is for i=1, but it's expanding to 0 and 3. So 'b a b a' \u2192 which is a palindrome.\n\nYes.\n\nWait:\n\nIn i=1, it's the 'a' in position1. The expand function looks to left and right, sees that s[0]= 'b' equal to s[2] = 'b' \u2192 yes.\n\nSo start at 0, end at 2: 'bab' \u2192 len3.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, initial i=1, left=1, right=1.\n\nAfter first iteration, left=0, right=2 \u2192 compare. So s[0]==s[2] ('b' == 'b') \u2192 continue.\n\nleft becomes -1, right becomes3.\n\nso, the function returns (0+1, 3-1) \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 start=0, end=2.\n\nWait no:\n\nWait, when the loop stops, the function returns left +1 and right-1.\n\nWait, after expanding as much as possible.\n\nSo when the loop stops, left = -1 and right=3.\n\nSo, expanded as far as possible.\n\nSo s[left+1 : right] \u2192 s[0..2], which is 3 characters.\n\nSo for i=1's odd expansion, the palindrome is 'bab' (len3).\n\nAnd for i=2, which is 'b', the expansion cases:\n\nIn the odd case:\n\nexpand_around_center(2,2): s[2] is 'b' \u2192 expand to right and left.\n\ns[1] is 'a' and s[3] is 'a' \u2192 so expand left to 0, right to4: s[0]='b' and s[4]='d' \u2192 not equal. So the function returns (0,3).\n\nSo for i=2's odd case, the current_pal is s[0:4], 'baba' (len4). Which is larger than the current max, currently 3 for 'bab', so it's longer, so it's selected.\n\nSo what about the even case for i=1.\n\nWhen i=1:\n\neven case is i=1, i+1=2. s[1] = 'a' == s[2] = 'b'? No.\n\nSo the expansion returns (2, 1), which is current_length 0 \u2192 nothing.\n\nBut then, for even case i=2, right?\n\nWait for i=2, the even case is between 2 and3.\n\nWait no; in the code, the even case is when i < len(s)-1, so i=2 is allowed.\n\nBut after processing i=2's even case:\n\nleft=2, right=3 \u2192 s[2] is 'b', s[3] is 'a' \u2192 not equal. So nothing happens.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, what about the 'abba' example.\n\nWhen i=1, even case between 1 and 2 (s[1] 'b' and s[2] 'b'): expansion here gives a larger palindrome.\n\nSo the code correctly processes it.\n\nSo in the 'babad' case:\n\nAt i=0: processes 'b' (len1).\n\ni=1:\n\nodd case \u2192 expands to 'bab' (len3).\n\neven case: s[1] != s[2], so nothing.\n\nAt i=2:\n\nodd case: expands to 'baba' (len4).\n\neven case: s[2] and s[3] \u2192 s[2]= 'b' and s[3] = 'a' \u2192 no, nothing.\n\ni=3:\n\nodd case: 'a' \u2192 s[3], nothing further.\n\neven case: i=3 < len(s)-1? No, because len(s) is 5: i can be 0-4. So i=3 is less than 4, so even case is i=3 and i+1=4.\n\ns[3] is 'a', s[4] is 'd' \u2192 not same, so expansion returns to (4,3) \u2192 len 0.\n\ni=4: processes 'd', no even case.\n\nSo after processing all, the maximum is 'baba' (len4), but in the example, the correct output is either 'bab' or 'aba' ?\n\nWait wait, the example says in \"babad\" the possible outputs are 'bab' or 'aba', but you're getting 'baba' which is len4. But that's longer.\n\nWait wait, but in the example:\n\nThe function is called on 'babad' and in the sample it says it returns 'bab' or 'aba'.\n\nBut according to this code, it would find a longer palindrome.\n\nWait, wait, what's the string 'babad'? It's 'b' 'a' 'b' 'a' 'd'.\n\nSo in the i=1 odd case: it expands to 'bab' (left 0, right2).\n\nIn the i=2 odd case: expanding from 'b' at 2. left=1 is 'a', right=3 is 'a' \u2192 same. Left 0 is 'b', right4 is 'd' \u2192 not same. So 'baba' is from 0 to3 \u2192 'babad' char 0-3 is 'b a b a \u2192 no.\n\nWait no:\n\nNo, s[0:4] would be 0,1,2,3 \u2192 'b a b a'.\n\nWait no, wait s[0] is 'b', s[3] is 'a'.\n\nSo the substring is 'baba' \u2192 is that a palindrome?\n\nYes, 'b a b a' \u2192 mirror of 'a b a b'.\n\nWait, yes. So 'baba' is a palindrome of length 4.\n\nSo why is the example shows 'bab' as a possible return.\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread the sample. Let me check.\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\nSample Input: find_largest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\") \u2192 returns \"bab\" or \"aba\".\n\nWait, in the problem statement's sample, 'babad' is given as an example where the function returns 'bab' or 'aba'.\n\nBut according to my code, the largest palindrome is 'baba' (len4).\n\nWait why?\n\nBecause 'babad' is 'b','a','b','a','d'.\n\nSo the substring 0-3 is 'b a b a' which is a palindrome.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, 'bab' and 'aba' are both len3.\n\nWait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial code.\n\nHold on: in the sample for \"babad\", 'baba' is a substring, but is it a palindrome?\n\nYes, s[0] = 'b' compared to s[3] = 'a'? Wait no, that's not the same.\n\nWait wait, 'b a b a' \u2192 would the first and last characters be 'b' and 'a', which are different. So 'b a b a' can't be a palindrome.\n\nOh wait! So I think I see the mistake.\n\nWait, I thought in the i=2 for 'babad', the expand_around_center(i=2, left=i=2, right=i=2) will first expand as left=1, right=3, which is 'a' and 'a' \u2192 same. Then, left becomes 0, right becomes 4. s[0] is 'b', s[4] is 'd' \u2192 not same. So the expand function returns (0+1,4-1) \u2192 (1,3).\n\nSo the substring is s[1:4] \u2192 indexes 1, 2, 3: which are 'a','b','a' \u2192 'aba' which is len3.\n\nOh! So my earlier analysis was wrong.\n\nI thought the function would return 0,3 for i=2, but that's not correct because in the expand function:\n\nAfter looping, when left is 1, right is 3.\n\nleft-1=0, which is >=0.\n\nright+1=4 < len(s) (5).\n\nCheck s[0] == s[4] \u2192 'b' vs 'd' \u2192 no.\n\nSo the loop stops. So the pal is from 0+1=1 to 4-1=3 \u2192 s[1] to s[3], so 'a b a' \u2192 len3.\n\nSo in that case, what about the even case?\n\nWait in the i=0 even case:\n\nleft=0, right=1 \u2192 s[0]='b' and s[1]='a' \u2192 not same. So returns (1,0), which is len0.\n\nFor i=0, odd case: 'b' \u2192 len1.\n\ni=1:\n\nodd case, i=1.\n\nleft=1, right=1.\n\nleft becomes 0, right becomes2.\n\ns[0] = 'b' and s[2] = 'b' \u2192 same.\n\nleft becomes -1, right becomes3.\n\nSo current_pal is from 0 to2 \u2192 s[0],1,2: 'bab' \u2192 len3.\n\nSo for i=1, the current_pal is 'bab', len3.\n\nWhich is larger than previous max (1), so this becomes the new max.\n\ni=2:\n\nexpand_around_center(i=2, i=2).\n\nagain, as in the earlier case, the expansion gives 'aba' (length3).\n\nSo now, the current max is 3, the result is 'bab' now.\n\nAt i=3, even cases:\n\nfor even i=3:\n\nwhich is i=3, i+1=4: s[3]='a', s[4]='d' \u2192 not same \u2192 no change.\n\nSo the final maximum is 3, and between 'bab' and 'aba' which are same length.\n\nWhich is the lex larger? 'b' is larger than 'a', but in 'bab' and 'aba', 'bab' is larger.\n\nSo in code, when i=2 processes the 'aba' which is len3 and same as max, but 'bab' is lex larger.\n\nSo the code would correctly retain 'bab' as the result.\n\nHmm, but I get.\n\nSo, what is the problem with the previous analysis.\n\nAh! I see my mistake. Earlier, I thought that in i=2, expand_around_center would return a larger palindrome, but that's not the case. Instead, the function correctly returns 'aba', which is a 3-letter palindrome.\n\nSo in the code, the processing is done correctly.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle the 'babad' case correctly.\n\nAnother possible problem: even cases where s has even number of same letters, but the expand function needs to find those.\n\nLike \"cbbd\".\n\ns is 'c','b','b','d'.\n\nThe expected output is 'bb', which is a palindrome len2.\n\nIn the code:\n\ni=0:\n\nodd cases: 'c' \u2192 len1.\n\ni=0, even case: s[0] != s[1] \u2192 no.\n\ni=1:\n\nexpand_around_center(1,1). Initially left=1, right=1.\n\nExpand to left=0, right=2: s[0]='c' != s[2]='b' \u2192 no.\n\nso current_pal is 'b' len1.\n\neven case: i=1, even case is s[1] and s[2] \u2192 'b' and 'b' \u2192 same.\n\nSo start_e and end_e is as per expansion: starting from 1 and 2, expand as long as possible. So:\n\nleft starts at1, right at2.\n\nthey are same, so expand:\n\nleft=0, right=3. s[0]='c' != s[3]='d' \u2192 stop.\n\nso the function returns (1,2).\n\ncurrent_pal_e is 'bb' \u2192 len2.\n\nSo compare to current max (1). So update max_length to2, result to 'bb'.\n\ni=2:\n\nodd case: 'b' \u2192 len1.\n\neven case: i=2 < len(s)-1 (3)? Nope, so even case is not processed.\n\ni=3:\n\nodd case: 'd' \u2192 len1.\n\nEven case: beyond len(s) \u2192 not processed.\n\nThus, code returns 'bb' correctly.\n\nAnother test case: 'banana' \u2192 expected to return 'anana' which is len5.\n\nWait, 'banana' is: positions 0: 'b', 1: 'a', 2: 'n', 3: 'a', 4: 'n', 5:'a'.\n\nSo the possible palindromes of length5 include 'anana'.\n\nBut the code may or may not capture this.\n\nLet me test:\n\ni=1:\n\nProcessing i=1 (odd), expand.\n\nLeft=1, right=1.\n\nExpand to left=0 ('b'), right=2 ('n')-> not same. So current_pal is 'a' len1.\n\ni=2 (odd):\n\nleft=2, right=2.\n\nexpand to left=1, right=3: 'a' and 'a' \u2192 same. Then, expand further: left=0 ('b'), right=4 ('n') \u2192 'b' != 'n' \u2192 stop.\n\nSo start is 1, end is 3: 'a a' len3.\n\nWait no. Wait 1+1 =2? Wait, the expand_around_center would return (0: no? Let me recompute.\n\nWait, after expansion:\n\ninitial left = right =2.\n\nThen, in loop:\n\nleft becomes1, right becomes3 \u2192 s[1] is 'a' == s[3] 'a' \u2192 continue.\n\nleft becomes0, right becomes4 \u2192 s[0] is 'b' vs s[4] 'n' \u2192 no.\n\nso, expand returns (0+1=1,4-1=3) \u2192 so current pal is s[1 to3+1] \u2192 s[1:4], which is 'a n a' \u2192 len3.\n\nSo current_pal is 'ana' \u2192 len3.\n\nWhat about when i=3 (odd):\n\nleft 3 \u2192 s[3] is 'a'.\n\nExpand:\n\nleft-1=2, right+1=4: s[2] is 'n' and s[4] is 'n' \u2192 same.\n\nso expand to left=1, right=5.\n\ns[1] is 'a' and s[5] is 'a' \u2192 same.\n\nso expand to left=0, right=6 \u2192 which is beyond len(s) \u2192 invalid.\n\nso expand function returns (0: no, left=0 is >=0, right=6 is out of range.\n\nso left becomes0 is >=0, right+1 is6.\n\nso return (0+1, 5).\n\nStart is1, end is5.\n\ncurrent_pal is s[1:6] \u2192 from i=1 to5, 'a nana'?\n\nWait wait, s[1] is 'a', s[5] is 'a' \u2192 in between, should it form a palindrome.\n\nWait, 'a n a n a' \u2192 yes.\n\nWait in the string 'banana', the substring s[1:6+1? Or 1:5+1.\n\nWait, in Python syntax, s[start : end], the end is exclusive.\n\nSo in the expand_around_center function, returns (left+1, right-1). So for i=3, after expansion, start=0+1=1, end=6-1=5. So current_pal is s[1:5+1], which is from 1 to5 inclusive.\n\nSo the substring is 'a n a n a' \u2192 which is 'anana' len5.\n\nSo current_length_e for this is5.\n\nWhich is longer than the previous max.\n\nSo the code would correctly process it.\n\nThus, in this case, the code would find the 'anana' when i=3.\n\nSo, when i=3:\n\ncurrent_length =5.\n\nWhich is longer than the previous max (3 for 'ana' in i=2).\n\nSo the result is updated to 'anana'.\n\nThus, the code works as intended.\n\nThus, with numerous test cases processed, the code seems to handle all.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nWait, but in the code, the expand_even is handled correctly.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nSo now, let me write the code accordingly.\n\nThe function is written as follows:\n\nCheck for the empty string.\n\nInitialize variables.\n\nThen, define the helper function inside the main function.\n\nLoop through each i.\n\nHandle odd and even cases.\n\nReturn the result.\n\nThus, the code as above.\n\nSo I think this should solve the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the largest palindromic substring in a given string. If there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length, we return the lexicographically largest one.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using an \"expand around center\" technique to efficiently find all possible palindromic substrings. This technique considers each character and each pair of consecutive characters as potential centers of a palindrome and expands outwards as long as the characters on both sides are equal.\n\n1. **Expand Around Center**: For each character in the string, treat it as the center of a potential palindrome and expand outwards in both directions. Similarly, for each pair of consecutive characters, treat them as the center of an even-length palindrome and expand outwards.\n2. **Track the Longest Palindrome**: Keep track of the longest palindrome found. If multiple palindromes of the same length are found, compare their lexicographical order and keep the largest one.\n3. **Helper Function**: Use a helper function `expand_around_center` to handle the expansion around a given center. This function returns the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found around that center.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_largest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    max_length = 1\n    result = s[0]\n    \n    def expand_around_center(left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return (left + 1, right - 1)\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd length palindromes\n        start, end = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        current_length = end - start + 1\n        current_pal = s[start:end+1]\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n            result = current_pal\n        elif current_length == max_length:\n            if current_pal > result:\n                result = current_pal\n        \n        # Even length palindromes\n        if i < len(s) - 1:\n            start_e, end_e = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)\n            current_length_e = end_e - start_e + 1\n            if current_length_e > 0:\n                current_pal_e = s[start_e:end_e+1]\n                if current_length_e > max_length:\n                    max_length = current_length_e\n                    result = current_pal_e\n                elif current_length_e == max_length:\n                    if current_pal_e > result:\n                        result = current_pal_e\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum length to 1 and the result as the first character of the string, since the smallest palindrome is a single character.\n2. **Expand Around Center**: Define a helper function `expand_around_center` that takes two indices, `left` and `right`, and expands outwards as long as the characters at these indices are equal. This function returns the start and end indices of the palindrome found.\n3. **Iterate Through Centers**: Loop through each character in the string, treating each as the center for both odd-length and even-length palindromes. Expand around these centers to find the longest palindrome.\n4. **Update Results**: For each palindrome found, update the result if the current palindrome is longer than the previous maximum length. If it's the same length, update the result if the current palindrome is lexicographically larger.\n5. **Return Result**: After processing all possible centers, return the largest palindrome found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest and lexicographically largest palindrome using an optimal expansion technique, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.",
