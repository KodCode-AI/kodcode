  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest palindromic substring's length in a given string. Hmm, I remember that a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So, the task is to find the maximum length of such substrings.\n\nWait, let me think about the examples they gave. Like for \"babad\", the output is 3 because \"bab\" is a palindrome. Oh right, because other possibilities like \"aba\" and \"bab\" both are palindromes here. So the function should identify the maximum possible.\n\nI also remember there's an efficient way to do this, maybe using expand around center approach? Or was it the Manacher's algorithm? But I think the expand around center is more straightforward, especially for someone still learning.\n\nSo expand around center idea: for each character in the string, consider it as the center and expand outwards as long as the substring is a palindrome. This works for both odd and even length palindromes, right? Because for odd length, the center is a single character, and for even, it's between two same characters.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle both cases? Oh right, I can loop through each character, treat it as the center for odd cases, and for even cases, check between the current and next character.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. For each character, expand around it as the center for odd length.\n3. Also, expand around the space between this character and the next for even length.\n4. Keep track of the maximum length found so far.\n\nWait, but how exactly do I do this expansion? Like, after choosing a center, I'll have two pointers, left and right. Starting from the center, I move left and right while the characters are equal and within the string bounds. Each time they match, I can increase the length.\n\nFor example, for the string \"racecar\":\n- Starting at index 3 (the 'e'), expand to left and right, which are 'c' and 'c', then 'a' and 'a', then 'r' and 'r'. That gives a length of 7.\n\nAnother example, \"ccc\":\n- At first index, expanding will cover all three.\n\nWhat about the base case? If the string is empty, return 0. If the string is one character, return 1. So need to handle those.\n\nNow, writing the code:\n\nHmm, I'll need to write helper functions or nested functions. Wait, in Python, perhaps not necessary. I can just create a function within or variables that hold the current max length.\n\nLet me sketch the code outline:\n\nInitialize the maximum length to 0.\n\nFor each index in the string from 0 to len(s)-1:\n    Check for the maximum palindrome with center at i (for odd length)\n    Update the max_len.\n    Check for the maximum palindrome with centers at i and i+1 (for even length)\n    Update the max_len.\n\nSo in code, perhaps a helper function that given a left and right, expands as much as possible and returns the length.\n\nWait, maybe create a function that takes left and right and expands. So, like:\n\ndef expand(s, left, right):\n    while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -=1\n        right +=1\n    # When the loop exits, right - left +1 would give the length minus 2 because it went one step too far.\n    return right - left - 1\n\nWait, let's think: for \"a\", if we pass left=0, right=0. The loop condition will see s[0]==s[0], so it'll subtract left to -1 and add right to 1. Then return 1 - (-1) -1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, for even, like \"bb\". We call expand with left=0, right=1.\n\nInside the loop, s[0] and s[1] are 'b's. So step left to -1, right to 2. Then the loop stops. So right - left -1 is 2 - (-1) -1 =2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the helper function seems to work.\n\nSo in the main function, for each i, I call expand for i,i to handle odd-length, and then expand for i,i+1 for even.\n\nCompare the lengths each time to update the max_len.\n\nSo the steps are: For each i in 0 to len(s)-1:\n\nmax_len = max(max_len, expand(i,i), expand(i,i+1))\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the helper function return the length. So comparing the current max with both calls.\n\nWait, the helper function can return the maximum possible length starting from the given left and right. So in the main loop:\n\ncurrent_max = expand(s, i, i)\nif current_max > max_len:\n    max_len = current_max\n\ncurrent_max = expand(s, i, i+1)\nif current_max > max_len:\n    max_len = current_max\n\nWait, that's redundant. Maybe just compute both and take the maximum each time.\n\nBut code can be written succinctly.\n\nNow, what about the cases?\n\nTest case \"babad\":\n\nIndices 0: 'b' expand to get 1 (just 'b').\nEven case: i=0, char 0 and 1. Are they same? 'b' and 'a'\u2014no, so returns 0.\nThen indices 1: 'a' expands. 'a' and as far as possible. But in \"babad\", when i=1, after expansion, you get 'aba' which is length 3.\nHence, max is 3.\n\nAnother test case: \"cbbd\"\n\nFor each i:\ni=0: expand to 1 (c).\ni=0 and i+1: 'c' and 'b'\u2014no, returns 0.\ni=1: 'b' -> expands to 'bb' which is length 2.\nAlso, check 'c' and 'd' for even: no. But the max so far is 2.\nSo the function returns 2.\n\nWhat about the empty string? If s is empty, the for loop doesn't run, max remains 0, correct.\n\nWhat about a single character? The for loop runs once, expand(i,i) returns 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, handling all these. So now, time to write the code.\n\nBut wait, I should handle the case where the string is empty up front, perhaps. Because if s is empty, the loop won't run and max remains 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: what about time complexity? For each character, we potentially expand twice, and each expansion is O(n), overall O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints as it's specified for Python.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n    if not s:\n        return 0\n    max_len = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # odd length\n        len1 = expand(s, i, i)\n        # even length\n        len2 = expand(s, i, i +1)\n        current_max = max(len1, len2)\n        if current_max > max_len:\n            max_len = current_max\n    return max_len\n\ndef expand(s, left, right):\n    while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -=1\n        right +=1\n    return right - left -1\n\nWait, but every time expand is called, it goes as far as possible. So that should encompass all possibilities.\n\nTesting with some examples:\n\nTest case: \"a\"\ni=0, len1 is 1 (from expand(0,0). len2 is expand(0,1)\u2014since right would be 1 which is beyond len(s) (since len is 1, 1 is not < 1), so the loop is not entered, right -left-1 =1 -0-1=0. So current_max is 1. So return 1.\n\nTest case: \"aaa\"\n\nFor i=1:\nlen1 = expand(1,1): will expand as left goes to 0, etc. So s[0] =a, s[2]=a, s[3...? No, wait: expand will go as far as possible.\n\nWait, when s is \"aaa\":\nFor i=1, expand(i,i) starts with left=1, right=1.\nIn the loop:\nleft=1, right=1: equal, left=0, right=2.\nCheck again, s[0]=a, s[2]=a: equal. left becomes -1, right becomes 3.\nSo returns:3 - (-1) -1= 3. So len1 is 3.\n\nBut wait, for \"aaa\":\n\nBut from i=0, the expand(0,0) would do:\n\nleft=0, right=0: expand to left= -1 and right=1, then to left=-2: no.\n\nWait wait, in the loop:\n\nFirst, left=0, right=0: they are equal, so left-=1 (becomes -1), right +=1 (becomes 1). Then loop checks if left>=0 which is now false. So returns (1 - (-1) -1 )=1.\n\nThen, in the even case, expand(0,1) gives:\n\ns[0] = a, s[1]=a. So expand to left -1, right 2. Then s[-1] is beyond, so return 2- (-1) -1=2.\n\nSo len1 for i=0 is 1, len2 is 2. Current max becomes 2.\n\nBut when i=1, len1 is 3, so the max_len becomes 3.\n\nWhich is correct, and \"aaa\" returns 3.\n\nAnother test case: \"racecar\": should return 7.\n\ni=3 (e), expand from s[3], left=3, right=3. Then expand to 2 and 4, 1 and5, 0 and6. So returns 7.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about when s is \"ac\"? So len is 2.\n\nFor i=0: len1=1, len2 (even case) expand(0,1). s[0] != s[1], so returns 0. So current_max is 1.\nFor i=1: len1=1, len2=expand(1,2) which is 0 (char 1 is 'c', next is beyond). So current_max remains 1.\nSo overall, max_len remains 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: \"ccc\" \u2014 returns 3.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo translating this into Python, adding the expand function inside the main function or as a nested function.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I can make it a nested helper function? Or perhaps define it inside.\n\nAlternatively, write the expand logic inline.\n\nWait, in Python, you can't have functions inside another function if you're writing the solution as part of a script, but in this case, since the function is to be defined as the solution, the helper can be a nested function.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nImplement expand as a helper function inside longest_palindrome_length.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n    def expand(left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1  # Because the loop ends when the characters don't match, so the last increment was beyond. So the length is right-left-1.\n\n    max_length = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Odd length palindrome with center at i\n        len1 = expand(i, i)\n        # Even length palindrome with centers at i and i+1\n        len2 = expand(i, i+1)\n        current_max = max(len1, len2)\n        if current_max > max_length:\n            max_length = current_max\n    return max_length\n\nWait, but if s is empty, the function returns 0 which is correct. For s of length 1, the i runs 0, expand(0,0) returns 1, which is correct.\n\nTesting with all the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: \"babad\" \u2192 function should return 3.\n\nSample 2: \"cbbd\" \u2192 returns 2.\n\nSample 3: \"a\" \u2192 1.\n\nSample 4: \"ac\" \u21921.\n\nSample 5: \"\" \u21920.\n\nSample 6: \"ccc\" \u21923.\n\nSample7: \"banana\" \u21925.\n\nWait, banana is \"banana\".\n\nLet's see. The possible palindromes: e.g., \"anana\" is length 5.\n\nLet's see how the code would handle it.\n\nIn \"banana\", the letters are indices 0-5:\n\nIndices 0: 'b'; expand around 0 and 0 gives 1.\n\nExpand around 0 and1: 'b' vs 'a' \u2192 no, 0.\n\nThen i=1: 'a'.\n\nOdd expansion: goes to s[0], then s[2] (a and a). Then s[0] is b, which does not match, so returns 3 (length from 0 to 2? Wait, how does it calculate.\n\nWait, when i=1:\n\nlen1 = expand(1,1).\n\nCheck: s[0] and s[2] are 'b' and 'a'? No, wait no \u2014 wait 'banana' is b a n a n a.\n\nWait i=1: s[1] is a.\n\nExpand: left=1, right=1: then check if s[0]==s[2]. 'a' is no. So the while loop only executes once (since at left=1, right=1, s[left]==s[right]; then left becomes 0, right becomes 2. Now, s[0]=b, s[2]=n \u2192 not equal. So while loop exits.\n\nSo right is 2, left is 0.\n\nreturn 2 -0 -1 =1. So len1 is 1.\n\nlen2: expand(1,2). s[1] is a, s[2] is n: not equal. So returns 0.\n\nSo nothing changes. So current_max for i=1 is 1.\n\nFor i=0: len1=1, len2=0. max remains 0.\n\ni=2: 'n'\n\nlen1: expand(2,2). Check s[1] and s[ 3]\u2014a and a. So can expand to s[1] and s[3}. Then s[0) 'b' and s[4} \u2192 'n' 'n'? No.\n\nWait, let's think.\n\ns = \"banana\"\n\ns[2] is n. Expanding around 2.\n\nOutside the 'n' in the middle, maybe.\n\nWait, left and right are 2 and 2. then step to 1 and 3: a and a. So equal, continue.\n\nthen to 0 and4: 'b' and 'n' \u2192 not equal. So the len is 3 - 0 -1: Wait, no, wait expand function returns right -left -1, so 3 is the value when after the loop.\n\nWait, during the loop:\n\nleft starts at 2, right at 2.\n\nThen after expansion, left becomes1, right 3. s[1]=a, s[3]=a: same. left becomes0, right 4. s[0]=b, s[4]=n: different. So loop exits.\n\nSo right=4, left=0.\n\nSo right - left -1 =4-0-1=3. So len1 is 3.\n\nlen2: expand(2,3). s[2]=n, s[3}=a: not same, len is 0. So current_max is 3. So max_len becomes 3.\n\ni=3: s[3] is a.\n\nlen1: expand(3,3) \u2192 check s[2] and s[4}: 'n' and 'n': same. So left becomes2 right becomes5: s[2]=n, s[5}=a: not same. So len is 5- 2-1:5-2-1=2.\n\nBut wait, it is a palindrome of length 1 + 2*1=3?\n\nNo, len1: when i=3. So right and left start at 3.\n\nThen, left becomes2, right becomes4 (checking a and n\u2014but no, wait s[3 is a, expand to check s[2] and s[4}: 'n' and 'n'? Yes. So left becomes1, right 5.\n\ns[1}=a, s[5}=a. They are same, so left becomes0, right 6.\n\ns[0}=b, s[6} is beyond. So loop exits.\n\nSo at end, left is 0, right is6.\n\nSo expand returns 6 -0 -1 =5.\n\nAh, right. len1 for i=3 is 5.\n\nWhich is correct, because 'anana' is the palindrome.\n\nlen2 is expand(3,4): s[3}=a, s[4}=n. Not same, so len is 0.\n\ncurrent_max is 5, which becomes the new max.\n\nSo in this case, the code would return 5, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code seems to handle all the test cases correctly.\n\nWait, wait, in the case of \"cbbd\" \u2014 s[1] is 'b', expanding around odd center returns 2 for i=1, and for the even case, also expanding beyond.\n\nYes, for 'cbbd', i=2 (s[2] is 'b'), and i+1 is 3.\n\nexpand(2,2): let's see, s[2] is b. expand to left 1 and right 3, which are 'b' and 'd'\u2014no.\n\nSo len1 is 1. len2 is expand(2,3) \u2192 s[2:3] are 'b' and 'd: no, so len is 0. But for i=1, len1 is from expand(1,1) \u2192 'b', expand to left 0 (c) and right 2 (b)\u2014so no. So len1 is 1. len2 is expand(1,2) \u2192 'b' and 'b'\u2014so can expand to left 0 (s[0]=c and right 3 (s[3}=d \u2192 not same.\n\nlenn is 2-0-1=2- (-1 +1?) Wait no.\n\nWait expand(1,2):\n\ns[1] and s[2] are 'b's \u2192 same.\n\nso expand to left=0, right=3. s[0}=c, s[3}=d: not same.\n\nso expand returns 3-0-1=2.\n\nSo len2 is 2.\n\nSo for i=1, len2 is 2, which is bigger than len1 of 1. So current_max becomes 2, which is the correct max len for this string.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases and passes all the test examples.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The approach to solve this problem efficiently involves expanding around potential centers of palindromes.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using an \"expand around center\" technique. For each character in the string, we consider it as the center of a potential palindrome and expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides are equal. This technique allows us to check both odd and even length palindromes efficiently.\n\n1. **Expand Around Center**: For each character in the string, we treat it as the center of an odd-length palindrome and expand outwards. Additionally, we also treat the gap between each pair of consecutive characters as the center for even-length palindromes and expand outwards.\n2. **Helper Function**: A helper function `expand` is used to handle the expansion around a given center. It returns the length of the longest palindrome found starting from that center.\n3. **Track Maximum Length**: For each character in the string, we compute the maximum length of the palindrome found using both odd and even centers and update the overall maximum length accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n    def expand(left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n\n    max_length = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        len1 = expand(i, i)\n        len2 = expand(i, i + 1)\n        current_max = max(len1, len2)\n        if current_max > max_length:\n            max_length = current_max\n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Expand Function**: The `expand` function takes two indices, `left` and `right`, and expands outwards as long as the characters at these indices are equal. It returns the length of the palindrome found.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string, we call `expand` twice: once for the odd-length palindrome centered at the character and once for the even-length palindrome centered between the character and the next one.\n3. **Update Maximum Length**: We keep track of the maximum length of the palindrome found during the iterations and return this value as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible palindromic substrings, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for this problem.",
