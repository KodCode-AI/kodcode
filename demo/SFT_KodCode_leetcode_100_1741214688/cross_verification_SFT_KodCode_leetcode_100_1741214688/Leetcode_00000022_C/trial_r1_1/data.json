  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the length of the longest palindromic substring in a given string. Hmm, I remember that a palindrome reads the same backward as forward. So I have to check all possible substrings and see which is the longest one that's a palindrome.\n\nWait, how do I approach this efficiently? Because if I check every possible substring, that might be too slow, especially for longer strings. Oh right, for coding interviews, I need an efficient method, not a brute-force one.\n\nI recall something about expanding around the center. Oh right! For each character in the string, I can treat it as the center and expand outwards in both directions to find the maximum length palindrome. But wait, what about even-length palindromes? Like \"abba\" \u2014 the center is between the two 'b's. So I think I need to handle both odd and even cases. That means for each position, I do two expansions: one considering the center as that character (for odd-length palindromes) and one considering the center between that character and the next (for even-length).\n\nSo my plan is: iterate through each character in the string. For each, expand in both directions as long as the characters on both sides are equal. Keep track of the maximum length found.\n\nLet me think about the steps. For each index i from 0 to n-1, I'll do the following:\n\n1. Expand around i as the center for an odd-length palindrome.\n   - Initialize two pointers, left and right, both starting at i.\n   - While left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right], increment max_length.\n   - Move left back and right forward each step until they stop matching.\n\n2. Expand around i and i+1 as centers for an even-length palindrome.\n   - Initialize left to i, right to i+1.\n   - While left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right], do the same.\n\nEach time, calculate the length of the current palindrome and update the max if it's longer.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the length correctly? Like, when I expand from center to both sides, the length is (right - left + 1). So as I expand each step, the length increases by 2 each time, but I can just calculate it each time before adding to the max.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep track as I expand: initialize the current length as 1 for odd, check expansion steps, and compute.\n\nBut perhaps a function can help. Maybe create a helper function that takes left and right pointers and keeps expanding as long as characters are equal and the indices are valid. Then return the length of that palindrome.\n\nOh right, helper function. That might make the code cleaner. So for each i, I'll call this helper twice: once with (i, i) for odd length, and once with (i, i+1) for even. Then take the maximum of those two and compare it to the overall max.\n\nWhat's the helper function do exactly? It takes left and right, and increments left and right as long as they are within bounds and s[left] == s[right]. Then, the length is right - left -1? Wait, no. Because each expansion step adds one to each side. So the initial left is i, right is j (could be i or i+1). Then, for each step away, we check, and if valid, expand. The number of steps might give the radius, but the length would be (right - left + 1) at the end.\n\nLet me see: example, for \"babad\". i is 2 (the 'a'). Odd expansion: left=2, right=2. Then next, left decreases to 1, right increases to 3. They are equal (both 'b's). Then left 0, right 4 are 'b' and 'd' which are not equal. So the palindrome is from 1 to 3, which is length 3.\n\nFor the even case: when between 'a' and 'b' in \"cbbd\", i is 1 (the 'b'). Even expansion: left=1, right=2. Both are 'b's, so it's a palindrome of length 2.\n\nSo the helper function should calculate the maximum possible expansion from its given left and right.\n\nLet me write pseudocode:\n\ndef helper(s, left, right):\n    while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        expand further\n    return the length of the longest palindrome\n\nWait, no. Wait, how to calculate the length as we expand.\n\nActually, after expansion, the maximum palindrome is from the left to right indices before the loop ends. We can calculate the length as right - left + 1 after the loop.\n\nBut perhaps during the expansion, each step adds one more step. But regardless, the helper function can return the maximum length of a palindrome that starts at left and right.\n\nSo let's code the helper function. It takes left and right, and it returns the maximum length of the palindrome centered around them.\n\nHmm, but in the case where s[left] != s[right] initially, the length is zero, I suppose.\n\nWait, in the even case, what if the initial left == right? Like when i and i+1? So if s[i] == s[i+1], then the initial step is a length of 2, then we expand further.\n\nWait, I think the helper function can be implemented as:\n\ndef expand_from_center(s, left, right):\n    # while the characters are equal and within the string bounds\n    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -= 1\n        right += 1\n    # after expansion, the valid palindrome is from left+1 to right-1\n    # calculate the length\n    return right - left - 1\n\nWait, think about when the expansion couldn't proceed beyond the initial step.\n\nCase 1: i starts at 0. expand around i=0.\n\nIf s[0] == s[0], then in the first iteration, left becomes -1, right becomes 1. The loop breaks.\n\nThen, the palindrome starts at left + 1 = 0, ends at right-1=0. So length is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: for \"ccc\". Let's say i=1. Expand from center (1,1). Then left=0, right=2 in the next step, both 'c's. Then left becomes -1, right 3. So length is (2 - (-1)) -1 = 3-1=3?, or 3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the calculation wrong.\n\nWait, after expanding, what's the actual start and end of the palindrome? Because during the expansion, the loop breaks when left or right goes out of bounds, or s[left] != s[right]. So the last valid left and right would have been when s[left] == s[right].\n\nSo the start is left +1 and end is right -1.\n\nIn the example with \"ccc\":\n\n- When i=1, the initial call is to expand from center (1,1). The loop starts:\n\n-- first iteration: left=0, right=2. s[0] == s[2]? yes. So s[left] and s[right] are c and c. So expand. left becomes -1, right becomes 3.\n\nNow, loop condition: left is >=0? No, because it's -1. So loop breaks.\n\nSo the end is right-1 = 2. Start is left+1 =0. So the substring from 0 to 2, which includes the entire string. The length is 3.\n\nSo yes, the return value in this case would be 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but after expanding, how is the return value calculated. Because for the while loop condition, after the loop, left and right are beyond the palindrome. So the actual palindrome is from left+1 to right-1, which is the substring s[left+1 ... right-1]. So the length is (right-1) - (left+1) +1 = right-1 - left -1 +1 = right - left -1-0. So the length is right - left -1.\n\nWait wait: for \"c's case, (right-left-1) is 3 - (-1) -1 = 3 +1 -1 =3. Correct.\n\nAnother example, when the expansion couldn't go beyond initial step: i=0, in 'ac'. For (0,0): left becomes -1, right 1. So length is 1 - (-1) -1 = 1-1=0? But that's not correct. Wait, no: 1 - (-1) is 2, minus 1 is 1. So the length is 1.\n\nYes, because the palindrome for (0,0) is just 'a', which is length 1.\n\nAh, I think the helper function correctly returns the length.\n\nSo, now, in the main function:\n\nInitialize max_length to 0.\n\nFor each i in 0 to len(s)-1:\n\n   odd_length = expand_from_center(s, i, i)\n\n   even_length = expand_from_center(s, i, i+1)\n\n   current_max = max(odd_length, even_length)\n\n   if current_max > max_length:\n\n       max_length = current_max\n\nAt the end, return max_length.\n\nWait, but what about edge cases:\n\nFor empty string s (when len(s) is 0), max_length is 0, which is correct.\n\nFor single character: returns the helper function which returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: 'racecar' is 'racecar'. Let's see. i=3, the middle 'e'. expand in both directions, which will get the entire string. odd_length is 7. So the max is 7.\n\nAnother test case: 'banana' is 'banana', which has the palindrome 'anana' (length 5). The code should capture that. Let's think: center between a and n perhaps.\n\nWait i=1 is 'a' in 'b a n a n a'. So odd expansion from i=1 gives up to 'a' on both sides. Wait maybe not; perhaps it's better to step through, but I think the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo seems like this approach will find all possible palindromes by considering each center.\n\nWhat's the time complexity? Each expansion takes O(n) time, and each center is checked once, so there are 2n expansions (because for each i, two expansion calls). So total time is O(n^2). Which is acceptable for n up to 10^3 or 10^4.\n\nSo now, the code:\n\nImplement the expand_from_center function. But wait, how to implement it in Python?\n\nWait, but if I write the helper as a function inside longest_palindrome_length, that's not a problem.\n\nBut wait, perhaps integrating it within the function would be better.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nInitialize max_length as 0.\n\nLoop through each i in range(len(s)).\n\n   for each i, compute the odd length and even length:\n\n   odd = expand_from_center(s, i, i)\n\n   even = expand_from_center(s, i, i+1)\n\n   current_max = max(odd, even)\n\n   if current_max > max_length:\n\n       max_length = current_max\n\nAt the end, return max_length.\n\nNow, let me write the code.\n\nWait, but in the helper function, how to track the expansion:\n\nWait, but perhaps to avoid a helper function, I can expand in-line, but that would result in code duplication.\n\nProbably, better to have the helper.\n\nImplement expand_from_center:\n\ndef expand_from_center(s, left, right):\n    while left >=0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -=1\n        right +=1\n    # After loop, the current left and right are beyond the palindrome.\n    # So the length is (right - left -1)\n    return right - left - 1\n\nTesting this function:\n\nCase 1: s = 'a', i=0. expand_from_center(s,0,0). After loop, left is -1, right is 1. So 1 - (-1) -1 = 1. Correct.\n\nCase 2: s = 'abba', i=1 (the second 'b' at index 1). Expand to odd: It goes as far as possible.\n\nWait, wait, let me think.\n\nWait the main loop for each i would have to call both helper functions. Let me see.\n\nFor 'cbbd', the even expansion is longer at i=1: the even call is expand(1,2) which returns 2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i, we call expand on both (i,i) and (i, i+1), compute the maximum of the two, compare with the global max.\n\nSo the code should handle all test cases.\n\nWait but in the sample input 'cbbd' the longest palindrome is 'bb' with length 2.\n\nLet me check what the code does.\n\nlength is 4.\n\ni=0:\n\n   odd = expand(0,0)\n\n       left=0, right=0: s[0]= 'c'\n\n       in loop, left-- (becomes -1), right++(1). Now, s[-1] is invalid. So length is 1-(-1) -1 = 1.\n\n   even = expand(0,1). s[0] is 'c', s[1] is 'b' \u2014 not equal, so loop doesn't run. So returns 0.\n\n   current max is max(1,0)=1.\n\ni=1:\n\n   odd: expand(1,1). s[1] = 'b'\n\n       left decrements to 0, right increments to 2.\n\n       s[0] = 'c', s[2]='b' \u2192 are they equal? No. So the expansion stops. So the palindrome from 1 to1 \u2192 length 1.\n\n   even: expand(1,2): s[1] is 'b' and s[2] is 'b' \u2192 equal. So left is 1, right 2.\n\n   loop: left-- (0), right++(3). Now, s[0] is 'c', s[3] is 'd' \u2192 not equal. So expansion stops. The length is (3-0 -1) = 2.\n\n   So current_max is 2, which is larger than current global max of 1. So update.\n\ni=2:\n\n   odd: expand(2,2). s[2] is 'b', expand:\n\n   left 1, right 3.\n\n   s[1] is 'b', s[3] is 'd' \u2192 not equal. So expansion stops. So length is 1.\n\n   even: expand(2,3). s[2]= 'b', s[3]='d' \u2192 not equal. So return 0.\n\n   current_max is 1.\n\ni=3:\n\n   odd: expand(3,3) \u2192 'd' \u2192 length 1.\n\n   even: expand(3,4) which is beyond. length 0.\n\n   current_max is 1.\n\nSo overall max is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the empty string, it returns 0.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWait, the function signature is:\n\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n\nSo code outline:\n\nif not s:\n\n   return 0\n\nn = len(s)\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   # odd length\n\n   len1 = expand_from_center(s, i, i)\n\n   # even length\n\n   len2 = expand_from_center(s, i, i+1)\n\n   current_max = max(len1, len2)\n\n   if current_max > max_len:\n\n       max_len = current_max\n\nreturn max_len\n\nWait, but what if s is empty before for loop? For example, in the sample where s is \"\", returns 0.\n\nIn code:\n\nif s is empty, the for loop runs 0 times, and max_len remains 0, which is correct.\n\nTesting, yes.\n\nWait, what about when the string has maximum possible palindrome of even and odd length?\n\nLike in 'racecar', the function would find the 7-length palindrome.\n\nWait, 'racecar' has 7 characters. i is 3.\n\nAt i=3, expand_from_center with i=3, i=3: it expands on both sides until it finds the entire length.\n\nLet me see:\n\ns = 'r','a','c','e','c','a','r' (indices 0-6).\n\nExpand from i=3, i=3.\n\nbegin:\n\nleft =3, right=3.\n\ns[3] == s[3] \u2192 yes.\n\nleft=2, right=4: c and c \u2192 yes.\n\nleft=1, right=5: a and a \u2192 yes.\n\nleft=0, right=6: r and r \u2192 yes.\n\nleft=-1, right=7 \u2192 while loop stops.\n\nThe length is right - left -1 = 7 - (-1) -1 = 7.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo in code, len1 is 7 for i=3.\n\nSo the code should return 7.\n\nAnother test case: 'ccc' \u2192 returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about 'ac'? it's 'a' and 'c' \u2192 longest is 1.\n\nSo the code for i=0: expand(0,0) returns 1 (or (1-(-1)-1=1). expand(0,1) returns 0 since s[0]=a and s[1]=c not same.\n\nfor i=1: expand(1,1) returns 1, expand(1,2) returns 0 \u2192 current_max is 1.\n\nSo overall max is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'banana' \u2192 should return 5. 'anana' is length 5.\n\nLet me see the code.\n\ns = 'banana'\n\nIndices: 0: b, 1: a, 2: n, 3: a, 4: n, 5:a.\n\ni=1:\n\nodd length: expand(1,1) \u2192 'a' \u2192 expand until:\n\nleft=0, right=2. s[0]=b, s[2]=n \u2192 no. So pal length is 1.\n\neven: expand(1,2). s[1]=a, s[2]=n \u2192 no expansion.\n\nso len is 0.\n\nSo for i=1, current max is 1.\n\ni=2:\n\nexpand(2,3) for even?\n\nWait, let's see i=3.\n\nWait I think the center for 'anana' is i=3, but what about i=3:\n\ns[i] = a.\n\nodd expansion: expand(3,3) \u2192 expand s[3-1=2] = n, s[3+1=4] =n \u2192 same.\n\nso left becomes 2, right 4.\n\ns[2]=n, s[4]=n \u2192 same.\n\nleft becomes 1, right 5.\n\ns[1]=a and s[5]=a \u2192 same.\n\nleft becomes 0, right 6 (out of bounds, since len=6).\n\nso the length is 6 (from 0 to 5-1). No, wait, the function returns (right - left -1) = 6 -0-1 =5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code would, at i=3, compute len1=5.\n\nSo max becomes 5.\n\nSo code returns 5.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' \u2192 returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all test cases.\n\nSo, the final code will implement this approach.\n\nNow, the code is as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. The approach used here efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring by considering each character as a potential center and expanding outwards to find the longest palindrome.\n\n### Approach\nThe solution involves treating each character in the string as a center of a potential palindrome and expanding outwards in both directions. This approach handles both odd and even length palindromes:\n1. **Odd Length Palindromes**: These have a single central character. For example, in \"aba,\" 'b' is the center.\n2. **Even Length Palindromes**: These have two central characters. For example, in \"abba,\" the centers are the two 'b's.\n\nFor each character in the string, we expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides are equal. This is done using a helper function that takes two pointers (left and right) and returns the length of the longest palindrome found from those starting points.\n\nThe approach iterates through each character, calculates the maximum length of the palindrome for both odd and even cases, and keeps track of the overall maximum length found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n    def expand_from_center(left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1  # After expansion, length is right-left-1\n\n    max_len = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Check for odd length palindromes\n        len1 = expand_from_center(i, i)\n        # Check for even length palindromes\n        len2 = expand_from_center(i, i + 1)\n        current_max = max(len1, len2)\n        if current_max > max_len:\n            max_len = current_max\n\n    return max_len\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function**: `expand_from_center` takes two pointers, `left` and `right`, and expands outwards while the characters at these pointers are equal. The function returns the length of the longest palindrome found.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string, we consider both odd and even length palindromes by calling `expand_from_center` twice: once with the same pointers for odd length and once with consecutive pointers for even length.\n3. **Track Maximum Length**: For each character, compute the maximum palindrome length found and update the overall maximum length if a longer palindrome is found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest palindromic substring with a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because each expansion from a center can take O(n) time, and we do this for each character in the string.",
