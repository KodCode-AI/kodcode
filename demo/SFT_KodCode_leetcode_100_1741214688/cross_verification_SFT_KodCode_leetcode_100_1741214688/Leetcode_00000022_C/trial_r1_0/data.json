  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest palindromic substring in a given string. Hmm, let's think about what a palindrome is. Oh right, it's a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like \"racecar\" or \"level\".\n\nSo, the function is called longest_palindrome_length, and it takes a string s as input and returns an integer. The examples provided show that for \"babad\", it's 3 because \"aba\" is the longest palindromic substring. For \"cbbd\", it's 2 because \"bb\" is the longest. For a single character like \"a\", it's 1. If the string is empty, it returns 0. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out an efficient way to check all possible substrings of the given string for palindrome properties and find the maximum length.\n\nBut wait, checking every possible substring might be time-consuming, especially for long strings. I remember that there's an approach called expand around the center which is efficient. Maybe I can use that.\n\nSo with expand around center, I treat each character as the center and expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides are equal. But wait, what about even-length palindromes? Oh right, because the center for even-length palindromes is between two characters. So perhaps I need to loop through each character and consider both odd and even lengths.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each index in the string, consider it as the center for both odd and even length palindromes.\n2. For the odd case, start with left and right pointers at that index.\n3. For the even case, set the left pointer at current index and the right at the next one.\n4. Expand around both cases and keep track of the maximum length found.\n\nHow do I keep track of the maximum length? I can have a variable max_length that starts at 0, and for each expansion, calculate the length and update max_length if it's larger.\n\nLet me think about the algorithm:\n\nInitialize max_length to 0.\n\nLoop through each index i in s:\n   Check for the longest odd-length palindrome centered at i.\n   Check for the longest even-length palindrome centered around i and i+1.\n   Update max_length each time a longer palindrome is found.\n\nFor checking the odd case:\n- left = i\n- right = i\nAnd while the characters at left and right are equal and left and right are within the string bounds, expand.\n\nSimilarly, for the even case:\n- left = i\n- right = i+1\nDo the same expansion.\n\nEach time, if the current expansion (right - left +1) is larger than max_length, update max_length.\n\nWait, but in the actual code, how do I implement that? Let's see.\n\nI can create a helper function that expands from left and right pointers and returns the length of the palindrome.\n\nWait, or perhaps just directly compute the length in the loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a function that for given left and right, expands and returns the maximum length palindrome.\n\nOk, let's try to sketch this:\n\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s):\n    max_length = 0\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # odd length\n        l, r = i, i\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            current_length = r - l + 1\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n\n        # even length\n        l, r = i, i + 1\n        while l >=0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            current_length = r - l +1\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            l -=1\n            r +=1\n\n    return max_length\n\nWait, but for the case when the string is only one character, like \"a\", this would work because in the first iteration, for both odd and even. The odd case checks (0,0), which is correct and sets max_length to 1. The even case l =0, r =1, which is beyond the string, so no change. So total is 1.\n\nAnother test case: \"ac\". i=0, for odd: finds palindrome \"a\", length 1. even: i=0, r=1, s[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'c' which aren't equal, so no. Then i=1, odd: finds 'c', length 1. even: r=2, which is beyond the string. So the max is 1.\n\nFor the case where the entire string is a palindrome, like \"ccc\", in the first loop for i=0, the odd case would expand to the whole string, with l reaching -1 and r reaching 2, etc. So the current_length becomes 3, which is the max.\n\nWait, but in the code, for \"c\", as i =0, during the odd expansion, inside the loop, current_length is set to 1. So yes.\n\nAnother test case is \"racecar\", it's a palindrome of length 7. So when i=3, the center, the expansion would keep increasing l and r as they match. For each step, current_length increases up to 7.\n\nWhat about \"banana\"? The answer is 5 because \"anana\" is the longest. Let's see: \"anana\" is 5 letters.\n\nWait, the code may capture that. Let me think: \"banana\" is 'b','a','n','a','n','a'. So when i is 2 (the middle at n?), but perhaps the expansion for 1 (the first 'a') would do better.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code correctly captures that.\n\nBut wait, let's test the code with the example \"cbbd\" which should return 2. The string is 'c','b','b','d'. The longest palindromic substring is 'bb' at indices 1 and 2. So for i=1, the even case: l=1, r=2, s[1] and s[2] are both 'b's. So current_length is 2, which becomes the max.\n\nYes, that should work. Another case is \"aaa\", the code should return 3. Let's see: for each i, the expansions would check.\n\nI=0: odd, expand to 0, then 0-1 gives for l=-1? So for as long as l and r are within bounds. So for i=0, r will expand to 2 in the odd case, checking each step.\n\nOk, it looks like this approach should handle all the test cases correctly.\n\nSo the code seems solid. So I think this is the correct approach.\n\nBut wait, in the sample tests given, for \"ac\" the output is 1. The code returns 1, which is correct.\n\nWhat about for an empty string? The loop will run n=0 times, so max_length remains 0, which is correct.\n\nThus, this code should handle all the cases.\n\nI think this is a solid plan. I'll write the code as such.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest palindromic substring in a given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. The approach we use efficiently finds the longest palindrome by expanding around potential centers for both odd and even length palindromes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Expand Around Center**: This approach treats each character and each pair of consecutive characters as potential centers of a palindrome. By expanding outwards from these centers, we can determine the longest palindromic substring.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string, consider it as the center for an odd-length palindrome. Similarly, consider each pair of consecutive characters as the center for an even-length palindrome.\n3. **Check Palindrome Validity**: For each center, expand outwards while the characters at the expanding edges are equal and within the string bounds. Track the maximum length of palindromic substrings found during these expansions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s: str) -> int:\n    max_length = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Check for odd-length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            current_length = r - l + 1\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n        \n        # Check for even-length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i + 1\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            current_length = r - l + 1\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n    \n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with `max_length` set to 0, which will store the length of the longest palindromic substring found.\n- **Iterate Through Each Character**: For each character in the string, we treat it as the center for both odd and even length palindromes.\n  - **Odd-Length Palindromes**: Expand symmetrically around the center character as long as the characters on both sides are equal.\n  - **Even-Length Palindromes**: Treat the gap between the current and next character as the center and similarly expand outwards.\n- **Update Maximum Length**: During each expansion, calculate the length of the current palindromic substring and update `max_length` if a longer palindrome is found.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible palindromic substrings by expanding around each potential center, ensuring that we find the longest one in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.",
