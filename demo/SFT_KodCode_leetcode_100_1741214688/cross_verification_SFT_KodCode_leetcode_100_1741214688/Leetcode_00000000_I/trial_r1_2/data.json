  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement a CircularQueue class with specific operations. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the constructor takes an integer k which is the maximum size. So I'll probably need an array of size k to hold the elements. But how to manage the circular nature.\n\nHmm, for a circular queue, we can use two pointers, front and rear. Wait, no, more accurately, we have a head and tail pointer. Or maybe just keep track of the front index and rear index, but the array wraps around.\n\nWait, another approach is to have a list-like structure, but with modulo operations to handle the circular part.\n\nAlternatively, an array-based approach where the front is at index 0, and when elements are dequeued, we just move the front, but when we enqueue, the rear moves forward, and wraps around when needed.\n\nWait, but maybe I can track the elements in a fixed-size array and keep track of the front and rear indices along with the count of elements. Let me outline the variables:\n\n- data: the array to store elements\n- front: the index of the first element\n- rear: the index where the next element will be placed (so current last is rear-1)\n- count: the number of elements currently in the queue\n\nSo when the queue is empty, front and rear can both be 0, and count 0. When we enqueue, we place data at rear, increment rear modulo size, and increment count. When dequeuing, we increment front modulo size and decrement count.\n\nWait, but rear is the next available position. So when you enqueue, you put data at rear, then (rear = (rear+1) % size), and count increases.\n\nSimilarly, dequeue would take data from front, then front = (front + 1) % size, count decreases.\n\nThis should handle the circular part.\n\nSo for Front() method, if the queue is empty, return -1. Otherwise, return data[front].\n\nSimilarly, Rear() returns data[(rear-1) % k], because the current last element is at the position before rear.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nSuppose the queue is empty: front = 0, rear =0, count=0.\n\nEnqueue 1: data[0] = 1, rear becomes 1, count is 1. Front is 0.\n\nRear is 1. So the last element is at index 0.\n\nOkay.\n\nEnqueue another element, say 2: data[1] = 2, rear becomes 2 mod 3 (if size 3) as 2.\n\nSo the data is [1,2].\n\nNow front is 0, rear is 2, count is 2.\n\nSo for Rear() function, we need to look at (rear - 1) mod size, which is (2-1) mod 3 = 1. data[1] is 2. Correct.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo methods:\n\nFront(): if isEmpty(), return -1. else, data[front]\n\nRear(): if isEmpty(), return -1. else, data[(rear-1) mod k]\n\nBut how to compute mod for the array index. Since rear can be zero, when you subtract 1, it might be -1. So mod k.\n\nSo (rear-1 +k ) %k ?\n\nWait, in code:\n\n(rear - 1) % k could be negative if rear is 0, which would make (rear-1) = -1 mod k.\n\nBut in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers, but has a different result than some other languages. So (rear-1) %k if rear can be zero, that gives k-1, which is correct.\n\nWait, when rear is 0, (0-1) is -1. -1 mod k is k-1. So if the array is not empty, that's the position right before rear, which wraps around correctly.\n\nSo Rear function can be implemented that way.\n\nThen for enQueue:\n\nCheck if the queue is full. If isFull() returns true, which is when count == k. Because how else? Since size is k, and count is the current elements.\n\nSo in enQueue:\n\nif isFull: return False\n\nelse:\n\ndata[rear] = value\n\nrear = (rear+1) % k\n\ncount +=1\n\nreturn True\n\nFor deQueue:\n\nif isEmpty() return False\n\nelse:\n\nfront = (front +1 ) %k\n\ncount -=1\n\nreturn True\n\nWait, but what's the oldest element when we dequeue? In a queue, it's FIFO. So the front is the first element. When we dequeue, we just remove it by moving front.\n\nWait, but for implementation, since the array is fixed, we don't need to shift elements. So we just increment front.\n\nSo for methods, the steps are:\n\nFront():\nif count is 0: return -1\nelse: return data[front]\n\nRear():\nif count is 0: return -1\nelse: return data[(rear-1) %k]\n\nenQueue:\nif count ==k: return False\nelse:\ndata[rear] = value\nrear = (rear+1) %k\ncount +=1\nreturn True\n\ndeQueue:\nif count ==0: return False\nelse:\ncount -=1\nfront = (front +1) %k\nreturn True\n\nNow, what about the isEmpty and isFull methods?\n\nisEmpty returns count ==0\n\nisFull returns count ==k\n\nWait, count increases when you enqueue, and we only enqueue when count <k. So when enqueue is possible, count will only reach k after.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- data array, size k\n\n- front: starts at 0\n\n- rear: starts at 0\n\n- count: starts at 0\n\nWait, but when the queue is full, data is filled from front to (front + count -1) mod k?\n\nNo, data is filled from front to ... Actually, in our model, the queue is a contiguous block of count elements starting from front and wrapping around.\n\nWait, perhaps. So the elements are front, front+1, ..., front + (count-1). But mod k, since it's circular.\n\nBut for our implementation, I don't need to track them all, as I just need to know count.\n\nWhen Front is called, it points to the front index.\n\nNow, what about when the array is size k=0? Wait, no, the constructor takes k as maximum size, so it should be at least 1? Or wait, the problem says 'k' is the size, but what about when someone calls with k=0? Probably, the code will not handle that, so maybe the constructor should throw an error if k <=0.\n\nWait, the problem says the function is 'int k' as the maximum size.\n\nProbably, in the problem, the code can assume that k is a positive integer.\n\nWait, the constructor requires that, but maybe we should handle the case so that if k is zero, perhaps it's an empty queue and can't hold anything.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the code is correct for k >=1.\n\nSo I'll proceed under the assumption that the CircularQueue with, say, size zero may not be required, but the constructor may have to take 0 as possible.\n\nWait, in the constructor, when k is zero, what should happen? Maybe for this problem, it's undefined or maybe the code will just set up a data array with zero elements, thus the queue is always empty. So any enQueue will fail, and deQueue will also fail.\n\nWell, perhaps the problem expects that k is a positive integer. But the code should handle k=0 as a possible case.\n\nSo perhaps in the constructor, no error is thrown, but just proceeds.\n\nSo, in the code, rear and front can be initialized to zero. Wait, but if the data array is zero, front and rear may have issues. But perhaps in the code, for k=0, data is an empty array.\n\nBut when k=0, every enQueue will return false because when k=0 is passed, the initially count is zero.\n\nWait, in enQueue(), the function returns False if the queue is full (count ==k). If k is 0, and data is empty, then count 0 == 0, so isFull is True. So enQueue() returns False for any k=0 and any count (but maybe only after initial). Wait, the queue is constructed with k=0, count=0. Then, calling enQueue() should always return false, as enQueue only returns true if it can add, but since k is 0, it's full initially, as 0 ==0.\n\nWait, yeah, to enqueue, count must be < k.\n\nWait okay, that logic works. So the code is safe.\n\nNow, thinking about all methods.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nWait, Python lists can be used for the data array.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nIn __init__:\n\n- self.k = k (the maximum size)\n\n- self.data = [0] * k\n\n- self.front =0\n\n- self.rear =0\n\n- self.count=0\n\nWait, but if k is zero, data would be [0]*0 which is an empty list. Then self.data is empty.\n\nBut since k can be zero, we need to handle that.\n\nSo in enQueue, if k is zero, return False.\n\nSimilarly, deQueue() can only be called if count>0.\n\nNow, the Front and Rear functions.\n\nFront() function:\n\nif self.isEmpty(), return -1 else return data[front]\n\nBut in cases where k is zero, data is an empty list. So, if self.count>0, but data is empty? No, because data's size is k. So if k is zero, data can't have any elements.\n\nSo in any case, when count is non-zero, data is being accessed correctly.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nImplement methods:\n\nisEmpty is return self.count ==0.\n\nisFull: return self.count ==self.k.\n\nFront:\n\nif count==0: return -1\n\nelse: return self.data[self.front]\n\nRear:\n\nif count ==0: return -1\n\nelse: return self.data[(self.rear -1) % self.k]\n\nWait, but what about when k is 1? If rear is 0, then (0-1) is -1, mod 1 is 0. So data[0] is correct, as it would have the only element.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nenQueue:\n\nif self.count == self.k: return False\n\nelse:\n\nself.data[self.rear] = value\n\nself.rear = (self.rear +1) % self.k\n\nself.count +=1\n\nreturn True\n\ndeQueue:\n\nif self.isEmpty(): return False\n\nelse:\n\nself.count -=1\n\nself.front = (self.front +1) % self.k\n\nreturn True\n\nTesting these functions.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTest Case 1: k=3.\n\nEnqueue 1: data becomes [1,0,0], rear becomes 1, count 1.\n\nEnqueue 2: data [1,2,0], rear 2, count 2.\n\nEnqueue 3: data [1,2,3], rear 0, count 3.\n\nNow, Rear() is data[ (0-1) mod3 ] = data[2], since mod 3 returns 2. Data[2] is 3.\n\nFront is 0: 1.\n\nDequeue: count becomes 2, front becomes 1.\n\nNow Rear() is (0-1) mod3 = 2.\n\nFront is data[1] =2.\n\nAnother dequeue: count 1, front 2.\n\nRear() is data[2], because (0-1 +3) mod3 is 2+3-1= 2 mod3 is 2. So data[2] is 3. Or wait, wait, after enQueue's, rear is 0, so rear=0 +1 =1 (after enqueue 3) so after enqueue, it was set.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nWait, when I enqueued up to 3, the rear became 0, through (2+1) mod3 =0.\n\nSo Rear() is (0-1) mod3=2. data[2]=3, correct.\n\nAfter dequeuing once:\n\nfront increments to (0+1) mod3=1. data[1] is 2.\n\nBut the rear is still 0.\n\nSo Rear is (0-1) mod3=2. data[2]=3 still.\n\nSo Rear() returns 3.\n\nDequeued again: front becomes 2.\n\nSo dequeuing 2.\n\nNow counts is 1.\n\nFront is 2.\n\nRear is 0.\n\nBut after dequeuing, does the rear stay as 0? Because enQueue adds to rear and then updates it.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, Rear() is data[ (0-1) mod3] = data[2] = 3. Because the only remaining element is 3, which is data[2].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, trying to enqueue another element when count is 1, since k=3.\n\nenQueue(4) will check if count ==3 (which is 1 <3). So adds 4 at rear=0.\n\ncount becomes 2.\n\nNow data is [4,2,3]. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the enQueue(4) step:\n\nSelf.rear is 0.\n\ndata[0] is set to4.\n\nThen rear becomes (0+1) mod3=1.\n\nCount becomes 2.\n\nSo data is [4,2,3].\n\nNow, front is 2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because after two dequeues, the front was at 2.\n\nSo data[2] is the first element.\n\nBut after enQueueing 4 at rear=0.\n\nSo the queue contains data[2] (element 3), and then data[0] (element4).\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but the count is 2. So the queue elements are 3,4.\n\nWait, but the front is at 2, which is the index of 3.\n\nRear is at 1, which will be next position for enqueuing.\n\nSo now, when you enqueue another element, it will go to index1, which is current data[1]=2. But when enqueued, if current data is [4,2,3], is that correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWhen we enqueued 4, data[0] is 4, then rear is 1.\n\nSo now, data is [4,0,3], right? Or wait, after two dequeues, what is the state.\n\nWait, after initial state:\n\ndata is [1,2,3], front=0, rear=0, count=3.\n\nDequeue once: front=1, count 2, data [1,2,3].\n\nWait, but I'm probably treating the data as a collection of all elements, but in reality, count is the current number of elements, not the entire array.\n\nWait, when k=3, the data array has 3 elements, but when count is 2, then data holds some elements, and the actual queue uses front and rear to track which are valid.\n\nBut in Python, the array is of size k, so it can't handle more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps in the way it's being tracked, the enqueued data overwrites older data. Because when front is beyond the initial elements, and the queue is being re-used.\n\nWait, maybe not\u2014this is a possible bug.\n\nWait, but if you have a queue that enqueues beyond its initial elements, then data could have overwritten elements that may not be part of the current queue.\n\nThis is a potential problem. How?\n\nLet me think: when the queue is full (count ==k), then an enqueue returns false.\n\nBut when not full, enqueues proceed.\n\nSo for example, after the initial queue has three elements, when two are dequeued, the data array is [1,2,3], front=2, count 2 (but wait, after two dequeues, front is 0 again? Or no. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, initial enqueues:\n\nqueue is empty, then 1,2,3 are enqueued. front is 0, rear is 0.\n\ncount is 3.\n\nThen, two dequeues: each increment front.\n\nFirst dequeue: front becomes 1, count 2.\n\nSecond dequeue: front becomes 2, count 1.\n\nSo data[0] is 1, data[1] is 2, data[2] is3.\n\nThen, trying to enqueue 4: isFull? No, because count is 1, which is less than 3.\n\nso enqueue 4 at rear=0.\n\nso data becomes [4,2,3].\n\nrear becomes 1.\n\ncount 2.\n\nSo front is 2.\n\nSo the queue now has elements: 3 and 4? Or 4?\n\nWait, the count is 2.\n\nfront is 2. So when you retrieve Front(), it returns data[2] which is 3.\n\nFor Rear(), (1 -1 =0) mod3=0. data[0] is4.\n\nSo the queue contains 3 and 4, in that order.\n\nAnother enQueue: 5.\n\nCheck if count is 2 <3, so yes.\n\nQueue 5 at rear=1. data[1] is5.\n\ncount 3.\n\nfront=2.\n\nrear now 2.\n\nSo data is [4,5,3].\n\nThe queue's Front is data[2]=3, Rear is (2-1)=1: data[1] =5.\n\nAnd the queue has elements 3,4,5.\n\nSo enQueueing again: returns False.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo in this case, the data structure allows the queue to wrap around, but because the data array is maintained, the elements are correctly accessed.\n\nBut wait, the data array is filled with elements that may include 'stale' data. But as long as we correctly manage front, rear, and count, it's fine because when the count is n, the elements are (front, front+1 modk,...front +n-1 modk), but wait, no. Because new enqueues can overwrite old elements.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because enQueue overwrites the current position of rear, which, once incremented, is not used until the next enQueue.\n\nSo data may have leftover junk if elements are being enqueued in a way that the same data indexes are being used after being dequeued.\n\nBut in reality, the code's Front and Rear methods just access the elements that are part of the current queue.\n\nSo in the above example, data[0] is4, data[1] =5, data[2] =3.\n\nAnd front is2, count is3.\n\nSo the \u961f\u5217 contains data[2], data[0], data[1]. Or wait, the way the code manages the queue doesn't hold elements in the array in the order like that. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps visualizes as data is [4,5,3], front=2, count=3. So Rear method returns data[1], which is5.\n\nSo when you dequeue, the front increments and count decreases.\n\nBut in code, the data is not actually moved, just the pointers.\n\nSo the queue elements are data[front], data[front+1 mod3], etc.\n\nBut wait, after dequeue.\n\nWait, dequeueing when count is3:\n\nfront is2, count 3. That's the condition of a full queue. So you cannot enqueue.\n\nWait, perhaps my tests are causing confusion.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps in the code, when you enQueue, you replace the data at rear, which may be empty or may overwrite dequeued elements.\n\nBut in the problem's context, as long as Front and Rear give the correct elements, how the data is stored in the array is irrelevant.\n\nSo the model is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nTest Case 2:\n\nCreate a CircularQueue of size 2.\n\nEnqueue 1: count=1, rear=1.\n\nFront is0.\n\nEnqueue2: count=2, rear=0.\n\nAt this point, isFull() is True. So enQueue returns False for next step.\n\nNow, Front() returns1, Rear() returns data[0-1 mod2] = data[1] =2.\n\nDequeue once: front becomes0+1=1 mod2=1. count=1.\n\nDequeue again: front becomes2 mod2=0. count=0.\n\nQueue is empty.\n\nEnqueue again: 3, as queue is empty. So rear is0.\n\nNow, data is [3,2]. front is0 (since after two dequeues, count was 0, so front is reset to 0? Or no, wait:\n\nWait, the front is the index where the next dequeue will take data.\n\nSo after two dequeues on the queue with size 2:\n\nInitial: data is [1,2], front=0, count=2.\n\nDequeue once: count is1, front is1.\n\nDequeue again: count is0, front is 2 mod2=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, enqueuing 3.\n\ndata[0] is3. rear=1.\n\ncount1.\n\nSo, Front returns3.\n\nRear returns data[0 mod1]?\n\nWait, Rear is data[ (1-1)mod2 ] = data[0] =3.\n\nBut the queue has only 3.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother enQueue (val=4):\n\ncan it be enqueued?\n\ncount is1 <2. So yes.\n\ndata[1] becomes4.\n\nrear becomes (1+1) mod2=0.\n\ncount=2.\n\nFront is0: data[0] is3.\n\nRear is data[0-1= -1 mod2=1], data[1]=4.\n\nYes.\n\nso after enqueueing 4, the data is [3,4].\n\nDequeueing once:\n\ncount1, front becomes0+1=1.\n\nSo Front() is data[1] =4.\n\nRear is data[ (0-1)mod2 ]=data[1]=4.\n\nAnother dequeue:\n\ncount0, front becomes 2 mod2=0.\n\nNow, queue is empty.\n\nYes.\n\nSo it seems the model works.\n\nSo what about when size is zero?\n\nTest Case 3:\n\nsize is zero.\n\nenQueue any value: returns False, as k is zero, count is zero.\n\nCall Front: returns -1.\n\nCall Rear: -1.\n\ndeQueue: False.\n\nisEmpty: True.\n\nisFull: True (since count ==k =0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo how to handle that.\n\nIn code:\n\nif k is zero, data is initialized as empty list, so any index access will be invalid. So in the Front and Rear functions, we must ensure that in case k=0, data can't be accessed. But in Front and Rear, if count is 0, which would be the case since k=0, we return -1. So no access to data occurs in that case.\n\nSo, code should be safe.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python:\n\nImplement the CircularQueue class with:\n\n- __init__(self, k)\n\n- Front()\n\n- Rear()\n\n- enQueue(value)\n\n- deQueue()\n\n- isEmpty()\n\n- isFull()\n\nImplementing each.\n\nWait, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, construct:\n\nclass CircularQueue:\n\n    def __init__(self, k):\n\n        self.k = k\n\n        self.data = [None] * k  # or handle for k=0?\n\n        self.front = 0\n\n        self.rear = 0\n\n        self.count = 0\n\nWait, for k=0, [None]*0 is empty list.\n\nSo for enQueue:\n\ndef enQueue(self, value):\n\n        if self.count == self.k:\n\n            return False\n\n        self.data[self.rear] = value\n\n        self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.k\n\n        self.count +=1\n\n        return True\n\nBut, when k=0, self.rear is mod 0? Wait, modulo zero is undefined and will cause error.\n\nSo in __init__, if k is zero, what? Because if k is zero, then modulo is division by zero.\n\nSo we need to handle k=0 as a special case.\n\nWait, when you create a CircularQueue with k=0, it's a queue that can hold 0 elements.\n\nSo the enQueue, deQueue, Front, Rear all should return appropriate values.\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nIf k=0, then any operation that requires modulo with self.k would crash.\n\nSo in the code, for functions like enQueue, deQueue, which have (rear = (rear +1) %k), when k=0, it's an error.\n\nSo we need to handle k=0 in the __init__, and set variables that can avoid such divisions.\n\nBut perhaps, for this problem, the test cases avoid k=0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in __init__, if k <=0, we can treat the queue as having size 0, which is an invalid queue, and all operations return failure.\n\nBut the problem says in the constructor that k is the maximum size, implying it's a capacity. So perhaps, it should be allowed, but logically, it can only hold zero elements.\n\nSo, in code, when k <=0:\n\n- data is empty\n\n- enQueue always returns False.\n\n- deQueue always returns False.\n\ncount ==0 always.\n\nSo in __init__:\n\nif k is zero, set k=0, data is empty, front and rear can be anything.\n\nModify __init__:\n\ndef __init__(self, k):\n\n    if k <=0:\n\n        self.k = 0\n\n        self.data = []\n\n        self.front = 0\n\n        self.rear =0\n\n        self.count =0\n\n    else:\n\n        self.k = k\n\n        self.data = [None]*k\n\n        self.front=0\n\n        self.rear=0\n\n        self.count=0\n\nSo now, when k is zero, enQueue, deQueue will return False, and Front and Rear return -1.\n\nThus, with that, the code is safe.\n\nSo now, write the rest of the code.\n\nFor Front:\n\ndef Front(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty():\n\n        return -1\n\n    return self.data[self.front]\n\nFor Rear:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty():\n\n        return -1\n\n    return self.data[(self.rear-1) % self.k]\n\nBut wait, for k=0, in Rear(), (self.rear-1) is 0-1= -1, (mod 0) would cause division by zero error.\n\nThus, when k=0, we should not compute (self.rear-1) % self.k.\n\nSo in Rear():\n\nif self.count ==0 or k ==0:\n\n    return -1.\n\nThus, for Rear:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty() or self.k ==0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    return self.data[ (self.rear-1) % self.k ]\n\nWait, because when k is zero, the Rear() should always return -1, since the queue is always empty.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut perhaps, we can make code modifications:\n\nInside Rear(), get the value only when the queue is not empty.\n\nThus:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty():\n\n        return -1\n\n    if self.k ==0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    index = (self.rear -1) % self.k\n\n    return self.data[index]\n\nBut again, in the case of k=0, code returns -1, because Rear checks count ==0.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nAnother way: in Rear() and Front(), after the isEmpty() check, proceed. So for k=0, the isEmpty() is always true, so returns -1, and doesn't crash.\n\nSo perhaps no changes are needed.\n\nBut to make sure:\n\nIn Python:\n\nWhen you have x = a % 0, it throws a ZeroDivisionError.\n\nSo, in Rear(), when k=0 and Rear is called and count is 0, returns -1, correct.\n\nBut in the case of k=0 and a count>0, but empty. But for k=0, count is always zero.\n\nThus, in Rear(), the code can safely be:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty() or self.k ==0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    return self.data[ (self.rear-1) % self.k ]\n\nYes, perhaps it's better to have the self.k ==0 check.\n\nBut perhaps not, because in the case of k=0, is isFull returns True when count is 0, and isFull when k>0 is count ==k.\n\nWait, but in any case, for k=0, the queue is treated as empty.\n\nSo the code should be written accordingly.\n\nBut to prevent the mod zero error, probably, in Rear, we need to handle k=0 first.\n\nThus, in code:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty() or self.k ==0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    index = (self.rear -1) % self.k\n\n    return self.data[index]\n\nSimilarly, in Front(), for k=0:\n\ndef Front(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty() or self.k ==0:\n\n        return -1\n\n    return self.data[self.front]\n\nBut again, for k=0, code returns -1.\n\nBut perhaps it's unnecessary, because when k=0 and self.isEmpty is True, and it's first condition.\n\nBut to prevent any ZeroDivisionError, the extra condition is better.\n\nBut perhaps it's safe, because when k=0, the queue is treated as empty.\n\nBut, when you have:\n\n(self.rear-1) % self.k, when self.k is 0: it causes zero division.\n\nSo in Rear(), when k=0 and the queue is empty (count==0), then that code is avoided.\n\nBut, alternatively, if count is zero, Rear() returns -1 before.\n\nSo isn't it sufficient.\n\nYes.\n\nBecause, when queue is empty, regardless of k, Rear() returns -1.\n\nIf k=0 but count is zero (which it must be), then Fount returns-1, same with Rear.\n\nBut wait, no: when k=0, count is always zero.\n\nBut for Rear, when k=0, if the queue is not empty, which it can't be, because for k=0, data is empty.\n\nThus, Rear() can safely return -1 if isEmpty is True.\n\nBut in Rear(), when the queue is not empty, but k is zero, if any code path reaches that, which is not possible.\n\nThus, perhaps the code is safe.\n\nIn any case, the code will not crash because when k=0 and count==0, Rear() returns -1.\n\nThus, the code for Rear is:\n\ndef Rear(self):\n\n    if self.isEmpty():\n\n        return -1\n\n    index = (self.rear -1) % self.k\n\n    return self.data[index]\n\nBut when k=0, if (self.rear -1) is -1, mod 0: division by zero error.\n\nThus, for k=0.\n\nWait, but no, because if k=0, the queue is always empty (as count is zero).\n\nThus, when Rear() is called:\n\nif self.isEmpty():\n\n    return -1\n\nso the rest is not executed.\n\nThus, code is safe.\n\nBut in code, the Rerar function has to compute (self.rear -1) %k. So when k=0, but in the case when self.isEmpty is False, but for k=0, the isEmpty is False is impossible.\n\nThus, the code is safe.\n\nAnother test: for k=1.\n\nenqueue 1 => count is1, rear is 0+1 mod1=0.\n\nFront is1.\n\nRear is0-1 mod1= -1 mod1= 0?\n\nNo, (rear-1) is0-1 is-1. mod1 is0.\n\nThus, data[0], which is correct.\n\nNow, after deQueue:\n\ncount is0, front is (0+1) mod1=0.\n\nSo it's now empty.\n\nThus, all valid.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nImplement the class as described.\n\nSo the code:\n\nclass CircularQueue:\n\n    def __init__(self, k):\n\n        self.k = k\n\n        if self.k <=0:\n\n            self.data = []  # empty for k=0\n\n            self.front = 0\n\n            self.rear = 0\n\n            self.count =0\n\n        else:\n\n            self.data = [None] * self.k\n\n            self.front =0\n\n            self.rear =0\n\n            self.count=0\n\n    def Front(self):\n\n        if self.isEmpty():\n\n            return -1\n\n        return self.data[self.front]\n\n    def Rear(self):\n\n        if self.isEmpty():\n\n            return -1\n\n        index = (self.rear -1) % self.k\n\n        return self.data[index]\n\n    def enQueue(self, value):\n\n        if self.isFull():\n\n            return False\n\n        self.data[self.rear] = value\n\n        self.rear = (self.rear +1 ) % self.k\n\n        self.count +=1\n\n        return True\n\n    def deQueue(self):\n\n        if self.isEmpty():\n\n            return False\n\n        self.count -=1\n\n        self.front = (self.front +1 ) % self.k\n\n        return True\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n\n        return self.count ==0\n\n    def isFull(self):\n\n        return self.count == self.k\n\nThus, https://code.dcoder.tech/problem.php?ID=1263&Intersection=1\n\nYes, this should fulfill all requirements.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a Circular Queue data structure that supports several operations efficiently. The operations include enqueueing elements, dequeueing elements, checking the front and rear elements, and checking if the queue is empty or full. All operations should be performed in constant time (O(1)).\n\n### Approach\nThe Circular Queue is implemented using an array-based approach with two pointers, `front` and `rear`, to keep track of the current front and rear of the queue. The queue wraps around using modulo operations to handle the circular nature. Here's the detailed approach:\n\n1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:\n   - The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum size `k`. If `k` is zero or negative, the queue is initialized as empty.\n\n2. **Enqueue (`enQueue` method)**:\n   - Adds an element to the rear of the queue. If the queue is full, it returns `False`.\n   - The rear pointer is incremented modulo `k` to handle the circular wrap-around.\n\n3. **Dequeue (`deQueue` method)**:\n   - Removes the element at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns `False`.\n   - The front pointer is incremented modulo `k` to handle the circular wrap-around.\n\n4. **Front (`Front` method)**:\n   - Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `-1`.\n\n5. **Rear (`Rear` method)**:\n   - Returns the element at the rear of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `-1`.\n\n6. **Empty Check (`isEmpty` method)**:\n   - Returns `True` if the queue is empty, otherwise `False`.\n\n7. **Full Check (`isFull` method)**:\n   - Returns `True` if the queue is full, otherwise `False`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass CircularQueue:\n    def __init__(self, k):\n        self.k = k\n        if self.k <= 0:\n            self.data = []\n            self.front = 0\n            self.rear = 0\n            self.count = 0\n        else:\n            self.data = [None] * self.k\n            self.front = 0\n            self.rear = 0\n            self.count = 0\n\n    def Front(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        return self.data[self.front]\n\n    def Rear(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return -1\n        index = (self.rear - 1) % self.k\n        return self.data[index]\n\n    def enQueue(self, value):\n        if self.isFull():\n            return False\n        self.data[self.rear] = value\n        self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.k\n        self.count += 1\n        return True\n\n    def deQueue(self):\n        if self.isEmpty():\n            return False\n        self.count -= 1\n        self.front = (self.front + 1) % self.k\n        return True\n\n    def isEmpty(self):\n        return self.count == 0\n\n    def isFull(self):\n        return self.count == self.k\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The queue is initialized with a fixed size `k`. If `k` is zero or negative, the queue is treated as always empty.\n- **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the next available position at the rear. If the queue is full, it returns `False`.\n- **Dequeue**: Removes the element at the front. If the queue is empty, it returns `False`.\n- **Front**: Returns the front element without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `-1`.\n- **Rear**: Returns the rear element without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns `-1`.\n- **Empty Check**: Checks if the queue has no elements.\n- **Full Check**: Checks if the queue is at its maximum capacity.\n\nThis approach ensures that all operations are performed in constant time, O(1), by efficiently managing the indices using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the queue.",
