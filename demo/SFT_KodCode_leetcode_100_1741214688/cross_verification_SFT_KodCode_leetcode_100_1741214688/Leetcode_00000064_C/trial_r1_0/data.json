  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to implement two functions for a binary search tree. The first function is find_in_bst, which searches for a target value and returns a boolean. The second one is insert_in_bst, which inserts a new node into the BST.\n\nLet's start with the find_in_bst function. I remember that in a binary search tree, each node's left child has a smaller value and the right child has a larger value than the node itself. So, the search should follow this property.\n\nSo, the base case would be when the root is null. In that case, the target is not present, so return False. Otherwise, if the target is equal to the root's value, return True.\n\nIf the target is less than the root's value, then we should search the left subtree. If the target is greater, we search the right subtree. Wait, but how do I structure this? Do I do it recursively?\n\nYes, recursion would be straightforward. So the function would check the current node's value and decide which subtree to explore next.\n\nWait, but what if the tree is empty? Oh, right, the first thing to check is if root is None. Then return False because there's nothing to search.\n\nSo the steps for find_in_bst are:\n\n1. If root is None, return False.\n2. If target is equal to root.val, return True.\n3. Else, if target is less than root.val, recursively search the left subtree.\n4. If target is greater, search the right subtree.\n\nThat should cover all cases.\n\nNow, moving on to the insert_in_bst function. I need to add a new node with the given value in the correct position in the BST. Again, using the BST properties to find where to insert.\n\nFirst, if the tree is empty, i.e., root is None, create a new node and return it.\n\nOtherwise, compare the value to the current root's value. If the value is less, move to the left child. If greater, move to the right.\n\nBut since we're inserting, we need to go as far as possible. So when we hit a null, insert the new node there.\n\nWait, but how do I handle cases where the tree structure might not be perfect? Like, not all insertions are just appending to the right or left. So I need to traverse the tree until I find the correct spot.\n\nAlternatively, I can implement this recursively as well. The function could return the new root after insertion.\n\nBut wait, how does recursion work here? Let's think:\n\nThe function takes root and val. It checks if root is None, in which case a new node is created and returned. Else, if val is less than root's value, the left child is the result of insert_in_bst called on the left child. Similarly, if val is greater, the right child is the result.\n\nAfter inserting, I should assign the returned node back to the left or right. But wait, what if val is equal to root's value? In a standard BST, we usually don't allow duplicates. Do I handle that? The function's description doesn't say, so I should probably just ignore inserting duplicates by not adding them if the value exists.\n\nSo, in the insert function:\n\n1. Check if root is None. If yes, create a new TreeNode with val, and return it.\n2. Else, compare val with root.val.\n3. If val is less than root.val, recursively call insert_in_bst on root.left, then assign that result to root.left.\n4. If val is greater, do the same on root.right.\n5. If val equals root.val, perhaps do nothing, as we don't want duplicates.\n6. Finally, return the root node.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the val is equal, the recursion would happen until root is null, then create a new node. But if the function only creates a new node when root is null, but if the path leads to where the value exists, it might not drop a new node.\n\nWait, no: let's see.\n\nSuppose the target is already present. Then, during the insertion process, the function will reach the node with val equal to the target, and since in the condition, it will check for val > root.val, but only proceeds if it's not equal. No, wait no.\n\nWait, the function will have:\n\nif root.val is None:\n\nbut then the else statement will compare. Wait, in the initial condition, the root is not None. Let me think.\n\nI think I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the steps.\n\nFunction insert_in_bst(root, val):\n\n- if root is None:\n    create a new TreeNode with val, return it.\n- else if val < root.val:\n    set root's left child to be the result of recursively calling insert on the left child, passing val.\n- else if val > root.val:\n    set root's right child to be the result of recursively calling insert on the right child, passing val.\n- else:\n    do nothing (since val is equal to root.val, no duplicate insertion)\n- return root.\n\nBut wait, when inserting, how does the recursion build the tree correctly?\n\nLet me take an example.\n\nSuppose the root is 5, and I'm inserting 3.\n\nThe function will see that 3 < 5. So it would recursively call insert_in_bst on root.left (which is None in this case). So, it creates a new node and returns it, which is then assigned to root.left.\n\nAnother example: inserting 8 into a root with 5, right is 7. When comparing 8>5, the function looks to the right. Then, 8>7, so insert onto root.right.right. Since that is None, it creates 8, assigns it.\n\nBut what if during insertion, the value is equal to an existing node? Let's say we try to insert 5 again. So root is 5, and val is 5. So else if val > root.val would be false. So function does nothing except returns root. So the new node isn't inserted.\n\nThat seems correct if we don't want duplicates.\n\nBut what if the BST allows duplicates? Like, maybe allowing them in the left or right.\n\nHmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify. The function says \"insert a new node\", so perhaps we should handle duplicates, but perhaps by inserting them either on the left or right side.\n\nIf we have to handle duplication, perhaps the logic needs to be adjusted. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the standard approach is to not insert duplicates, so the function should handle that. Alternatively, perhaps the function can allow duplicates by specifying a certain side. But since the problem says 'inserts a new node with given value', and in the find function, any occurrence would lead to return True, it's better to think about that.\n\nWait, perhaps the insert function can simply add the node regardless, but if the value exists on the left, it will be placed further left of the existing node, or if on the right, further right.\n\nWait no, because in a BST, duplicates (multiple nodes with the same value) can be inserted but should follow the BST property. For example, in some implementations, duplicates are allowed, but they have to be in the left or right subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to, when inserting, if the value is equal, it can go into the left or the right. But perhaps the problem expects that duplicates are allowed.\n\nHmm, but the problem's function is to 'insert a new node into the BST'\u2014so the BST after insertion should satisfy the BST property, but where duplication is allowed. So perhaps the approach is to when target is found, just return (meaning we don't insert), but the problem states that it should insert a new node. So perhaps the problem expects that the value is inserted even if it's present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should handle that insertion, but I'm not sure.\n\nWell, the function's docstring is to insert a new node with the given val. So even if the value exists, perhaps the function should create a new node.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused about whether the BST can have duplicate val.\n\nIf duplication is allowed, then during insertion, when the val is equal to root's val, which direction to go?\n\nOne possible approach is to insert duplicates to the left (or to the right, but traditionally, some BST implementations do this). So, in our function, if val is equal, when inserting, maybe go left.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, since the function is called 'insert_in_bst' without specification, it's better to not allow duplicates, or maybe the problem expects that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the insert_in_bst should allow duplicates. Because, for instance, in some BSTs, including in the function, duplicates are allowed in the left.\n\nBut given that the find_in_bst function returns True if the val is present, inserting again may not be necessary for the BST's correctness, but perhaps the function is supposed to make sure that the node is inserted regardless.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the BST allows duplicates or not. So perhaps the function's implementation needs to handle only the case when the tree doesn't allow duplicates. So, in that scenario, the function should return True or False if the value is found, and do not insert during insert_in_bst.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function insert_in_bst is supposed to insert the node regardless of whether the value exists or not.\n\nHmm. Wait, let's look at the function definitions:\n\nThe find_in_bst returns True or False based on whether the target is present. The insert_in_bst is supposed to insert a new node.\n\nTherefore, during insertion, even if the target is already present, the function should create and insert a new node. Because, for example, if the tree allows multiple nodes with the same value, find would still return True.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for that.\n\nBut in that case, how?\n\nWait, let's model the insert function.\n\nIn the insert_in_bst function, should it always insert a new node with the val, even if the val already exists in the tree?\n\nIf yes, then during insertion, the function will proceed to the path where the node with the same value is found, and add the new node as either left or right child, depending on where it can fit.\n\nWait, but in a BST, nodes should not have duplicates. So that's why perhaps inserting is only when the val is not present.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects that the insert_in_bst function always inserts a new node with the given val into the BST, which may or may not already contain that val.\n\nSo in that case, the function would proceed to add the node in the appropriate position, possibly leading to duplicates.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about the insert_in_bst function's behavior.\n\nIn the functions:\n\n- When the root is null: insert the node.\n\n- Else, if val is less than root.val: insert into left subtree.\n\n- Else, insert into right subtree.\n\nSo, when val is equal to root.val, it would go to the right. Or maybe some other condition.\n\nWait, this is incorrect. If I proceed to val > root.val, it would go to the right subtree. But if the current root's val is equal, perhaps in the code, it would go to the right, but that depends on the code.\n\nNo, the code's condition would be something like:\n\nif val > current.val:\n    go right\nelse:\n    go left\n\nWait no, to preserve the BST property when inserting, the insertion should follow the BST rules.\n\nSo, if the val is less than root's val, go to left.\n\nElse, go to right.\n\nIn this case, when the val is equal, it is considered 'else' part and would go right.\n\nBut this would allow multiple insertions of the same value, as each subsequent insertion would create a new node further in the right.\n\nBut this would cause duplicates but the BST property would be maintained.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the else part is if val is less than or equal. No, in that case, in a BST, that would cause a binary search tree to have all nodes in one direction, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is that in the insert function, each insertion is done such that, if the target value is found, when moving left or right, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if val is less than or equal to node val, insert left. Which would cause duplicates to be inserted on the left. Or perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, in a standard BST, the root is greater than left, less than right, and all nodes in left subtree are less than root, and right are greater than root. So, if the value is equal, it doesn't fit left or right. So, in the case of insert, perhaps it's proper to not insert, if the value exists.\n\nBut this is not possible, because the insert_in_bst is supposed to insert a new node. So I'm getting stuck here.\n\nHmm, perhaps given that the problem says to 'insert a new node', perhaps the function can allow inserting. Hence, the logic for insert_in_bst is to insert even if the same value exists.\n\nSo, in such a case, the insert_in_bst function would proceed as:\n\nif val < current.val: insert into left subtree.\n\nelse: insert into right subtree.\n\nSo, even if this causes multiple nodes with val, which is allowed.\n\nIn this case, the function would allow inserting, but during find_in_bst, the function would return True the first time it finds the value, even if there are multiple.\n\nBut perhaps in the BST, it's better to not allow duplicates, and in the insert function, avoid duplication.\n\nBut given that the function says to insert new node, perhaps it's correct to create a new node each time.\n\nBut without more information, perhaps it's better to implement the insert_in_bst following the standard BST insertion rules, which don't allow duplicates. So, if a node with the same value exists, the insertion doesn't happen.\n\nBut how to manage that? Because in the function, we have to return a new TreeNode or assign the existing node.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the insert function, it simply creates the node when it reaches a null. Because during traversal, if the path requires going to the left or right, and that node is null, the new node is created.\n\nSo for example, when trying to insert a duplicate, when the function reaches the target node, if the target is equal, it would check where to go. For example, if the target is equal to root, then if root.left is null, it will return a new node, but wait, that would create a left child with same val.\n\nWait, no. Because when val is equal, the code will choose to either go left or right, but the question is which direction.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code.\n\nLet's draft the insert function:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nSo, according to this code:\n\n- if val is less than root.val: insert left.\n\n- else: insert right (including when val == root.val, which would go to the right).\n\nWait, so if the value is equal, it's inserted into the right subtree. Which would allow multiple insertions of the same value, creating multiple nodes that are to the right of the same node.\n\nWait, for instance:\n\nInserting 5 at the root.\n\nInserting a new 5 into the right of 5.\n\nInserting another 5 in the right of the first 5's right.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the tree could have multiple nodes with the same value, all on the right side.\n\nHmm, is that an issue? Well, according to BST properties, no: because for each node, all left nodes have values less than the node's value, and all right nodes have values greater than the node's value. But this would result in a node where its right subtree can have a node with the same value. That violates BST properties.\n\nThus, allowing duplicates in this way is not permitted, as the BST property could be broken.\n\nWait, no. Because in the insertion step, when you have a parent node, and you're putting children in the right subtree, each child must be greater than the parent.\n\nWait, but when val is equal to the parent, in the code above, it goes to the right. So the right child would have a val equal to the parent. So that would violate the BST property, as all right descendants should be greater than the parent.\n\nSo in that case, the code's logic is incorrect, because when val is equal to the root.val, the insertion into the right subtree would create a node that doesn't satisfy the BST property.\n\nSo this is a problem.\n\nSo, in this case, the insert_in_bst function needs to avoid inserting duplicates. So, during insertion, if a node already exists with the same value, the function should not insert a new node.\n\nAlternatively, modify the condition to insert into the left or right subtree when there is a choice.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps the condition in the else should be only if val is greater than root.val. Otherwise, when val is equal, we treat it as part of the else and go right, which is invalid.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nif val < root.val:\n    insert into left\nelif val > root.val:\n    insert into right\nelse:\n    return root (as the value is found, do not insert again)\n\nWait, but that would mean that the function returns without inserting the node, which is allowed if we don't want duplicates.\n\nBut since the function is called insert, perhaps it's better not to allow duplicates. So the function would not insert, but that's acceptable since the BST's find_in_bst would return True.\n\nBut the problem says to 'insert a new node into the BST', so perhaps we have to insert regardless. Because for example, if the BST is allowed to have duplicates, you can have multiple nodes with the same value. But according to BST properties, this is possible only if say, in the left or right some condition is applied.\n\nBut for standard BSTs, no duplicates are allowed because each insertion of a duplicate can cause violations in the structure.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the function should check whether the value is already present. If not, insert, else do not.\n\nWait, but that would complicate the insert function as it would have to first perform a search.\n\nAlternatively, when inserting, during the process of searching for the insertion point, when a node with the same value is found, the function can choose to insert the new node in the left or right subtree.\n\nIn that case, perhaps we can adjust the condition in the insert function.\n\nWait, perhaps, after some research, in BST implementations, allowing duplicates can be done in either left or right side. For instance, in some implementations, when val equals, insert into the left; in others, into the right.\n\nBut the standard is to not allow duplicates.\n\nBut in this case, since the function is to insert a new node with the given value, perhaps it's expected to allow duplicates as per some condition.\n\nAlternatively, for the problem, perhaps it's best to proceed under the assumption that the tree does not allow duplicates, and the insert_in_bst function should not insert a new node if the value is already present in the tree.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm, this adds complexity because now, in addition to insertion, we have to search for the target.\n\nWait, so perhaps in insert_in_bst:\n\n- If the current root is null, create a new node.\n\n- Else, compare the val with root.val.\n\n- If val is less than root.val, and root has a left child, proceed to left subtree.\n\n- If val is greater than root.val, and root has a right child, proceed.\n\nBut in this approach, if the value is already present in root, don't do anything.\n\nBut how would that work in practice?\n\nWait, let me think about the insert function:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val == root.val:\n        return root\n    elif val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nIn this code, if val is equal to root.val, the function returns the root, so no insertion is done.\n\nSimilarly, when inserting into the left or right subtree, if the value is already present, no new node is created.\n\nSo, this would prevent duplicates.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, inserting a new node is required. So the function's docstring says 'inserts a new node with the given value into the BST'.\n\nSo, this could be conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should insert the node, even if the value exists.\n\nSo, perhaps the insert function code should allow inserting the node whenever the current path is followed, regardless of whether the same val exists.\n\nBut that would require that each insertion, even when the val exists, takes a path to the furthest possible node, and creates a new node.\n\nSo for example, the code can be:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nThis way, if val is equal, the function ignores and proceeds to return root, but does not insert a new node.\n\nWait, but this may not cover the case where the insertion point is when it reaches a leaf node.\n\nWait, no, the function is correct. Because, when val is less than the root, it proceeds to left, regardless of whether the root's left is null or not. If root.left is null, function returns a new node. So the insertion should work.\n\nFor example, inserting a new node in a BST:\n\nroot = 5\n\nInsert 3: 3 is less than 5, left is null. So node is created as left.\n\nInsert 7: 7 is greater than 5, right is null, node is created.\n\nInsert 3 again: 5's left is 3. Now, in the code, val is equal to 3, so function returns root.left. So no new node is added.\n\nBut according to the function's docstring, it's inserting a new node. So in this case, it's not doing that.\n\nHmm, that's conflicting.\n\nThus, perhaps the function should allow inserting even if the value exists, but this would require changing the code to:\n\nWhen val is equal to root.val, insert into one of the subtrees.\n\nBut where?\n\nPerhaps, if the value is equal, insert into the left (or right) subtree.\n\nSo, modify the condition to:\n\nif val < root.val:\n\n    go left\n\nelif val >= root.val:\n\n    go right\n\nSo, for example:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nIn this code, when val is equal, it goes to the right, ensuring that duplicate nodes are added to the right of the existing node.\n\nThis allows multiple insertions of the same value, each insertion creating a new node to the right.\n\nBut in this case, the BST property would be violated because in the right subtree, nodes may have a value equal to the parent's.\n\nWhich is incorrect, as per BST properties.\n\nHmm, perhaps then, the function is only correct if the insertion only adds nodes that don't violate the BST property. So, perhaps the initial approach, treating insert_in_bst to disallow duplicates, is better.\n\nBut in that case, the function's behavior is to not insert when the value is present. But according to the function's docstring, it's supposed to insert a new node.\n\nI need to make a decision on this.\n\nSince the problem says 'insert a new node into the BST', perhaps it's better to always insert the new node regardless, and the code should be structured to handle duplicates correctly.\n\nBut how to ensure that the BST property is maintained with duplicates.\n\nOne way is to allow duplicates in the left or right.\n\nFor example, when a new node is inserted, if the value is equal to the parent, insert into the left. This would ensure that the right subtree still maintains all elements greater than root.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Because all the elements in the left subtree are allowed to be less than or equal? Or just less?\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach could cause the BST to become invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can treat the case when val is equal as inserting into the left. So:\n\nIf val < root.val: go left.\n\nElse if val > root.val: go right.\n\nElse (val == root.val):\n\n    insert into the left subtree.\n\nThis way, duplicates are added to the left, but the BST property is maintained. But wait, that's not correct. Because inserting the same value to the left of a node causes that node's left to have a value equal to it, which violates the BST property that all nodes in the left should be less than the parent.\n\nSo, that would break the BST property.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. So, in conclusion, I think the safest way is to implement the insert_in_bst function that allows insertion only when the value is not present. Thus, the function would return the same tree when attempting to insert a duplicate.\n\nThus, the functions are as follows:\n\nFor find_in_bst:\n\nWe recursively check left or right subtree based on comparison.\n\nFor insert_in_bst, we check each condition, and insert the node when the path dictates, but only if the node doesn't already exist.\n\nSo I can proceed to write the code as for find_in_bst is straightforward recursive search.\n\nFor insert_in_bst, the code is:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # else, do nothing as value exists already\n    return root\n\nWait, but according to the function's docstring, it should 'insert a new node into the BST.'\n\nSo, this code won't do that. It will not insert if the value is already present.\n\nThis seems conflicting with the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps the problem expects that duplication is allowed and the function proceeds to insert in such a way that the tree allows.\n\nBut this brings us back to the issue that inserting a value in the right subtree when val == current node's value would cause the BST property to be violated.\n\nThus, perhaps the function is, after all, allowing insertion regardless, but the code must be written to handle it.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the insert function, even if the value is equal, proceed to insert into the left or right.\n\nPerhaps inserting into the right as in the earlier code would cause BST violation, but perhaps the problem is lenient.\n\nThus, the code I'll present is that.\n\nBut, overall, perhaps I should proceed as per the standard approach, not allowing duplication, because in the BST, that is the correct behavior.\n\nSo, given that, the insert_in_bst function is as follows.\n\nAnd the find function is standard.\n\nThus, putting it all together.\n\nSo, final functions:\n\nFind in BST:\n\ndef find_in_bst(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:\n    if root is None:\n        return False\n    if target == root.val:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\nInsert into BST:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # Do nothing if val == root.val\n    return root\n\nBut then, according to the problem statement, this would not insert a new node if the value already exists.\n\nHmm, in some cases, this is correct.\n\nBut according to the function's description, the insert_in_bst is supposed to insert a new node. So the code is not fulfilling the problem statement.\n\nAh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Oh wait, wait, maybe when the function says 'insert a new node' it refers to the fact that the function returns the new root, but in cases where root is not null, it may just update children.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nWait, no, the code returns the same root if the value was not inserted.\n\nWait, but the TreeNode is being modified, right? So in the case where the tree structure changes, the functions update the root's left or right pointers accordingly.\n\nThus, in that sense, the function does insert the node, unless the value is already present.\n\nSo the function will return the modified root, which may or may not have added a new node.\n\nBut, again, if the value is already present, the function doesn't add a new node, thus not inserting.\n\nWhich seems correct behavior, as inserting a duplication would create a node with the same value, which could be against BST properties.\n\nIn that case, according to the problem, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut the function's docstring says 'inserts a new node with given value into the BST.' So, perhaps in this case, the function is supposed to create and insert the node even if the value is present.\n\nWhich would mean, no, the code as written does not fulfill the function's requirements.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem expects that the function adds the node regardless of the presence of the value. So, the insert_in_bst function would modify the tree each time, adding the new node, possibly breaking the BST structure.\n\nBut that can't be right, because that would create an invalid tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the insert_in_bst function should proceed as per a BST with possible duplicates but in a manner that the overall BST structure is maintained. So perhaps when inserting a duplicate, it is placed in either left or right in such a way that BST property isn't violated.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on this, perhaps should proceed with the code that satisfies the standard BST properties and proceed to solve accordingly.\n\nThus, the functions are as above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement two functions for a binary search tree (BST): one to search for a target value and another to insert a new node with a given value. The BST must maintain its properties such that each node's left child has a smaller value and each node's right child has a larger value than the node itself.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Search in BST (find_in_bst)**:\n   - This function searches for a target value in the BST recursively. If the tree is empty, the target is not present, so it returns `False`. If the target is found, it returns `True`. If the target is less than the current node's value, the search continues in the left subtree. Otherwise, the search continues in the right subtree.\n\n2. **Insert into BST (insert_in_bst)**:\n   - This function inserts a new node with a given value into the BST while maintaining the BST properties. If the tree is empty, a new node is created and returned. If the value is less than the current node's value, the insertion is handled recursively in the left subtree. If the value is greater, the insertion is handled in the right subtree. If the value is already present, the function does not insert a duplicate node to avoid violating the BST properties.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef find_in_bst(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the target value in the BST and returns True if found, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return False\n    if target == root.val:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts a new node with given value into the BST.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **find_in_bst**:\n  - This function uses recursion to traverse the BST. It starts at the root and checks if the current node contains the target value. If not, it continues the search in the appropriate subtree based on whether the target is less than or greater than the current node's value. This ensures that each node is checked efficiently without violating the BST properties.\n\n- **insert_in_bst**:\n  - This function also uses recursion to find the correct position to insert the new node. If the tree is empty, a new node is created. For non-empty trees, the function navigates to the left or right subtree based on the comparison with the current node's value. Duplicates are not inserted to maintain the BST properties, ensuring that each insertion operation preserves the structure of the BST.",
