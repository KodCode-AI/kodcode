  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write two functions for a binary search tree: one to search for a target value and return True if found, and another to insert a new value. Hmm, I remember that in a BST, each node's left child has a smaller value and the right child a larger one. So for the search function, I should start at the root and go left or right based on the target compared to the current node's value. If I hit a null, then it's not there, so return False.\n\nWait, the parameters are root: TreeNode and target: int. So each function takes the root as the starting point. For the search function:\n\nI think a recursive approach might be easier. Like, if the root is null, return False. Otherwise, if target is less than root.val, search the left subtree. If target is greater, search the right. If it's equal, return True.\n\nFor the insert function, similar logic. If the root is null, create a new node as the root. Else, if val is less than root's value, go to the left and insert, else go to the right. Need to return the new node, but when inserting recursively, I have to make sure I connect the new node properly.\n\nWait, but the insert function's return type is TreeNode. So each insertion might adjust the root. So, in the insert function, if the root is null, return a new TreeNode with val. Else, if val is less than root.val, root.left becomes insert_in_bst(root.left, val). Similarly for the right. Finally, return the root, as the tree structure may have added a new node.\n\nWait, but in Python, when a function returns null, perhaps that's okay because when root is None, the initial insert creates the node.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nSearch:\nIf root is None, return False.\nIf target == root.val, return True.\nIf target < root.val, recursively search left.\nIf target > root.val, recursively search right.\n\nInsert:\nIf root is None, return TreeNode(val).\nIf val < root.val, set root.left to insert(root.left, val).\nIf val > root.val, set root.right to insert(root.right, val).\nIf val == root.val, maybe do nothing if duplicates are not allowed, but since the problem says to insert a new node, perhaps we assume no duplicates. Or do we need to handle that? The question isn't clear, so I'll assume all insertions are for unique values.\n\nWait, no, the problem says 'insert a new node' regardless. So for for duplicate values, maybe we insert as per BST rules. For example, if we have 5 and insert 5 again, where does it go? Does the problem allow duplicates? I'm not sure, but since it's BST, often each value is unique, but the insert function still needs to handle it. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps in the function, if val equals root.val, we can choose a side, maybe always left or right.\n\nBut looking at insert_in_bst, perhaps for now we can assume that if val is equal, we do nothing, but that might not be correct. Or, perhaps, in BSTs, nodes with the same value go on the left or right. Since the original problem doesn't specify, but the function needs to return the correct tree.\n\nWait, in BSTs, usually, duplicates are either allowed on the left or the right. So perhaps, for the purpose of these functions, I should make a decision. Let's say, if the val is equal, we insert it on the left or maybe the right. Alternatively, in an insert function, it's common to have each value once. So perhaps in the problem, when inserting, val is unique. Therefore, the insert function can assume no duplicates.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. So maybe if value is equal, we can do nothing. Or, as the problem says, 'insert a new node', so perhaps in that case, even if the value is same, create a new node. Hmm, but that would create duplicates in the tree. So perhaps the insert function will still add the node, according to BST rules.\n\nWait, for the given problem, the first function is a search function. So insert needs to correctly handle all cases, including when val is already in the tree.\n\nWait, but the problem says to insert a new node, regardless of whether the value exists. Maybe that's not the case. So perhaps in the insert function, it's better to handle it as per BST logic, even if the value is already present. Some BSTs don't allow duplicates, but perhaps in this case, it's acceptable. So for my function, I should write it so that if the value is already present, nothing happens, or in another approach, it's added as per BST rules.\n\nBut to get into the problem, perhaps the function is expected to handle the BST in the standard way. So, for the insert function:\n\nIf root is null, create a new node. That's the base case.\n\nElse, if the value is less than root.val: insert into the left subtree.\n\nElse, if greater than, insert into the right.\n\nIf equal, perhaps do nothing and return.\n\nBut that depends on how the BST is designed. So perhaps for this problem, the insert function can be written as:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # if val == root.val, do nothing\n    return root\n\nWait, but does that mean that duplicates are not inserted? So in that case, the tree remains the same. But perhaps the problem expects that. Or, perhaps in another approach, when val is equal to root.val, insert on the left or the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BST should allow duplicates, which is possible, but the find_in_bst function would find the value if present, whether duplicated or not.\n\nHmm. Let me think about this: The problem says \"inserts a new node into the BST\". So if the value is already present, I think we still have to add the new node. So perhaps the insert function should allow that.\n\nIn that case, when a value equal is found, we have to decide whether to add it to the left or right. I think commonly, for duplicates, in some implementations, they are inserted to the right, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for this function, maybe just add it to the right. Or perhaps in this case, when val is equal, we just compare again, but since the BST is built for unique values, that might not be needed.\n\nWait, no. The function is supposed to insert a new node regardless of whether the value is there or not. So suppose in the tree, we have 5, and we insert 5 again. So perhaps in this case, the new 5 would go to the left or right of the existing 5 node.\n\nBut the standard BST doesn't usually allow duplicates, but the function description doesn't specify. So perhaps, I should handle this case: if val is equal to root's value, perhaps we don't do anything, which would prevent duplicates. Or, perhaps, always insert on one side.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects that after insertion, the tree still remains a BST. So to maintain BST properties, how should duplicates be inserted?\n\nWell, in some BST implementations, all nodes with the same value go to the left, others to the right. So perhaps in this case, when val is less than or equal, go left, and greater than go right. Or, the other way around.\n\nBut I think the problem doesn't cover that scenario. So to make progress, perhaps in this function, duplicate checks are not done. So if val is equal to root.val, do nothing. Because the sample input might not test that case. Or perhaps the problem expects that, for example, that once a value is present, the insert function can still proceed to insert it, but for that, maybe the code will have to decide. \n\nBut perhaps for the sake of this function, the code should allow inserting the value regardless of whether it's already present. So I'll need to proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but for now, let's proceed with writing the code for search and insert.\n\nWait, also, the functions are in Python. The problem uses the same style as LeetCode, where the TreeNode is defined with val, left, right.\n\nSo for the search function:\n\n- If root is None, return False.\n\n- Else, compare target to root.val.\n\n- If equal, return True.\n\n- If target < root.val, recursively search in left.\n\n- If target > root.val, recursively search in right.\n\nBut in Python, we can't have the recursive calls for each condition, so I'll need to make sure each case is handled.\n\nWait, for the recursive approach, for the find_in_bst function:\n\ndef find_in_bst(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:\n    if not root:\n        return False\n    if root.val == target:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So that's the function.\n\nFor the insert:\n\nAs for the insert function, it's a bit more involved because each recursive call returns a node, which may be a new one.\n\nSo:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # if val == root.val, do nothing?\n    return root\n\nWait, but in this case, if the value is already present, the function ignores it. So why would that be the case? Because maybe in a BST, we don't allow duplicate values, so inserting a value that already exists does nothing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that duplicates are allowed. So, how to handle that. I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function should insert the value regardless. So, I should modify the function.\n\nBut in LeetCode-like problems, the BST can have duplicates. So perhaps I need to handle that, allowing for insertion of duplicates. For example, in some problems, like in search where you return True even if multiple copies exist.\n\nSo in that case, perhaps when val is equal to current node, we should insert it to either left or right subtree. So, to maintain the BST property, when val is equal, we can insert into the left subtree or the right subtree.\n\nBut which side is it? By convention, in some implementations, like in TreeSet in Java, it's a NavigableSet and does not allow duplicates. But in the problem statement, it's just a BST.\n\nSo, perhaps if val is equal to current node, we insert into the right subtree? Or the left? Hmm.\n\nWait, for example, when inserting 5 into a BST that already has 5, we can insert the new 5 on either left or right, but to maintain the BST property, it can go either, but that way the in-order traversal will show duplicates.\n\nSo, to handle duplicates, perhaps in the insert function:\n\nIf val is less than or equal to current node's value, insert into left.\n\nElse, insert into right.\n\nWait, no, that approach can cause the BST structure to become unbalanced. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the function can allow duplicates and insert them, say, to the right. So whenever the val is equal to current node's val, we insert into the right.\n\nWait, but in that case, inserting 5 into a tree where 5 already exists would add it to the right subtree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is expecting that the inserted value is unique, so no handling for duplicates.\n\nGiven that the function is called 'insert_in_bst' and the problem says \"insert a new node\", it's not clear whether it should handle duplicates. But perhaps the function is intended to make sure that the new node is inserted only if it's not already present.\n\nSo, in that case, the insert function shouldn't add duplicates.\n\nSo, in that case, the code I wrote earlier is correct.\n\nBut to make sure the function always returns the correct BST, perhaps better to think about the user's insertions in a way that maintains the BST structure. So if the function is called with a value that's already in the tree, it is inserted as per BST rules, possibly added as a duplicate in the appropriate subtree.\n\nWait, perhaps that's necessary because some test cases may require inserting the same value multiple times and finding it. For example, in a find operation, if a node is inserted twice, find_in_bst would still return True.\n\nWait, but according to how find_in_bst is written, it would stop at the first occurrence and return True. So perhaps the insertion should not prevent including duplicates.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the insert_in_bst function should always insert a new node when called, regardless of whether the value is present, so long as it's following BST rules.\n\nSo in that case, the insert function would have to handle the equal case.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf val is equal to current node, the next step is to decide whether to go left or right. For instance, if the current node's value is 5, and we're trying to insert 5, perhaps we can connect it to the left or right.\n\nI think in such a case, in many implementations, duplicates are inserted as children of the existing node. For example, inserting duplicate to the right each time. So perhaps in our insert function, when val is equal, we insert on the right.\n\nWait, no, that might not handle all cases. For example, inserting 5, then inserting 5, it would go right. But what if we then insert 5 again?\n\nHmm, perhaps the standard approach is to allow duplicates and insert them on one side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem just needs a function that inserts a new node, whether or not the value exists, as long as it's in the correct BST position.\n\nSo, for the insert_in_bst function, if the root is not null:\n\n- if val < root.val, insert into left subtree.\n\n- else, insert into right subtree.\n\nSo, this would include val == root.val, and in that case, insert into right.\n\nWait, that conflicts with BST structure because if a node's right child is greater than or equal? Well, some BSTs allow that.\n\nWait, in a standard BST, each node's left child is less than the node's value, and the right is greater. So if the val is equal, inserting to the right would make it greater than or equal, which would break the BST rules.\n\nWait, no, because in some definitions, a BST can have duplicates in right or left. It depends on the definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should allow that.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me search for how BST insertions are handled for duplicates.\n\nIn some definitions, for a node in the BST:\n\n- All nodes in the left subtree are less than the node's value.\n\n- All nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.\n\nThis does not allow duplicates.\n\nIn other definitions, it's allowed, and each node's left subtree is less than or equal, and right subtree is greater than or equal.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, it's better to treat val as unique, so in the insert function, we don't handle duplicates by adding new nodes if the value already exists.\n\nTherefore, in that case, the insert_in_bst function I wrote earlier is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the function can insert the same value multiple times, so that the BST has multiple nodes with the same value, which may affect the search function.\n\nIn that case, for the search function, it would still find it, but for the insert function, we need to allow adding nodes with same value.\n\nSo perhaps the function should insert the new node as per BST rules when val is equal to current node's val.\n\nSo for this, when val == current node's val, perhaps we insert to the left.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val <= root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So when val is less than or equal to root's val, go to the left. Otherwise, go to the right.\n\nThis way, when val is equal, it's added as a left child.\n\nBut that would allow multiple nodes with same value to be accumulated in the left.\n\nIn an in-order traversal, they would all appear before the node in question.\n\nBut perhaps the function's test cases expect both functions to handle duplicates.\n\nBut given the problem's wording, I'm uncertain. So perhaps, to write the insert function without handling duplicate val and that the tree contains unique values.\n\nIn that case, the code I wrote earlier is acceptable.\n\nBut to get to the point, since it's about implementing BST search and insert, perhaps for each function, write them as recursive functions. For the search function, yes, the initial approach is correct.\n\nBut for the insert function, perhaps I need to handle the case where val is equal by returning without changing the tree.\n\nWait, but in cases where val is in the tree, you can do nothing, and return the root as before.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I think I have the functions.\n\nSo the final code will be:\n\nImplement find_in_bst as a recursive function checking each node.\n\nImplement insert_in_bst recursively, adding to left or right as necessary, and ignoring duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, in the insert function, only insert if the val is not present.\n\nBut wait, the function's description says \"insert a new node\", which suggests that it's meant to be added regardless, but perhaps only in the BST position, even if the value is already present.\n\nIn that case, the function should proceed to add even when current node has the same value.\n\nSo perhaps when val == root.val is the same, how do I handle it.\n\nWell, perhaps the function only inserts when the correct spot is found.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut considering the time, perhaps I should proceed to write the code as per the first approach.\n\nSo, for the functions:\n\nFind:\n\nLooks correct as I wrote earlier.\n\nInsert:\n\nIf root is null, create a new node; else go left if val < current, or right if val > current. If equal, do nothing.\n\nWait, but if I do nothing when val is equal to current, then inserting a value that's not in the tree won't work. Because the function may not reach where it should. So perhaps that's a bug.\n\nWait, no. Because the recursive steps will go down to null, and then insert.\n\nWait, no.\n\nFor example, let's say I have a tree with root.val=5. I want to insert a new 3. It should go left. So the function in insert_in_bst would compare 3 <5, so go left. Root.left is None, so creates a new node 3.\n\nBut suppose the tree also has a left child with 3. Then, when inserting 3 again, the function:\n\nAt root (5), compare 3<5, go left.\n\nNow current becomes 3. Then, compare 3 == 3. Do nothing. So the function returns root. So the new 3 is not added.\n\nWhich means the function would not add duplicates, which may be incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct approach is probably to change the insert function to handle when val is equal.\n\nSo to do that, perhaps, when val == root.val, decide which side to insert. For example, in some BST implementations, when a duplicate is inserted, it can be on the left or right. So perhaps for this problem, let's choose to insert the new node as a right child. So when val is equal, proceed to right.\n\nThus, the insert function becomes:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nWait, so if val is greater than or equal (because of else), we insert to the right. So for duplicates, the node will be added to the right.\n\nBut in this case, the tree would have duplicates, but all the nodes in the right subtree would have values greater than or equal to the current node.\n\nSo for example, a node with value 5, who's right child is 5 (because we inserted 5 again) would violate the BST property only if its right child has a value less than 5, which is not the case.\n\nHmm, no, because in a BST, each node's right subtree must have all elements greater than the node's value.\n\nWait, no. In a BST, all nodes in the left subtree are less than the current node, and all nodes in the right are greater than. So if the current node is 5, and its right subtree has another 5, then that 5 is in the right subtree, which is supposed to contain only values greater than 5. 5 is not greater than 5, so this breaks the BST property.\n\nTherefore, inserting duplicates to the right breaks BST structure. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nSo what is the solution?\n\nPerhaps when inserting duplicates, the function should be designed to either allow them or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the problem, the function can be written with the understanding that the inserted val is unique, and if the same value exists, the insertion is skipped.\n\nIn that case, the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps in that case, the insert function is written as ignoring duplicates.\n\nBut now I'm getting stuck on whether to allow duplicates or not, since the problem isn't clear.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps I should proceed. So, in the insert function, implement the function as:\n\nStart with base case. If root is null, create new node.\n\nFor equal cases, perhaps approach is to exit without inserting again.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # else, do nothing\n    return root\n\nSo, duplicates are not inserted. This ensures that the tree has unique values. The find function will still return True for values present.\n\nTherefore, the functions are correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement two functions for a binary search tree (BST): one to search for a target value and another to insert a new node with a given value. In a BST, each node's left child has a smaller value and the right child has a larger value. \n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Search Function (`find_in_bst`)**:\n    - The function starts at the root of the BST.\n    - If the current node is `None`, the target value is not present, so return `False`.\n    - If the target value is found at the current node, return `True`.\n    - If the target value is less than the current node's value, recursively search in the left subtree.\n    - If the target value is greater, recursively search in the right subtree.\n\n2. **Insert Function (`insert_in_bst`)**:\n    - If the current node is `None`, create a new node with the given value and return it.\n    - If the value to be inserted is less than the current node's value, recursively insert it into the left subtree.\n    - If the value is greater, recursively insert it into the right subtree.\n    - If the value is already present (equal to the current node's value), do not insert it again to maintain unique values in the BST.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef find_in_bst(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the target value in the BST and returns True if found, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not root:\n        return False\n    if root.val == target:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts a new node with given value into the BST.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not root:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    elif val > root.val:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    # Do not insert duplicate values\n    return root\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Search Function**: The function efficiently traverses the BST by comparing the target value with the current node's value, moving left or right as appropriate. This ensures that the search is done in O(h) time complexity, where h is the height of the tree.\n- **Insert Function**: The function also traverses the BST to find the correct position for the new node.
