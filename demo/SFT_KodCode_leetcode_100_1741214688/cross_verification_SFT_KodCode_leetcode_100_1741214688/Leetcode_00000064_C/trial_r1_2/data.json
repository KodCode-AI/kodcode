  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to implement these two functions, find_in_bst and insert_in_bst. Let me think about how to approach each of them.\n\nStarting with find_in_bst. I remember that BSTs have the property that all nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and all nodes in the right subtree are larger. So to find a target, I can traverse the tree by comparing the target with the current node's value.\n\nWait, how does the traversal work? Oh right, if the target is less than the current node's value, we go to the left child. If it's greater, we go to the right. We keep doing this until we either find the target (return True) or reach a null (return False).\n\nWhat about edge cases? Like if the root is null. Oh right, in that case, the tree is empty, so target isn't present. So first check if root is None, return False.\n\nSo the structure would be something like:\n\ndef find_in_bst(root, target):\n    if root is None:\n        return False\n    if root.val == target:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\nThat seems straightforward. But wait, do I have to handle duplicates? Well, the problem statement probably assumes no duplicates, since it's a BST. Otherwise, the function may not work correctly if duplicates are present but it's not part of the initial problem setup. So I can proceed under the assumption that the tree has unique values.\n\nNow for the insert_in_bst function. It's about adding a new node into the BST correctly. So again, we can traverse the tree, similar to the find function.\n\nHow? Well, we start at the root. If the value is less than the current node, we go left, else right. We continue until we find a spot where the current node's child is null, and insert the new node there.\n\nBut wait, what if the tree is empty? Then we return a new node as the root.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- If the root is None, create a new TreeNode with the given value and return it.\n- Else, compare the value with root's value.\n- If less, recursively insert into left subtree. Then assign the returned node to root's left.\n- Else, insert into right subtree and assign to root's right.\n\nWait, but the function has to return the root, which is needed for the recursive calls to update the parent's child.\n\nAlternatively, the function could modify the tree in place, but since in Python we don't have pointers, perhaps returning the new root each time is easier.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root, val):\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n\nWait, but what about if val is equal to root.val? Oh right, because in a BST, we usually don't allow duplicates. So it's better to handle that case, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Well, if the tree allows duplicates, perhaps it's better to insert in the left or right. But without specifications, it's safer to assume that we need to insert only if the value isn't present. Hmm, but the function is to insert a new node regardless, I think. So we'll proceed and allow duplicates, perhaps by inserting into the right subtree if equal.\n\nWait, no. Because according to BST properties, all values equal can be on one side. But perhaps the way I have the code now, if val equals root.val, it will be inserted in the right. That may break the BST property, or not. Let me think.\n\nActually, if the val is equal to the root's value, adding it as the left or right child depends. But this can cause unbalanced trees. But for the purpose of insertion, the code needs to add the node. So perhaps, if val is less than or equal, put it left, else right. No, wait, that depends on the definition.\n\nWait, standard BST inserts for equal goes to either left or right, but it's implementation-dependent. Since the problem says to insert a new node, perhaps the existing tree may not have that value. Or perhaps the function is supposed to handle possible duplicates. But without guidance, perhaps I should just follow the logic of if value is less than root, go left, else go right. So if value is equal to root, it goes right.\n\nBut wait, suppose the tree has a node with value 5, and we insert another 5. Then according to the current code, it would insert the duplicate as the right child. Which is acceptable as per BST definitions, as some definitions allow equal in the right.\n\nHmm, but in find_in_bst, if the function is looking for a target that's present multiple times, it may return True as long as it finds one occurrence.\n\nBut regardless, for the insert function, perhaps the code in this form is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the value is already present? Like inserting a value that's already in the tree. Do we need to avoid duplicates? The insert_in_bst function's description is to insert a new node. So perhaps it's expected that we should only insert it if it doesn't already exist. But the find function would have to be called before insertion, which could complicate things.\n\nWait, no, let's re-examine the problem statements.\n\nThe find_in_bst returns True if found, else False. The insert_in_bst is to insert a new node with the given value. So if the value is already present, should the insertion function not add a duplicate?\n\nBut in the case of a normal BST, usually each node has a unique value. So perhaps the insertion function does not allow duplicates, meaning that it should not insert if the value already exists.\n\nWait, but in the insertion code, we proceed to insert, regardless of whether the value is already in the tree. So that could create duplicates, which is not correct.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the insertion function should first check if the target exists. Or, in the insert function, as we traverse, if we find a node with the same value, we stop and don't insert.\n\nBut how to modify the insert function to prevent duplicates.\n\nSo in that case, perhaps the insert function needs to check while traversing, and only insert if the value is not found.\n\nWait, but that would cause the function to have redundant code, since the find function is already there. Alternatively, perhaps the insert function can call the find function and only proceed with insertion if the find returns False.\n\nWait, let's think about this. So, in the insert_in_bst function, first perform a search to check if the value exists. If it doesn't, then proceed with the insertion logic.\n\nBut that approach may not be the most efficient, as it traverses the tree twice. For large trees, that's not ideal. But perhaps for the scope of this problem, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the functions are intended to not handle duplicates, and the insertion will add nodes regardless of existing duplicates. Maybe the problem doesn't worry about that, and we're to proceed as per the initial code.\n\nWell, perhaps the problem statement expects the functions to assume the BST contains unique values, but the insert function should handle the insertion correctly to maintain the BST property.\n\nSo let me think: for the insert function as I wrote before, if the tree doesn't have the value, it will be inserted. If it does, inserting it may lead to a BST that allows duplicates, which may not be in line with some BST definitions.\n\nWait, but in that case, the problem statement is to insert the new node, regardless of duplicates. So, perhaps the code I wrote is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the insert function should first check if the node exists and not insert, but the problem says to insert a new node. So, no, perhaps the function is supposed to insert a new node, regardless of whether the value exists.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial code for insert_in_bst is correct.\n\nWait, but that could create problems when the BST is used for other purposes. For example, when using find_in_bst after inserting a duplicate, it will find the value, but the BST structure may have multiple nodes with the same value. But since the problem says, insert the new node, it's probably the right approach.\n\nSo perhaps the insert function as written is correct.\n\nAnother point: the function must return the root of the modified tree. So, the initial code does that.\n\nWait, no, in my initial code, the function returns root, but when the root was None, it returns the new node. Otherwise, the code makes the recursive calls and assigns the result to root.left or root.right, then returns root, which is correct.\n\nI think so, yes.\n\nSo, that should cover the insertion.\n\nBut let's think about an example.\n\nSuppose the BST has a root 5. I call insert with 3. It creates a new node as root.left. Then, inserting 6 would go to root.right.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut what about inserting into a subtree whose child is None.\n\nYes, for example, root is 5, root.left is 3, root.right is 7. Inserting 6: since 6 <7 is false, 6>5, so in the root node, 6 would go to the right subtree. Once at root, val=7, 6 <7, so insert into left. Since root.left is None (assuming 7's left is none), then a new node is created and assigned to 7's left.\n\nSo insertion is correct.\n\nSo, I think the functions will work as intended.\n\nAnother thought: in the insert function, what is the base case when the tree is empty? Then the function returns a new TreeNode, which becomes the root. That's correct.\n\nSo to sum up, for find_in_bst:\n\n- Traverse BST, check left or right based on comparison.\n- Return True if found, False otherwise.\n\nFor insert_in_bst:\n\n- Traverse to location where the new node should be, then create and assign.\n- Return the modified root.\n\nSo I think implementing these functions as per the initial thoughts should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement two functions: `find_in_bst` and `insert_in_bst` for a Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST is a data structure where each node has a comparable value, and for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **find_in_bst**: This function searches for a target value in the BST and returns `True` if the value is found, otherwise it returns `False`.\n    - **Algorithm**:\n        1. If the current node is `None`, return `False` (target not found).\n        2. If the current node's value is equal to the target, return `True`.\n        3. If the target is less than the current node's value, recursively search the left subtree.\n        4. If the target is greater, recursively search the right subtree.\n\n2. **insert_in_bst**: This function inserts a new node with a given value into the BST and returns the root of the modified tree.\n    - **Algorithm**:\n        1. If the current node is `None`, create a new node with the given value and return it.\n        2. If the given value is less than the current node's value, recursively insert the value into the left subtree and update the left child of the current node.\n        3. If the given value is greater, recursively insert the value into the right subtree and update the right child of the current node.\n        4. Return the current node after updating its children.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef find_in_bst(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the target value in the BST and returns True if found, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return False\n    if root.val == target:\n        return True\n    elif target < root.val:\n        return find_in_bst(root.left, target)\n    else:\n        return find_in_bst(root.right, target)\n\ndef insert_in_bst(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"\n    Inserts a new node with the given value into the BST.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:\n        return TreeNode(val)\n    if val < root.val:\n        root.left = insert_in_bst(root.left, val)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert_in_bst(root.right, val)\n    return root\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **find_in_bst**:\n  - This function efficiently traverses the BST by comparing the target value with the current node's value. It narrows down the search space by moving to the left or right subtree based on the comparison, ensuring a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree.\n\n- **insert_in_bst**:\n  - This function navigates through the BST to find the appropriate location for the new node. It ensures the BST properties are maintained by placing smaller values in the left subtree and larger values in the right subtree. The function handles edge cases such as an empty tree by creating a new root node if necessary. The time complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.\n\nBoth functions work efficiently for typical BST operations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced according to its properties.",
