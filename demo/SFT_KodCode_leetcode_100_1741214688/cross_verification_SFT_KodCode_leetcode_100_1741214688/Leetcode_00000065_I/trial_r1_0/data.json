  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the missing element in a sorted array that's supposed to contain integers from 1 to n. Hmm, wait, the array's length is n, right? Because if the array originally had all elements from 1 to n, it would be of length n. But since one is missing, the array's length is n-1. So the array given to me is of length n-1, and it should have the numbers from 1 to n except one.\n\nSo for example, in the sample given, when the array is [1,2,4,5,6], which is of length 5. Then n should be 6, but since one is missing, the array is n-1 in length. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. The array is initially sorted from 1 to n, but one is missing. So the array's length is n-1 because it's missing exactly one element.\n\nWait wait. Wait, let me see the examples again. For instance, in the first sample, the array is [1,2,4,5,6], which is 5 elements. That suggests that n is 6 (because 1 to 6 is 6 elements) and one is missing, making 5 elements. So generally, for an array of size m = n-1, the n is m + 1? Because n is the original numbers, which is the array length plus one when one is missing.\n\nWait no, wait. Let's take the sample where the array is length 5. Then the numbers go up to 6, because n would be 6. So the missing number is 3. So n is 6. So the array length (m) is n-1. So n = m + 1.\n\nOh right, so given the array's length m, n is m +1 because the array has numbers from 1 to m+1 but is missing one.\n\nWait, no. Because the array has m elements but the correct size is n, which is m+1. Because for a correct array with no missing, the numbers have to go from 1 to m+1 if the array length is m+1. So in this problem, the array is only m elements, but it should have been m+1, implying that n is m+1, and thus the sum approach can be used.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it. The sum of the first n integers is n*(n+1)/2. So if the array is the complete set, the sum is n*(n+1)/2. But in this case, since one is missing, the sum of the given array is equal to n*(n+1)/2 - missing.\n\nSo n should be the length of the array plus one. Because the array is missing one of the n numbers. So array length m = n-1.\n\nSo to find n, it should be m+1.\n\nWait, let's take the example:\n\nSample 1: array is [1,2,4,5,6], which is length 5. So m=5. Then n =5+1=6. The expected sum is 6*7/2 =21. The actual sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. Missing is 21-18=3. Correct.\n\nSample 2: [1,3,4,5], length 4, n=5 (since 4+1=5). Sum is 5*6/2=15. Actual sum is 1+3+4+5=13. Missing is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the approach is:\n\n1. Compute m as the length of the array. Then n is m+1.\n2. Compute the expected sum as n*(n+1)/2.\n3. Compute the actual sum of the array.\n4. The missing element is expected sum minus actual sum.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is very large? Like, up to 1e6? Then sum could be too big and cause integer overflow, but in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so that's probably not an issue.\n\nAnother approach is to find the missing element by checking for the first consecutive pair that is incorrect. For example, since the array is sorted in ascending order, the difference between consecutive elements should be 1. The first place where the difference is 2 is where the missing element is in between.\n\nLet's see sample 1: [1,2,4,5,6]. The differences are 1 (2-1), 2 (4-2), 1,1. So the missing is 3.\n\nSample 2: [1,3,4,5]. Differences are 2, 1,1. So missing is 2.\n\nSo for this approach:\n\nLoop through the array from 0 to len(array)-2:\n\n   for i in range(len(nums)-1):\n       if nums[i+1] - nums[i] !=1:\n           return nums[i]+1\n\nWait, but what about the end case? Like if the last element is n, and the missing is n? Wait, no, because n is the maximum in the array. But in the case of a missing first element.\n\nWait wait. Another example: array is [2,3,4,5,6]. So missing is 1. Then the differences between the first two are 1 (3-2=1). All the differences are 1 except between 6 and nothing. So in this case, the loop doesn't catch anything. So we have to return 1.\n\nAlternatively, if the array starts with 2, then after looping through, since we didn't find any difference greater than 1, we conclude that the missing is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if the missing is n, for example, array is [1,2,3,4,6] when n=6, no, wait n was computed as m+1=6 in this case. Because the array is of size 5, so n is 6. Wait, in that example, the array would have 1,2,3,4,6: sum is 16. Expected sum for n=6 is 21. Missing is 5, but the array n was 6? Wait m is 5, n is 6. The sum approach would find 21 -16=5 as missing.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the array is [1,2,3,4,6], which is sorted in order. The diff between 4 and 6 is 2, so the loop would find 5 as missing.\n\nSo the sum approach should work, regardless of where the missing element is.\n\nBut what if the array starts with 1 and is missing, say, 100? Then the array has other elements in order.\n\nWait, the array is given as sorted in ascending order, so in the case where the first element is m, and the next is m+1, and so on but the first element isn't 1. So for example, array is [2,3,4,5], n is 5, because m=4, n=5. The sum is 2+3+4+5=14 vs n*(n+1)/2 =15: missing is1.\n\nSo in this case, the sum method would correctly find it, but the consecutive approach wouldn't because all consecutive differences are one, but the first element is not 1.\n\nSo the consecutive approach would fail in cases where the missing element is 1, unless we also check if the first element is not 1. So the consecutive approach would need to have an additional check at the beginning to see if the first element is 1. Otherwise, it's missing 1.\n\nSo, perhaps, the sum approach is more robust and doesn't require additional checks.\n\nSo perhaps the sum method is better.\n\nBut let's think about the time complexity. Both approaches are O(n), but the sum approach could have smaller constants since it's a linear scan with one pass.\n\nBut in Python, for the sum approach, it's straightforward to implement. So for example, in code:\n\nn = len(nums) + 1\nexpected = n * (n + 1) // 2\nactual = sum(nums)\nmissing = expected - actual\n\nreturn missing\n\nThat's simple and should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo in the given sample, if the array is [1,2,4,5,6], len =5. n is 6. Expected sum 21. Actual sum 18. 3 is missing.\n\nIn another case, array is [2,3,4,5], len=4, n=5. Expected sum 15. Actual sum 14. So missing 1.\n\nAnother case where the array is [1,3,4,5], len=4, n=5. Sum 13, so 15-13=2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo implementing this in Python is straightforward.\n\nWait, but what about n*(n+1)/2? Because when n is large, n*(n+1) could cause integer issues in some languages, but in Python, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing to note: The array has exactly one missing element, so the sum approach is applicable. It wouldn't work for cases with multiple elements missing.\n\nSince the problem states that exactly one element is missing, the sum approach works.\n\nTherefore, the code will:\n\nCalculate the expected sum of the first (m+1) numbers, where m is len(nums). Subtract the actual sum of nums to find the missing number.\n\nSo in Python:\n\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    m = len(nums)\n    n = m +1\n    expected = n * (n +1) //2\n    actual = sum(nums)\n    return expected - actual\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the samples:\n\nSample 1: nums = [1,2,4,5,6]\nm=5, n=6. expected =6*7//2=21. sum is 18. 3.\n\nSample2: nums = [1,3,4,5], m=4. n=5. expected 15. sum is 13. 2.\n\nAnother test case: [2,3,4,5], m=4->n=5. sum is 14. 15-14=1.\n\nAnother test case: [1], m=1. n=2. expected 3. sum 1. 3-1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the missing element in a sorted array of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array plus one (since one element is missing). The array is initially sorted in ascending order but is missing exactly one element.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using the mathematical properties of the sum of the first n natural numbers. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula \\( \\text{sum} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). Here, n is the length of the array plus one, as the array is missing exactly one element. \n\n1. **Calculate the Expected Sum**: Compute the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula.\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum**: Sum the elements of the given array.\n3. **Find the Missing Element**: Subtract the actual sum from the expected sum to get the missing element.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the missing element in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the given array, making it both time and space efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    m = len(nums)\n    n = m + 1\n    expected = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual = sum(nums)\n    return expected - actual\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Calculate Expected Sum**: The expected sum of the first n natural numbers is calculated using the formula \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). Here, n is the length of the given array plus one (since one element is missing).\n2. **Calculate Actual Sum**: The sum of the elements in the given array is computed.\n3. **Compute Missing Element**: The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives the missing element. This works because the sum of the elements in the array is exactly the expected sum minus the missing element.\n\nThis method is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly identify the missing element with minimal computational overhead.",
