  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I have to find the missing element in an array that's originally sorted. The array has numbers from 1 to n, but one is missing. Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, no, the array is length n, but the numbers are from 1 to n inclusive except one is missing. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem says the array is 'consisting of integers from 1 to n inclusive'\u2014but wait, that can't be because n is the length of the array, which would mean if n is, say, 5, the array has 5 elements, each from 1-5. But if one is missing, that would mean 4 elements. Oh wait, no, the array's length is n, but the array is exactly missing one, so original size would have been n+1? Wait, the problem says nums is an array of integers from 1 to n. Oh, wait, n is the length of the array? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the description again.\n\nThe array is given as 'nums' consisting of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the array. Oh wait, that's not possible. Because if the array has n elements, each has to be unique, but the numbers are from 1 to n, which are also n unique numbers. Then missing one element\u2014so wait, the array is missing exactly one element? So the array's length is n-1? Or does the array have n elements that should include all from 1 to n+1 or something?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says nums is an array with integers from 1 to n inclusive, and the array is initially sorted in ascending order. But exactly one element is missing, and the array isn't necessarily contiguous. Wait, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, for example: the first example is [1,2,4,5,6], which has a length of 5. The missing element is 3. But wait, 1,2,3,4,5,6 is 6 elements, so the example given has n=5 as the array length, but that doesn't add up because 6 is in the array. Oh, maybe in the examples, the array includes numbers beyond n?\n\nWait, no, the exact problem statement says the array is from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length. So for example, if the array has length 5, then it contains numbers 1-5, but one is missing. But the example given is [1,2,4,5,6]. Wait, that's 5 elements, missing one from 6 elements? So that can't be, because if n is the length (which is 5), then the array should consist of numbers 1 to 5. But the example contains 6.\n\nSo I must be misunderstanding the problem statement. Let me reread it.\n\n\"array nums consisting of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the array.\"\n\nWait, that can't be, unless the array is of size n and has all numbers from 1 to n minus the missing. But that's possible. So the array should have been a complete set of 1..n, but exactly one is missing, so the array has n-1 elements.\n\nWait no, that's impossible because the array's length is n. So, perhaps I'm misled. Let me look at the examples again.\n\nFirst example: [1,2,4,5,6]. So the length is 5. It's missing 3. But the numbers go up to 6, which is higher than 5. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the array doesn't consist of exactly 1 to n, but perhaps 1 to m for some m, but in any case, the array is missing exactly one number.\n\nWait the problem statement may have a typo or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read it carefully again:\n\n\"You are given an array nums consisting of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the array.\"\n\nSo if the array is of length 5, then the elements should be 1, 2, 3,4,5. But one is missing, so the array has length 4. But this example has an array of length 5. Oh wait wait, wait, no: the first example given is 'nums is [1,2,4,5,6]', but lengths 5, and says the missing element is 3. So that suggests that n in this case is 6. Because the array is [1,2,4,5,6] which has 5 elements, but the missing is 3. So n is 6: the array consists of 1..6, excluding one, and the array has length 5. So the problem's general statement is: the array is a subset of 1..n, containing exactly n-1 elements, one missing.\n\nSo our task is, given such an array, find the missing number.\n\nNow, the array is not necessarily contiguous, but it was initially sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo first, the approach. We need to find the missing number in a sorted array of length (n-1), where the numbers are from 1 to n inclusive, missing exactly one.\n\nSo how to approach this.\n\nOption 1: Sum all elements and subtract from the expected sum.\n\nThe expected sum for 1..n is n*(n+1)/2. So for a given array, sum(nums) + missing = n(n+1)/2. So the missing is n(n+1)/2 - sum(nums). But wait, how do we find n?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, n is the length of the array plus one because array is missing one number. Because the original array should contain 1..n, which makes it a size of n, but if one is missing, the given array has size n-1.\n\nSo for example, in the first example, the array has 5 elements, and n is 6. So we can calculate the sum of 1+2+4+5+6 = (1+6)*6/2 = 21. The expected sum is 6*7/2=21? Wait that can't be. Wait no: no, wait, in the first example, the missing element is 3, so the array elements sum to 1+2+4+5+6 = 18. The sum of 1..6 is 21, so 21-18=3.\n\nWait yes, so for a given array, the sum is sum from 1 to n is (n)(n+1)/2. The given array has sum sum(nums). So the missing is sum(1..n) - sum(nums) = n(n+1)/2 - sum(nums).\n\nBut the problem is, we don't know n. So how do we find n?\n\nWait n is the maximum possible number, because the array is originally supposed to have numbers from 1 to n. But considering that one is missing, the maximum number in the array could be n, but it could be something else.\n\nWait, what is n in the context of the sum approach? Because for the sum to add up correctly, n would have to be the maximum possible number. But in the given arrays, perhaps the maximum is n. But that might not always be the case. Wait, for example, suppose n is 5 but the missing element is 5. Then the array would be [1,2,3,4], and the maximum element in the array is 4, but n is supposed to be 5. How would that work?\n\nWait maybe in this problem, the array may not have its maximum element as n because that element could be the one missing. So the approach needs to be, perhaps, to first find n.\n\nBut that's a problem because n is the number of elements in the original array plus one (as one is missing), but we only have the current array.\n\nWait, the array given may have length (n-1), but we don't know n. So how can we find n?\n\nWait wait, let's think differently. The current array has m elements, which is m = n-1. So to find the sum approach, we can compute the expected sum as (m+1)*(m+2)/2.\n\nFor instance, in the first example, m is 5, so n=6, sum is 21. The array's sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18, so missing is 3.\n\nSo, that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example: [1,3,4,5], which has length 4. So n is 5. Expected sum is 5*6/2=15. Array sum is 1+3+4+5=13. So missing is 2.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find the length m of the array. So m = len(nums).\n2. Compute n = m + 1.\n3. Compute the expected sum as n*(n+1) // 2.\n4. Compute current sum of the array.\n5. Subtract to find the missing.\n\nDoes that work for all cases?\n\nLet's test another scenario where the missing is the maximum.\n\nExample: nums = [1,2,3,4]. So m=4. n is 5. Expected sum is 15. Array sum is 10. 15-10=5 is missing. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,3,4], which implies n is 4. So expected sum 10. Array sum 9, so missing 1.\n\nWhat about a case where the array isn't missing the first or last, but somewhere in the middle.\n\nLike nums = [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], so m=8. So n=9. Sum expected is 45. Array sum is 1+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = (total without 2). 45 - (sum... 1+3 is 4, +4 is 8, +5=13, etc. Let's calculate: 1+3=4, +4=8, +5=13, +6=19, +7=26, +8=34, +9=43. So the array sum is 43. So missing is 45-43=2.\n\nWait, this seems correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the steps are clear: len(nums) is m, n is m + 1. Sum up the array and subtract from the expected sum, which is (m+1)(m+2)/2.\n\nThat's the approach.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the array is [1,2,4], missing 3.\n\nHere, len(nums) is 3, so n=4. Expected sum is 10. Array sum is 1+2+4=7. Missing 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: when the array is [2,3,4,5], m=4. So n=5. Expected sum 15. Array sum is 2+3+4+5=14. So missing is 1. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems solid.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Calculate the length of the array, m.\n- Compute n = m + 1.\n- Compute expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n- Compute actual_sum = sum(nums)\n- missing = expected_sum - actual_sum\n- return missing.\n\nBut wait, is there any edge cases where this approach may fail?\n\nWhat if the array is [1], missing n? For example, m is 1, n is 2. Expected sum is 3. Array sum is 1. Missing is 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother case: array is [2], so m=1. n=2. Expected sum 3. Array sum is 2. 3-2=1: correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nSo in code, perhaps something like:\n\nm = len(nums)\n\nn = m + 1\n\nexpected = n * (n+1) // 2\n\ncurrent = sum(nums)\n\nreturn expected - current\n\nBut wait, I think that's correct. So the code would be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach is to find the missing number using binary search, as the array is sorted.\n\nBut the sum approach is O(n) time and space, but considering that n can be up to 10^6, it's manageable. Wait, in the problem statement, what's the possible size of nums?\n\nThe sum approach can be O(n), which is acceptable for large arrays as well.\n\nAlternatively, binary search can find it in O(log n) time.\n\nBut for small n, the sum approach is easier to code and understand.\n\nWell, so in code, since the array is already sorted, and the array is missing exactly one element, perhaps we can find the point where the increment is more than 1, and return that.\n\nWait, the array is initially sorted in ascending order. So for example: when the elements are in order, but have a missing in between.\n\nSo in code, iterate through the array, compare current element with previous, see where the gap is larger than 1.\n\nWait, for a sorted array, the first occurrence where nums[i] - nums[i-1] > 1 indicates that the missing element is in that gap. But what if the missing is the first element or the last element.\n\nFor example, [2,3,4,5], the gap after 1 is missing. Wait, the array starts at 2.\n\nHmm, in that case, the first number is 2, and previous number would be 0 (assuming 0 is not part of the array, but perhaps the previous number for the first element is 1).\n\nWait, alternatively, the previous number for index 0 is 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps, check from the beginning.\n\nSet previous = 1.\n\nFor each number in the array:\n\nif num != previous, then the missing is previous.\n\nincrement previous by 1 after each step.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nExample 1: array is [1,2,4,5,6]\n\nprevious starts at 1.\n\nFirst num:1 == previous (1). So previous becomes 2.\n\nSecond num:2 == previous (2). Previous becomes 3.\n\nThird num:4. It's not equal to previous (3). So the missing is 3.\n\nSimilarly, array [1,3,4,5]. Sorted.\n\nprevious starts at 1.\n\nnum is 1: ok, previous 2.\n\nnext num is3. Not equal to 2. So return 2.\n\nAnother example: [2,3,4], m=3.\n\nn is 4.\n\nsorted array is [2,3,4].\n\nprevious starts at 1.\n\nFirst element is 2 !=1: missing is 1.\n\nWait, correct.\n\nAnother example: array [2,3,5], m=3.\n\nprevious starts at1.\n\nnum is2 !=1: missing 1.\n\nBut wait, the array is [2,3,5], the missing should be 4.\n\nWait, Wait no, because according to the problem statement, the array should contain 1..4, but in the array given, this is probably incorrect. Wait no, in this example, m=3: n=4. So the array should be from 1..4, missing one element.\n\nWait in [2,3,5], the elements can't be 5 because for n=4, array can't have 5.\n\nSo perhaps the array is [2,3,4], missing 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps in this case, the binary approach would miss if the missing is early or late.\n\nWait, I think for the problem statement, it's given that the array is a subset of 1 to n, which is of length m =n-1.\n\nSo in the case where the array is [2,3,4], m=3 so n=4, so the array is missing 1.\n\nWait, but the initial approach via sum would correctly compute.\n\nBut for the binary search approach, perhaps the condition needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let's consider the sum approach code.\n\nSo writing code for this.\n\nRead the array, find len(nums) is m. Then n = m+1.\n\nCompute sum and subtract as above.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, it's straightforward.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nnums = [1,2,4,5,6]\n\nm = len(nums) =5\n\nn =5+1=6\n\nsum expected 6*7/2 =21.\n\nsum nums is 1+2+4+5+6=18.\n\nmissing is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nnums = [2,3]\n\nm=2. n=3.\n\nsum expected is 3*4/2=6.\n\nsum nums is 5. so 6-5=1.\n\nThus, code returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nnums = [3,4]\n\nm=2. n=3.\n\nsum=7. 3+4=7. Expected sum is 6. No.\n\nWait what's wrong?\n\nWait wait, n= m+1= 3.\n\nExpected sum is 3*4/2=6.\n\nArray sum is 3+4=7. Then missing is 6 -7 = -1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So what's the error here?\n\nWait, the array given is [3,4], but n is 3. So the expected numbers are 1,2,3, but the array is [3,4], which is longer than m+1. So that can't happen, because the array cannot have elements larger than n.\n\nWait but perhaps in this problem, the given array's elements never exceed n.\n\nWait, because the array is supposed to consist of numbers from 1 to n. So how can an array have element 4 when n=3? It can't.\n\nSo perhaps this scenario is invalid, given the problem constraints.\n\nSo in the problem statement, the given array is such that each of its elements is between 1 and n inclusive, making it a valid array.\n\nThus, cases like [3,4] where m is 2 and 4>3 are invalid, so need not be considered.\n\nSo the sum approach is safe, because in all valid cases, the array contains elements from 1 to n inclusive, with exactly one missing.\n\nThus, the approach would correctly handle all valid cases.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = len(nums) + 1.\n\nsum_total = sum(nums)\n\nexpected = n*(n+1)//2\n\nmissing = expected - sum_total\n\nreturn missing.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nTesting this logic with the examples.\n\nExample1: [1,2,4,5,6], m=5, n=6.\n\nsum_total =1+2+4+5+6=18.\n\nexpected =6*7/2=21.\n\nmissing 3.\n\nCorrect.\n\nExample2: [1,3,4,5], m=4, n=5.\n\nsum_total=13.\n\nexpected 15.\n\nmissing 2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test: array [1,2,3,5,6,7], m=6, n=7.\n\nexpected sum is 7*8//2=28.\n\nsum array:1+2+3+5+6+7=24.\n\nmissing 4.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test: array [1], missing number is 2.\n\nm=1, n=2.\n\nsum is 1, expected 3.\n\nmissing is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code should handle this.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the missing element in a sorted array that contains integers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the array plus one). The array is initially sorted in ascending order but is missing exactly one element.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach leverages the mathematical properties of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Length**: Calculate the length of the given array `nums`, denoted as `m`.\n2. **Calculate `n`**: Since the array is missing one element, the value of `n` is `m + 1`.\n3. **Expected Sum Calculation**: Compute the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n4. **Actual Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the elements in the given array `nums`.\n5. **Find the Missing Element**: Subtract the actual sum from the expected sum. The result is the missing element.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the missing element in linear time, O(n), where `n` is the length of the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(nums):\n    m = len(nums)\n    n = m + 1\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code works as follows:\n\n1. **Determine `m`**: `m` is the length of the given array `nums`, which is missing one element.\n2. **Calculate `n`**: `n` is the total count of elements if none were missing, hence `n = m + 1`.\n3. **Expected Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.\n4. **Actual Sum Calculation**: Sum of the elements in the array `nums` is computed.\n5. **Compute Missing Element**: The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives the missing element.\n\nThis method efficiently and correctly identifies the missing element by leveraging arithmetic properties, ensuring optimal performance.",
