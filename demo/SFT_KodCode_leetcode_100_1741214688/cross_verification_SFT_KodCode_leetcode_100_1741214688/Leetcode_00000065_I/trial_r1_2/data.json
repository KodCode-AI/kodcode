  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, we're given an array of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array. But exactly one element is missing, and the array is initially sorted in ascending order. My task is to find that missing element.\n\nWait, wait. So the array is like 1 to n, but missing one. Oh, but wait, the array's length is n? Wait, no. Wait, the initial array would have been 1 to n, but when one element is missing, the length becomes n-1, right? Because the problem says, the array is given as `nums` which consists of integers from 1 to n. So n is the length of nums? Or no, wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the examples given:\n\nIn the first example, the array is [1,2,4,5,6], which has 5 elements. So n is 5? But the missing element is 3. So 1,2,4,5,6 implies that the original would be 1-6, which is 6 elements. Oh wait, I see now. So the array is missing one element, but its length is n-1, where n is the maximum element or the intended length.\n\nWait no. Wait, the problem says the array consists of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the array. So for example, in the first case, the array is [1,2,4,5,6], and the length is 5. So n is 5. But wait, that array has numbers up to 6, which is higher than n. Then that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"you are given an array nums consisting of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the array.\"\n\nWait, so the array's elements are in the range 1 to n (n is the array's length), but with one element missing. So the array has elements from 1 to n, but one is missing, so the array has size n-1? No, because if n is the array's length, then the elements would have to be 1 to n, but exactly one is missing, so the array's length is (n) - 1? Or is the array's length n-1?\n\nWait, the array is initially sorted in ascending order, and exactly one element is missing. So for example, the array [1,2,4,5,6] has length 5. So n is the length, which is 5. But the array contains numbers up to 6, which is larger than n (5). So that seems to violate the initial statement. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual n is not the same as the array's length. Maybe n is the maximum value that the array should have. Hmm, but the problem says \"n is the length of the array\". Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the example, the array has length 5, but 6 is present, which is larger than 5.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: array is nums, consisting of integers from1 to n inclusive, n is the length of the array.\n\nAh, so the array's elements are 1..n, but missing exactly one. So the array's length would be n-1, right? Because n elements in 1..n, minus one gives n-1 elements. Wait, but in code, if the array's length is, say, 5, then n is 5, and the array should have elements 1,2,3,4,5, missing one. Oh right! So in the example [1,2,4,5,6], the array length must be 6, but wait wait the n is 6. Because in that case, the array is supposed to have 1..6, but it's missing 3. Wait, but the array in that example has elements up to 6, even though the length is 5. So that can't be. I'm getting something wrong here.\n\nLet me re-examine the examples:\n\nFirst example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], missing element is 3. So n is 6? Because the array's length is 5. So the array should have had 6 elements, 1\u20136, but missing one, so it's 5 elements. So n is then 6, which is one more than the array's length.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, \"n is the length of the array\". So in this example, the array's length is 5, so n is 5. But according to the problem, the array should have numbers 1\u20135. But the array has 6, which is beyond n. So this is conflicting.\n\nSo maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n is not the length but the maximum possible value that should be present, and the array's length is n-1 because one element is missing.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says n is the length of the array. So the array's length is n, but it contains elements from 1 to n, inclusive, but exactly one element is missing. But wait, that can't be. Because if the array's length is n, say 5, then it should contain 5 elements. But since it's missing one element from 1\u20135, perhaps some elements are duplicated? But no, because the array is initially sorted and unique.\n\nWait, perhaps no. For example, for array [1,3,4,5], its length is 4. So n is 4. The supposed range is 1\u20134. But the array has 1,3,4,5, which includes 5, which is beyond 4. So this can't be.\n\nHmm, I'm getting this all wrong. Let me maybe approach the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps n is the intended count, so the array's length is n-1 (since one is missing), but the elements are 1 to n, missing one. So for an array of length x, the expected sum is (n)(n+1)/2 minus the missing element. But in this case, n would be the expected total numbers, which is x+1.\n\nWait, let's take the first example. The array is [1,2,4,5,6], which has 5 elements. So n is 6. So the expected sum is 6*7/2 = 21. The actual sum is 1+2+4+5+6=18. So the missing element is 21-18=3. That works.\n\nIn the second example, array is [1,3,4,5], which has 4 elements. So n is 5. Sum should be 15. Actual sum is 1+3+4+5=13. 15-13=2. That works.\n\nSo the approach here is: calculate the sum of the current array, subtract it from the expected total (n*(n+1))/2, and the difference is the missing number.\n\nBut wait, what is n in this case?\n\nSo the array's length is x. Since the array is missing one number, the total count of numbers that should have been present is x+1. Because original array would have (x+1) elements, which are from 1 to x+1. So n is x+1.\n\nTherefore, the missing element is (n*(n+1)/2) - sum(nums), where n is the length of nums plus 1?\n\nWait, let me clarify: let the array be nums, with length m. Then, the array is supposed to contain m+1 numbers from 1 to m+1, with one missing. So n in the formula is m+1 (where m is the length of nums). So expected sum is (m+1)*(m+2)/2, subtract the actual sum, gives the missing element.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFirst example: array length 5.\n\nn = 5+1 =6.\n\nexpected sum 6*7/2=21.\n\nactual sum 18.\n\nmissing is 3: correct.\n\nSecond example: array length 4.\n\nn=5.\n\nsum 15 - 13=2: correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the plan is: compute the sum of the given array, compute the expected sum as (m+1)*(m+2)/2, where m is the array's length, then subtract to find the missing number.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, it's stated that the array is not necessarily contiguous. But for this approach, the array's elements may not be contiguous, but our method assumes that the array should have numbers from 1 to n (m+1). So for example, if the array was [2,3,5,6], which has length 4, the expected sum would be (5)*(6)/2=15. actual sum is 2+3+5+6=16. So 15-16= -1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, no that example can't happen because the problem says exactly one element is missing, from the array, which originally had numbers 1 to n. So all elements must be within 1 to n, and only one is missing. So numbers can't jump beyond n. So the array in this hypothetical [2,3,5,6] can't happen if n is 5. 6 is beyond n=5, but in this situation, n is calc as 4+1=5. So 6 is beyond. Therefore, such an array is invalid according to the problem statement, because one element is missing but others would be beyond n.\n\nWait, but given that the problem says the array is not necessarily contiguous, but only that it's sorted in ascending order, includes elements from 1 to n, missing exactly one.\n\nSo any array given must have all elements between 1 and n, with only one missing. Thus, the first approach is correct.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nCompute the expected sum using (m+1)*(m+2) // 2, subtract the actual sum, and that's the missing element.\n\nAnother method could be using binary search because the array is sorted. Since it's missing one number, the difference between consecutive elements could be 2, indicating that the missing number is in between.\n\nBut for small numbers, the sum method is efficient. However, for larger numbers, the sum approach might not be feasible because of potential integer overflows (but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large so that's not a problem).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to look for where the missing element is by checking the expected element. For example, in a sorted array, the missing element would be where the next element is greater than the previous by more than 1.\n\nSo for i from 0 to len(nums)-2:\n\nif nums[i+1] - nums[i] > 1, then the missing is nums[i] +1.\n\nBut this approach would find the missing element only if the array has no duplicates and contains all elements except one. So for cases where the array is missing the last or first element, this approach would fail.\n\nFor example, array [1,2,3,5], the missing is 4. The code would find 5-3=2, so return 4.\n\nAnother test case: [2,3,4,5], missing 1. The code would not find any i where nums[i+1] - nums[i] >1 since 3-2=1, 4-3=1, 5-4=1. So it misses the missing element. Thus, we need to handle edge cases.\n\nSimilarly, for array [1,3,4,5], missing is 2. So the code would detect 3-1=2>1, detect it, and return 2.\n\nSo this method could work for middle elements but would miss the first and last.\n\nSo perhaps, in addition to checking the middle elements, also check if the first element is not 1, then 1 is the missing. Or check if the last element is not m+1, then it's the missing.\n\nWait, m is the array length, m+1 is n.\n\nSo for array [2,3,4,5], m is 4.\n\nm+1 is 5.\n\nThe last element is 5, which is equal to m+1. So the missing must be 1.\n\nAnother example: array [1,2,4,5,7]. Wait, but wait, according to problem statement, the elements are 1 to n inclusive. So the array can't have 7 if n is 6 (since array length is 5, m=5, n=6). So 7 can't be in the array.\n\nSo in code, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- If the first element is not 1, then the missing is 1.\n- Else if the last element is not m+1, then the missing is m+1.\n- Else, look for the point where next element is previous +2.\n\nSo, for [1,2,4,5], m is 4, n is 5.\n\nLast element is 5 == m+1. So no problem.\n\nThe code would loop through and find that 4-2=2, so missing is 3.\n\nBut for [2,3,4,5], the first element is 2, which is not 1, so missing is 1.\n\nThus, this approach can handle all cases.\n\nWhile both approaches are valid, perhaps the sum approach is easier and straightforward. Let's look at potential edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, but according to problem statement, the array has to be initially sorted and of numbers 1 to n, missing one. So n must be at least 2 because m+1 = n, and m is at least 1.\n\nWait, no, for example, when n=2.\n\nThen the array would be [1], missing 2.\n\nSo the sum method would compute expected sum as 2*(3)/2=3. Actual sum is 1. 3-1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: array is [2], which is missing 1.\n\nSum approach: m=1, expected sum 2*3/2=3. 3 - 2=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the sum approach seems solid.\n\nNow, considering the code.\n\nIn Python, read the array as input. Compute m as len(nums).\n\nn = m +1\n\nexpected = n*(n+1) // 2\n\nactual = sum(nums)\n\nmissing = expected - actual\n\nreturn missing.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's write that.\n\nRead the array. Then:\n\nm = len(nums)\n\nn = m +1\n\nexpected = n * (n+1) // 2\n\nactual = sum(nums)\n\nreturn expected - actual\n\nYes.\n\nLet's test some cases.\n\nFirst example: [1,2,4,5,6], m=5, n=6. sum is 18.\n\nexpected sum 6*7//2 =21.\n\n21-18=3. Correct.\n\nSecond example: [1,3,4,5], m=4. n=5.\n\nsum is 13. expected is 15. 15-13=2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nTest case where array is [2]: missing 1.\n\nexpected sum: 2*3//2=3-2=1. Correct.\n\nTest case [1], missing 2. sum is 1, expected 3. 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,4,5], which would imply m=3, n=4. Sum is 12. expected sum 10 (4*5/2=10). Wait, but sum is 3+4+5=12, which is >10. So 10-12=-2. That can't be.\n\nWait no, that's a problem. Wait, but in the problem statement, the array is allowed to have non-contiguous elements as long as it's from 1 to n. But in this case, the array has 3,4,5, n is 4 (because m=3, n=4=3+1). So 5>4 is invalid. So the array can't have numbers beyond n.\n\nWait, I'm confused again. So according to the problem statement, the array consists of integers from 1 to n, inclusive. So all elements in nums are in [1, n], and exactly one element is missing.\n\nSo in the test case [3,4,5], it's not a valid input since n is 3+1=4, and the array can't have 5.\n\nSo code-wise, as per problem statement, the sum method will always work.\n\nAs for the earlier example in the hypothetical, the array can't exist. So in code, it's safe.\n\nSo the code is safe, correct, and concise.\n\nThus, the final answer is to compute the expected sum as (m+1)(m+2)//2, subtract sum of nums, return the result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the missing element in a sorted array of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array plus one (since one element is missing). \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Constraints**: The array is initially sorted in ascending order and contains all integers from 1 to n except for one missing element. The length of the array is (n-1), where n is the maximum value that should be present in the array if no element was missing.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation Method**: The key insight is to use the mathematical formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). We calculate this expected sum and subtract the actual sum of the given array from it. The result is the missing element.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: This approach inherently handles all edge cases, such as when the missing element is the first or the last element in the intended sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef findMissingElement(nums):\n    m = len(nums)\n    n = m + 1\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Calculate the Expected Sum**: Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, we compute the expected sum of the array if no elements were missing. Here, `n` is the length of the given array plus one because one element is missing, making the maximum possible value in the complete array `len(nums) + 1`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum**: Compute the sum of the elements in the given array.\n\n3. **Find the Missing Element**: The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives us the missing element.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the missing element in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array, by leveraging simple arithmetic operations. This makes it both time and space efficient.",
