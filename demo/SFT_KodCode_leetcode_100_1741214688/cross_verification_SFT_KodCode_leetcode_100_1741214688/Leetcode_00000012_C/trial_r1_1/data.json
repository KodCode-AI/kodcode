  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the maximum profit from trading a stock, but there's a transaction fee involved. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nOkay, the problem statement says that each transaction (buying or selling) incurs a fee. So, every time I sell, I have to subtract that fee from my profit. But when I buy, do I have to pay the fee? Or is the fee only when I sell? Wait, I think the fee is charged per transaction, so buying and selling each would cost the fee. Or maybe the fee is per sell? Oh right, looking back, the sample code uses the fee only when selling. So, maybe the fee is only subtracted when selling. Or wait, let me think again.\n\nIn the sample code provided, during the sell step, the hold variable is added to prices[i] and then subtracted by fee. So yeah, the fee is applied when selling. So each sell transaction costs a fee. So when you decide to sell, you have to pay that fee.\n\nSo the basic idea is to find the best times to buy and sell, considering that every sell transaction reduces the profit by fee. So how can I model this?\n\nI remember in similar problems without the fee, people often use dynamic programming. You keep track of the maximum profit you can have when holding or not holding the stock each day.\n\nLet me think: for each day, I can have two states\u2014either I hold the stock or I don't. So for each state, I track the maximum profit possible.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nhold[i] = the maximum profit up to day i when I hold the stock.\nnot_hold[i] = the maximum profit up to day i when I don't hold the stock.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\nFor hold[i]:\n- I could have bought the stock on day i, which would mean I had not held it the previous day, bought it today. So that's hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], not_hold[i-1] - prices[i]).\n\nWait no, wait. Let me correct that. Because buying is part of the transition.\n\nWait, hold[i] represents the maximum profit when I have the stock at day i. So to get to that state, either I bought it earlier and still hold, or I bought it on day i. So the previous day, I could have either held it or not. If I didn't hold it, I buy it on day i\u2014so profit is not_hold[i-1] - prices[i] (since buying decreases profit by prices[i]). So hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], not_hold[i-1] - prices[i]).\n\nSimilarly, not_hold[i] can be obtained in two ways: either I didn't hold it previously and still don't, or I did hold it and sold it on day i.\n\nIf I sell, then I get the selling price minus the fee. So not_hold[i] = max(not_hold[i-1], hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the transitions are as the sample code is doing.\n\nSo in the code, instead of using arrays, they are using variables to keep track because for each step, you only need the previous day's values.\n\nLet me try to see with some example:\n\nSuppose prices are [1,3,2,8,5], fee=2.\n\nWhat's the expected profit?\n\nLet's simulate it.\n\nInitialize:\n\nhold = -1, not_hold = 0.\n\nDay 1 (price=3):\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-3=-3) \u2192 remains -1.\n\nNot_hold: max(0, (-1)+3-2=0 \u2192 0 is same.\n\nSo hold=-1, not_hold=0.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. But wait, on day 1, I could sell.\n\nWait, perhaps I should step through the example.\n\nWait, another example: maybe the code isn't handling whether to sell multiple times.\n\nHmm, perhaps another example: prices [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 7], fee=2.\n\nLet me walk through it:\n\nInitial hold = -1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=1 (price 3):\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-3=-3) \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, (-1)+3-2=0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\ni=2 (price 2):\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-2=-2 \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, (-1)+2-2 = -1 \u2192 0.\n\ni=3 (price 8):\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-8=-8 \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, (-1) +8 -2 =5 \u2192 so now not_hold becomes 5.\n\ni=4 (price 5):\n\nhold = max(-1, 5-5=0 \u2192 now 0.\n\nnot_hold = max(5, (0)+5-2=3 \u2192 so not_hold remains 5.\n\ni=5 (price 7):\n\nhold = max(0, 5-7 =-2 \u2192 0 remains.\n\nnot_hold = max(5, 0+7-2=5 \u2192 remains 5.\n\nWait but expectedly, when you have a share bought at 1, you could sell at 3, pay fee 2, getting 0. Then buy again at 2 and sell at 8, getting (8-2 +0) profit is 6, minus fee of 2 gives 4. Then maybe buy again at 5 and sell at 7 for 2, total profit 6. Or perhaps the sample walk gives 5.\n\nWait maybe I should recalculate.\n\nWait maybe for this scenario, the best is to buy at 1, sell at 8, profit is 7, minus fee 2 \u2192 5.\n\nThen buy again at 5, sell at 7 \u2192 profit 2, so total 5+2=7.\n\nBut according to the example, the maximum profit is 5.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial sample isn't correct.\n\nWait perhaps the code's initial example where prices are [1,3,2,8,5], fee=2.\n\nOn day 0, hold=-1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=1: price 3.\n\nhold becomes max(-1, 0-3=-3) \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold becomes max(0, (-1+3)-2=0.\n\ni=2: price 2.\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold: max(0, (-1)+2-2 =-1 \u2192 no change.\n\ni=3: price 8.\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-8=-8) \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold: max(0, (-1+8)-2=5 \u2192 so not_hold is 5.\n\ni=4 (price 5):\n\nhold: max(-1, 5-5=0 \u2192 now 0.\n\nnot_hold: max(5, 0+5 -2=3 \u2192 remains 5.\n\nSo overall, not_hold is 5.\n\nWhich corresponds to buying at 1, selling at 8. Profit 7-2=5.\n\nBut if I can buy again at 5, sell at 7, that's 2 profit. No fee in between?\n\nWait, no\u2014each transaction is a buy or sell, but the fee is per sell, I think.\n\nWait, if you have multiple transactions, each sell costs the fee.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal is to buy at 3, sell at 8, and then not do anything else? Because buying at 5, selling at 8 and 5 (maybe the code isn't showing this).\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum is indeed 5. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nIn any case, the code seems to correctly model the problem.\n\nSo the approach is to track hold and not_hold states, for each day, considering the fee when you sell.\n\nSo back to the code.\n\nWait, the code says for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nhold = max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n\nnot_hold = max(not_hold, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nWait, so for each day, you can choose to either hold (perhaps buy it now) or not. But this way, if you already held the stock, you're keeping it, or if you didn't hold, now you do after buying. So it's like considering buying on day i, which means the profit is the previous profit if you didn't hold, minus the price.\n\nHmm. This seems correct.\n\nBut wait, can the hold be updated before or after not_hold? Oh right, because in Python, the new value of hold would overwrite the previous value, and updating not_hold depends on the new value of hold. Or is it?\n\nWait in the code, during each iteration, first the hold is updated, then not_hold.\n\nBut because in each step:\n\nnew_hold = max(current_hold, not_hold_current - prices[i])\n\nnew_not_hold = max(current_not_hold, current_hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nWait wait no, no\u2014because hold is updated first in the code. So perhaps the code is using the updated hold when computing not_hold, but that's incorrect.\n\nBecause in reality, the hold[i] depends on previous state before any updates. So in dynamic programming, when you are calculating i-th step, it's based on (i-1)th step.\n\nWait, so in the code, when you do:\n\nhold = max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n\nthen not_hold is updated based on the new hold. But that can't be right. Because the decision to sell (updating not_hold) should be based on the previous hold value, not the new one.\n\nWait wait, for the same day i, the maximum decisions need to be based on previous day's states.\n\nSo for example, hold and not_hold variables hold the state for day i-1 before processing day i.\n\nSo for day i, the best hold[i] is the maximum of either continuing to hold from day i-1, or buying on day i based on not_hold[i-1].\n\nSimilarly, not_hold[i] is the maximum of either not holding from day i-1, or selling on day i based on hold[i-1] plus price[i] minus fee.\n\nSo in the code, it's iterating over day i, from 1 to end.\n\nEach time, it's computing new hold based on previous hold and previous not_hold.\n\nSimilarly for not_hold, based on previous hold and not_hold.\n\nBut in the code, they do hold = ... first, then not_hold = ... because the new not_hold needs to use the new hold.\n\nWait no, that's wrong. Because when computing the new_hold and new_not_hold, both should be based on the previous state.\n\nOtherwise, using the new hold when calculating not_hold is causing us to use the updated value, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct approach should be to compute both new_hold and new_not_hold in a way that they depend only on the previous hold and not_hold, without being updated.\n\nSo in code, for each i:\n\nprev_hold = hold\n\nhold = max(prev_hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n\nnot_hold = max(not_hold, prev_hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nYes, that's the correct way.\n\nBecause in each step:\n\n- The new hold is either keeping the previous hold, or buying on this day using the previous not_hold.\n\n- The new not_hold is either keeping the previous not_hold, or selling using the previous hold and the current price.\n\nSo in the code, the way hold is updated before not_hold is wrong because in the not_hold calculation, it uses the new hold. So it's using same day's computations in other variable's calculation.\n\nThat's a mistake.\n\nWait let's consider an example. Suppose we have prices [1, 2]. Fee is 0.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nInitially, hold = -1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=1, price 2.\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192 -1 remains.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, (-1)+2-0=1 \u2192 so not_hold becomes 1.\n\nWhich gives the correct profit of 1.\n\nBut according to that code, it's correct.\n\nBut wait, let's check another example with fee.\n\nWait let's say prices [1,3], fee=1.\n\nIf you buy on day 0, sell on day 1, you make 3-1-1=1 profit.\n\nSo the code:\n\nhold = -1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=1:\n\nhold is max(-1, 0-3)=-1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, (-1 +3 -1)=1 \u2192 so 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn this case, the code is correct even though hold is updated first. But perhaps in more complex situations, the order matters.\n\nWait another example: prices [2,4,1,5], fee=1.\n\nLet me walk through with the correct approach and the original code.\n\nThe correct approach should compute both hold and not_hold based on the same variables as of day 1, then update.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\ni starts at 1.\n\nInitial hold = -2, not_hold=0.\n\nDay 1 (price=4):\n\nCompute new_hold as max(hold, not_hold - 4 = max(-2, 0-4=-4) \u2192 -2.\n\nCompute new_not_hold as max(0, hold+4 -1)= max(0, (-2)+3=1 \u2192 1.\n\nSo after day1: hold is -2, not_hold is1.\n\nNow, day2 (price=1):\n\nCompute new_hold: max(-2, 1-1=0 \u2192 new_hold is 0.\n\nCompute new_not_hold: max(1, (-2)+1 -1= -2 \u2192 no change.\n\nSo now, hold=0, not_hold=1.\n\nDay3 (price=5):\n\nnew_hold: max(0, 1-5=-4): 0.\n\nnew_not_hold: max(1, 0+5 -1=4 \u2192 4.\n\nSo not_hold becomes 4.\n\nSo the maximum profit is 4.\n\nWhich makes sense: buy at 2, sell at 4, profit is 2 (4-2) but fee is 1, so 1 profit. Then wait, why is the maximum 4?\n\nWait maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOption 1: buy at 2, sell at 4 \u2192 profit 2, fee 1 = 1.\n\nOption 2: buy at 2, sell at 5 \u2192 profit 3, fee 1 = 2.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, profit is 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps another option where I buy at 1 and sell at 5.\n\nWait, the decision to buy at 1 would be better?\n\nWait in our initial example, the prices [2,4,1,5].\n\nSo:\n\n- Day 0: buy at 2.\n\nDay 1: can sell at 4 \u2192 profit 2, fee 1 \u2192 1.\n\nNot_hold after day1 is 1.\n\nThen, day2: buy again? Because not_hold is 1.\n\nWait not_hold is 1 at day2, as per the calculation. So buying at price 1 would cost 1, profit is not_hold - price.\n\nSo hold is 0 = max(-2, 1-1=0).\n\nThen, day3: sell at 5.\n\nProfit for selling is 0 +5 -1=4.\n\nSo profit is 1 (from first sell) plus 4 (from second sell) \u2192 but wait, are both sells accounted for in not_hold?\n\nOr no, because each sell is a single operation. So I think the approach is correct.\n\nWait, in any case, the correct way is to use the previous state for both updates. So in code, the way to do that is by computing new_hold and new_not_hold using the previous values of hold and not_hold, and then updating them.\n\nSo the bug in the original code is that it updates hold first, and then uses the updated hold to compute not_hold. Which is wrong.\n\nBecause, for example, if during day i, after hold is updated, not_hold is computed based on the new hold value. But hold's new value may have changed due to buy/spread, which is not how the problem should be handled.\n\nSo in the initial code, the way they're updating hold first and then using it to compute not_hold is incorrect. It's using the same day's hold value when it should use the previous.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to compute both new_hold and new_not_hold based on the original (previous) hold and not_hold, then update the variables.\n\nSo perhaps the original code is wrong and will not handle some cases correctly.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the code:\n\nhold = max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n\nnot_hold = max(not_hold, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nSo when processing day i:\n\n- After processing hold, the hold variable is updated.\n\nThen, not_hold is computed using the new hold.\n\nThis is incorrect, as not_hold should be using the hold before the update.\n\nSo for instance, in the example where hold is updated based on not_hold subtracting the price, and then not_hold is computed with the new hold.\n\nThis can lead to considering a sell on the same day after buying within the same step.\n\nWhich is impossible, because you can't buy and sell on the same day.\n\nWait, but in one day, you cannot buy and sell. So in the transitions, can you buy and sell on the same day? Hmm, in some variations, you cannot, but the code seems to allow it.\n\nWait, no\u2014because the initial hold is updated as the max of existing hold or new possible hold (buying now). Then not_hold is computed based on existing or selling now. So, in effect, for the same day, you can't sell immediately after buying because the time flows from buy to sell.\n\nBut in the code, since both are based on the same updating step, perhaps it's allowing you to buy then sell on the same day.\n\nWhich is not possible in actual trading.\n\nSo perhaps another issue is that the code allows for same-day buy and sell.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's allowed? Or not.\n\nHmm, in any case, the code needs to be adjusted to compute new_hold and new_not_hold based on the previous values.\n\nSo, in code, we need to compute them in such a way that for time i, the updating of hold and not_hold depends only on their values from time i-1.\n\nSo the correct way is:\n\nprev_hold = hold\n\nprev_not_hold = not_hold\n\nhold = max(prev_hold, prev_not_hold - prices[i])\n\nnot_hold = max(prev_not_hold, prev_hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nSo in the code, the hold and not_hold are only ever based on their previous state.\n\nTherefore, the correct code would first compute the new values using the previous variables.\n\nSo, perhaps the original code is incorrect in this aspect.\n\nThus, the initial code has a bug because it's using the updated hold when computing not_hold during the same step.\n\nSo perhaps the correct code is:\n\nWe need to compute hold_new and not_hold_new using hold_old and not_hold_old.\n\nThen, after computing both, we set hold = hold_new and not_hold = not_hold_new.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    new_hold = max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n    new_not_hold = max(not_hold, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n    hold, not_hold = new_hold, new_not_hold\n\nSo that way, both new_hold and new_not_hold are based on the previous values.\n\nTesting this with the previous example:\n\nprices = [2,4,1,5], fee=1.\n\ni=1: price=4.\n\nprev_hold = -2.\n\nprev_not_hold = 0.\n\nnew_hold = max(-2, 0-4=-4) \u2192 -2.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, -2+4-1=1) \u21921.\n\nThus, hold is now -2, not_hold is 1.\n\ni=2: price=1.\n\nnew_hold = max(-2, 1-1=0 \u2192 0.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(1, -2 +1-1=-2 \u2192 1.\n\nso hold=0, not_hold=1.\n\ni=3: price=5.\n\nnew_hold = max(0, 1-5=-4 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold= max(1, 0+5-1=4). So not_hold=4.\n\nSo the maximum is 4, which makes sense: you buy on day 0, price 2; don't sell on day1; buy again on day2 when price is 1; sell on day3, price5.\n\nWait, but wait, can you buy on day2 when you had sold on day1? Or wait: in the code, can you re-buy on the next day after selling.\n\nOh wait, yes. Because not_hold is 1 after day 1 (sold for 1), then on day 2, you can buy again.\n\nSo in this case:\n\nBuy on day0: 2.\n\nHold. Then on day2, buy again: price 1.\n\nBecause not_hold was 1 after day1, which is day2 in 0-based.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should have a correction in how hold and not_hold are updated.\n\nIn the original code, because hold is updated before not_hold, it creates a situation where not_hold is computed based on the updated hold, which is incorrect.\n\nSo to fix the code, we need to compute the new values based on the old variables.\n\nSo in code:\n\nKeep track of current hold and not_hold.\n\nFor each day after the first:\n\nnew_hold = max of either keeping the current hold or buying now (using previous not_hold - price).\n\nnew_not_hold = max of either keeping current not_hold or selling now (current hold + price - fee).\n\nOnly then update the hold and not_hold to the new values.\n\nSo in the initial code, the bug is that it's updating hold first, thus the not_hold is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct code should compute new_hold and new_not_hold as per the previous variables, then update.\n\nTherefore, the corrected code will fix this bug.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nprices = [1,3,2,8,5,7], fee=2.\n\nLet's manually compute what the maximum should be.\n\nWe need to see what's the optimal trading.\n\nOption: buy at 1, sell at 8. Profit is 7-2=5.\n\nThen buy again at 5, sell at7 for 2- gives a profit of 2. So total 7.\n\nWait, but the code is ensuring that we do this?\n\nWait, let's compute the code without and with the correction.\n\nOriginal code (with updating hold first):\n\nInitially, hold=-1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=1 (3):\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-3=-3) \u2192 -1.\n\nnot_hold: max(0, (-1)+3-2=0) \u21920.\n\nSo hold remains -1, not_hold 0.\n\ni=2 (2):\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-2=-2 \u2192-1.\n\nnot_hold remains max(0, (-1)+2-2=-1 \u21920.\n\ni=3 (8):\n\nhold: max(-1, 0-8=-8 \u2192-1.\n\nnot_hold: max(0, (-1)+8-2=5 \u21925.\n\ni=4 (5):\n\nhold: max(-1,5-5=0 \u21920.\n\nnot_hold: max(5, 0+5-2=3 \u21925.\n\ni=5 (7):\n\nhold: max(0,5-7=-2 \u21920.\n\nnot_hold: max(5, 0+7-2=5 \u21925.\n\nSo code returns 5.\n\nBut according to manual calculation, you could make 5 profit from the first sell, and then 2 from the second sell, totaling 7.\n\nSo the code would miss the second transaction, giving 5.\n\nBut with the corrected code, perhaps it's captured.\n\nLet me recompute with the corrected approach where hold and not_hold are computed based on previous state.\n\nAt i=5 (price=7):\n\nprev_hold is 0, prev_not_hold is5.\n\nnew_hold = max(0, 5-7=-2 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(5, 0+7-2=5 \u21925.\n\nSo no change.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nWait in the first place, after i=3, where you have 5 in not_hold, which indicates you sold the stock on day3.\n\nAt i=4, which is price 5:\n\nCalculating new_hold:\n\nmax(0, 5-5=0 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold: max(5, 0+5-2=3 \u21925.\n\nThus, hold remains 0 (same as before? No.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait during i=4 (price 5):\n\nprev_hold is 0 (from i=3 processing), prev_not_hold is 5.\n\nnew_hold = max(0, 5 -5=0 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(5, 0+5-2=3 \u21925.\n\nSo hold becomes 0, not_hold remains5.\n\nThen on i=5, price7:\n\nnew_hold = max(0, 5 -7=-2) \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(5, 0 +7 -2=5) \u21925.\n\nThus, in the corrected code, the maximum remains 5.\n\nBut according to my manual calculation, it would allow for another buy at 5 and sell at7.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nWait in the initial setup, can you buy the stock on day4 after selling on day3?\n\nYes.\n\nWait on day4: prev_hold is 0 (from selling on day3). prev_not_hold is5 (day3 after selling).\n\nSo when is day4:\n\nHold[i] is:\n\nmax(prev_hold (0), prev_not_hold (5) -5 =0 \u2192 0.\n\nNot_hold[i] is:\n\nmax(5, prev_hold (0) +5 -2=3 \u21925.\n\nSo on day4, you can buy the stock for 5, if you have not held it before.\n\nBecause on day4, your not_hold is5, which allows you to buy again.\n\nSo why is the not_hold[i] 5, and the new_profit when selling at 7 is 5.\n\nBecause on day5, when processing:\n\nnew_hold is max(0 (hold on day4), 5 (previous not_hold) -7= -2 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold is max(5, (hold on day4) 0 +7-2=5.\n\nSo no change.\n\nThus, the code is not able to capture the second transaction.\n\nHmm. So what is the correct approach?\n\nThis suggests that the current approach, even with the corrected computation, is not capturing all possible transactions, perhaps due to the way it greedily buys or sells.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way the code is designed, it can't do multiple transactions beyond two.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP approach is correct and my manual calculation is wrong.\n\nBecause in the scenario above:\n\nBy buying at1, selling at8 (profit 5), then buy at5, sell at7 (profit 2), the total is 7.\n\nWhich is better than 5.\n\nSo why isn't the code capturing that?\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the code's logic does not allow multiple transactions beyond two buys/sells.\n\nWait maybe the way the code is structured can handle multiple transactions.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nLooking at the definition of hold and not_hold:\n\nAt each step, for hold, you can choose to buy or not buy. For not_hold, you can choose to sell or not.\n\nSo, the code allows for multiple transactions, with the fee taken each time.\n\nSo the buy and sell can happen on different days.\n\nSo why in the earlier example, it does not find the additional profit?\n\nLet me manually recompute the correct way with code.\n\nFor the prices [1,3,2,8,5,7], fee=2.\n\nInitialize:\n\nhold = -1 (buy on day0)\n\nnot_hold=0.\n\ni=1 (price=3):\n\nprev_hold = -1.\n\nprev_not_hold=0.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-3=-3) = -1.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, (-1)+3-2=0 \u21920.\n\nhold=-1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=2 (price=2):\n\nprev_hold = -1.\n\nprev_not_hold=0.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-2= -2 \u2192-1.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, -1+2 -2= -1 \u21920.\n\nSo new state: hold=-1, not_hold=0.\n\ni=3 (price=8):\n\nprev_hold=-1, prev_not_hold=0.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1, 0-8=-8 \u2192-1.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, (-1) +8-2=5 \u21925.\n\nso now, hold=-1, not_hold=5.\n\ni=4 (price=5):\n\nprev_hold=-1, prev_not_hold=5.\n\nnew_hold = max(-1,5-5=0 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold= max(5, (-1)+5 -2=2 \u21925.\n\nNow, hold=0, not_hold=5.\n\ni=5, price=7:\n\nprev_hold=0, prev_not_hold=5.\n\nnew_hold = max(0, 5-7 =-2 \u21920.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(5, 0+7 -2=5 \u21925.\n\nThus, the maximum is not_hold=5.\n\nBut according to manual computations, it's possible to get 7.\n\nWait, that can't be.\n\nWhat's the issue here.\n\nAh, because in day4, the hold is 0, which indicates that you can hold the stock bought on day4 (price5). And on day5, you can sell at 7, getting 2 profit after fee.\n\nBut why isn't this reflected in the new_not_hold?\n\nBecause on day5, the new_not_hold is computed as 0 +7 -2=5. So compared to initial not_hold=5, thus doesn't change.\n\nWhich suggests that the profit after selling on day5 is5, which is same as the current maximum.\n\nSo the maximum profit is5, not 7.\n\nHmm, then what is the correct maximum here?\n\nWait, perhaps in this example, the profit from the two sells is 5.\n\nWait, initially on day3: sold for 8, got 5.\n\nThen buy on day4:5.\n\nSell on day5:7-2=5 (but 7-5=2, subtract fee 2. So 0. Oh wait, the profit is 7-5-2=0.\n\nSo why is the not_hold still increasing.\n\nWait no: the sell on day5 is adding 7 -2 (fee) to hold on day4, which is0.\n\n7-2=5. So 0+5=5, which creates a not_hold of 5, comparing to current not_hold 5. So it stays.\n\nSo the maximum is indeed5.\n\nIn this case, the second sell does not add more.\n\nBut wait, the initial sell gives 5, and buy/sell again doesn't add any profit. So the code is correct.\n\nSo my manual calculation is wrong.\n\nThe thought that the two sells would add 5 and 2 total is incorrect because the fee is subtracted each time.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst transaction: buy1, sell at8:8-1=7. Minus fee 2:5.\n\nSecond tranascrion: buy5, sell7: makes 2. Minus fee2: 0. No profit.\n\nThus, total is5.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case where multiple transactions are possible:\n\nprices = [2,1,2,0,1], fee=2.\n\nWhat is the profit?\n\nLet's do step by step.\n\nInitial: hold-2, not_hold0.\n\ni=1 price=1:\n\nhold = max(-2, 0-1= -1 \u2192-1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, -2 +1 -2= -3 \u21920.\n\ni=2 price=2:\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-2=-2) \u2192-1.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, -1 +2 -2= -1 \u21920.\n\ni=3 price=0:\n\nhold = max(-1, 0-0=0 \u21920.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, -1 +0-2 =-3 \u21920.\n\ni=4 price=1:\n\nhold = max(0, 0-1=-1 \u21920.\n\nnot_hold = max(0, 0 +1 -2=-1 \u21920.\n\nSo maximum is0.\n\nBut:\n\nIs there a way to make a profit? Let's see.\n\nNo, because every possible sale yields a loss:\n\nFor example:\n\nBuy at1, sell at1: no profit. Deduct fee.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother example.\n\nprices = [3,2,6,5,0,3], fee=2.\n\nWhat's the maximum.\n\nLet me manually compute.\n\nI think the optimal is:\n\nBuy at2, sell at6: profit4-2=2.\n\nThen, buy at0, sell at3: 3-0-2=1.\n\nTotal profit3.\n\nComputing via the code:\n\ninitialize: hold=-3 (buy3?), no, wait initial is -3 (buy day0).\n\nn=6.\n\ni=1 to5.\n\ni=1: price=2.\n\nnew_hold = max(-3, 0-2=-2) \u2192max(-3,-2)= -2.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, (-3)+2-2=-3 \u21920.\n\nso now, hold=-2.\n\ni=2: price6.\n\nnew_hold = max(-2, 0-6=-6 \u2192-2.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(0, (-2)+6-2=2 \u21922.\n\ni=3: price5.\n\nnew_hold = max(-2, 2-5=-3 \u2192-2.\n\nnew_not_hold = max(2, (-2)+5-2=1 \u21922.\n\ni=4: price=0.\n\nnew_hold= max(-2, 2-0=2 \u21922.\n\nnew_not_hold= max(2, -2+0-2=-4 \u21922.\n\ni=5: price3.\n\nnew_hold= max(2,2 -3 =-1 \u21922.\n\nnew_not_hold= max(2, 2 +3-2=3 \u21923.\n\nSo max is3, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code can correctly find multiple transactions.\n\nThus, the error in the initial code is that hold is updated first, and then used when computing not_hold. So in the correct code, it should compute both based on the previous hold and not_hold, and then update.\n\nThus, to correct the code, hold and not_hold are new variables, based on the previous state.\n\nSo the final code should:\n\nInitialize hold and not_hold.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncompute new_hold as max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n\ncompute new_not_hold as max(not_hold, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n\nthen, set hold = new_hold and not_hold = new_not_hold.\n\nThus, the code in Python would be structured like:\n\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if not prices:\n        return 0\n    hold = -prices[0]\n    not_hold = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n        new_hold = max(hold, not_hold - prices[i])\n        new_not_hold = max(not_hold, hold + prices[i] - fee)\n        hold, not_hold = new_hold, new_not_hold\n    return max(not_hold, hold)\n\nWait, but the maximum profit can be achieved whether you're holding or not.\n\nIn some cases, the maximum profit could be in the hold state if selling on the last day is not optimal.\n\nBut in the problem statement, you can't have any pending stock at the end. Or can you?\n\nWait, the problem statement says you have to compute the maximum profit. So you can have as many transactions as possible, including zero.\n\nBut since we end when trading is done, the end can be either holding or not.\n\nWait, no. Because, transactions are phased as buy and sell.\n\nIf you end up holding, that means you still have a stock, which didn't contribute to the profit, unless you sell.\n\nBut the problem statement allows choosing when to sell, so you need to sell at least once to get a profit.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for maximum profit. So for example, if on the last day, you decide to hold because selling would give you a lower profit.\n\nBut wait, in that case, not selling would mean you're keeping the stock but your profit isn't increased.\n\nSo no, the maximum is the maximum between hold and not_hold at the end.\n\nBut not_hold implies that you sold already.\n\nSo perhaps, in the end, the not_hold is the maximum.\n\nBut in some cases, for example, if the last day's price is very high, but without any sell, it's notHold all the way.\n\nBut since the code considers whether to sell or not on each day, the last step could be to sell, thus getting the maximum.\n\nBut it's possible that the hold state is higher.\n\nWait, let me think: can the hold state on the last day be better than the not_hold?\n\nOnly if you have no transactions and no profit.\n\nBut in the code, for example:\n\nIf the prices are strictly decreasing. So you don't buy at all.\n\nSo initially, the hold variable is -prices[0]. But on each step, you don't buy.\n\nNot_hold remains 0.\n\nSo the code would return 0.\n\nThe hold would stay at -prices[0], which is worse than0.\n\nSo in that case, the maximum is 0.\n\nThus, when the prices are decreasing, the maximum profit is0, which means no transactions.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother scenario where on the last day, not selling is better:\n\nprices = [1,2,1], fee=1.\n\nDay1: sell at2 for 2-1-1=0.\n\nDay2: price 1: hold is max(0 (from buying day1?), not_hold (0) -1= -1: so hold remains 0.\n\nnot_hold is max(0, 0+1-1=0. So no change.\n\nThus, maximum is0.\n\nAlternatively, could have bought day0, and hold on days1 and 2.\n\nProfit would be 1-1 + any changes? Hmm, not better.\n\nSo yes, the code correctly returns0.\n\nThus, in the code, after all the iterations, the maximum profit is either hold or not_hold.\n\nBut since selling is the only way to get profit (because hold implies you have a stock that may contribute to losses if you keep it), probably the not_hold is the maximum profit.\n\nBut to be safe, since the final decision can be to hold or not, depending on the situation, the code should return max(hold, not_hold).\n\nBut in reality, the hold is the profit if you choose to keep the stock at the end. Which would never be optimal, since that means you didn't sell, hence no profit from that last transaction.\n\nBut for example, if the last price is the highest, you should sell.\n\nThus, perhaps the maximum is not_hold.\n\nIn the original code, it's returning not_hold.\n\nBut looking back at the example where prices = [1,3], fee=1.\n\nThe maximum is1, which is whether you sold on day3.\n\nSo the maximum is not_hold.\n\nThus, generally, the maximum profit is not_hold.\n\nBut perhaps to include the case where it's better to sell on the last day, but through not_hold.\n\nThus, in the code, it returns not_hold as the maximum.\n\nThus, to summarize, the corrected code must:\n\n- Use new variables to compute hold and not_hold based on previous state.\n\n- Iterate through each price.\n\n- Keep track of max profit.\n\nThus, the final code is as described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit achievable from trading a stock while accounting for a transaction fee associated with each sale. The solution involves using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve when either holding the stock or not holding it at each point in time.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves maintaining two states at each day:\n1. **Holding the stock (hold):** This state keeps track of the maximum profit if we have the stock on the current day. This can either be from holding it previously or buying it on the current day.\n2. **Not holding the stock (not_hold):** This state keeps track of the maximum profit if we do not have the stock on the current day. This can either be from not holding it previously or selling it on the current day.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Initialize `hold` to the negative of the first stock price (assuming we buy the stock on the first day) and `not_hold` to 0 (no profit if we start without holding the stock).\n2. Iterate through each stock price starting from the second day.\n3. For each day, update the maximum profit for holding and not holding the stock based on the previous day's states.\n4. Return the maximum profit, which is the maximum value between the two states after processing all days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef maxProfitWithTransactionFee(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:\n    if not prices:\n        return 0\n    \n    hold = -prices[0]  # Assume we buy on the first day\n    not_hold = 0       # No stock in hand\n    \n    for price in prices[1:]:\n        new_hold = max(hold, not_hold - price)\n        new_not_hold = max(not_hold, hold + price - fee)\n        hold, not_hold = new_hold, new_not_hold\n    \n    return max(hold, not_hold)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization:** Start by assuming we buy the stock on the first day, so `hold` is initialized to `-prices[0]`. If we do not hold the stock initially, `not_hold` is 0.\n2. **Iteration:** For each subsequent day, calculate the potential maximum profit if we decide to buy the stock (updating `hold`) or sell the stock (updating `not_hold`).\n3. **State Updates:** For each day, `new_hold` is the maximum of holding the stock previously or buying it today. `new_not_hold` is the maximum of not holding the stock previously or selling it today and subtracting the transaction fee.\n4. **Result:** After processing all days, the maximum profit is the highest value between holding the stock or not holding it on the last day.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the optimal decisions using constant space, making it suitable for large lists of stock prices.",
