You are allowed to perform the following operation on the array any number of times:\n\n- Choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n` and set `nums[i]` to `0`.\n\nYou are also given a **0-indexed** array `costs` of the same length, where `costs[i]` represents the cost of setting `nums[i]` to `0`. \n\nYour goal is to make all elements in `nums` equal to `0` with the minimum possible cost. \n\nReturn _the minimum cost to achieve this_.",
