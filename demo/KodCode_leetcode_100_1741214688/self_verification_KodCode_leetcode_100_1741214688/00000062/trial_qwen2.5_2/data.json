  "instruction": "Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, you can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\n- Choose any two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) where `0 <= i < j < s.length` and `s[i] = 'a'` and `s[j] = 'z'`. Reverse the substring `s[i+1..j-1]`.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the string `s` into a string where all characters are the same. If it is impossible to achieve such a string, return `-1`.\n\nFor example, given the string `s = \"azbzczbzcz\"`, you can perform the following operations:\n1. Choose `i = 0` and `j = 1` to get `s = \"aabzczbzcz\"`.\n2. Choose `i = 2` and `j = 3` to get `s = \"aaazbzczcz\"`.\n3. Choose `i = 4` and `j = 5` to get `s = \"aaaaaaazcz\"`.\n4. Choose `i = 6` and `j = 7` to get `s = \"aaaaaaaazz\"`.\n5. Choose `i = 8` and `j = 9` to get `s = \"aaaaaaaaaz\"`.\n\nReturn `5` as the answer.",
