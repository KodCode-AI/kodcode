  "instruction": "Given a list of strings `words` and a string `target`, you need to find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to arrange the strings in `words` such that they form the `target` string. Each string in `words` can only be used once, and the order of the strings in `words` must match the order of the strings in `target`. A swap is defined as exchanging the positions of two adjacent strings in the list. Please return the minimum number of swaps required to achieve the `target` string. If it is not possible to arrange the strings in `words` to form the `target` string, return `-1`.\n\nFor example, given `words = [\"abc\",\"def\",\"ghi\"]` and `target = \"defabcghi\"`, the minimum number of swaps required is `2`. First, swap \"abc\" and \"def\", then swap \"def\" and \"ghi\". Therefore, the answer is `2`.",
