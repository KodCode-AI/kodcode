  "instruction": "Given two integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency` both of length `n`, and an integer `k`, you are to select a subset of engineers to form a team. Each engineer is represented by their `speed` and `efficiency`. Your goal is to maximize the **product** of the team's **average speed** and the minimum efficiency among the selected engineers. The team must consist of at least `2` engineers. Return the maximum possible product. Since the answer can be a large number, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.",
