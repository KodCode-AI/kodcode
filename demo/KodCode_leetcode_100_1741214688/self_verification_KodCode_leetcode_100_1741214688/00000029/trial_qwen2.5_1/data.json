  "instruction": "You are given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`. A **substring** of `s` is considered **balanced** if the number of `0`s and `1`s in it are equal. You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose any index `i` in the string `s` and flip the character at `i` (i.e., change `'0'` to `'1'` and vice versa). Your task is to find the length of the **longest balanced substring** you can obtain by performing the above operation **at most** `k` times. Return the length of this longest balanced substring.\n\nFor example, if `s = \"1100011\"` and `k = 2`, you can flip the characters at indices `4` and `6` to get `\"1101111\"`, which contains a balanced substring of length `7`.",
