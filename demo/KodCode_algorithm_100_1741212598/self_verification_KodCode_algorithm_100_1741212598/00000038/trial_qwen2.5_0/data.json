  "instruction": "**Problem Statement**:\nYou are given a sequence of integers. Your task is to implement a function to generate all possible subsequences of the given sequence using a backtracking algorithm. The function should print each subsequence in a separate line.\n\n**Input**:\n- A non-empty list of integers, `sequence`, where the length of the list is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).\n\n**Output**:\n- Print all possible subsequences of the given sequence, each on a new line. Ensure that the subsequences are printed in lexicographical order.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nsequence = [1, 2, 3]\nOutput:\n[]\n[1]\n[1, 2]\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 3]\n[2]\n[2, 3]\n[3]\n```\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of `sequence` is between 1 and 10.\n- The elements in `sequence` are integers between 1 and 100.\n\n**Performance Requirement**:\n- Your solution should run efficiently for sequences of length up to 10.\n\n**Implementation**:\nImplement the function to generate and print all possible subsequences of the given sequence.\n\n```python\ndef generate_all_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints all possible subsequences of the given sequence using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \n    :param sequence: A list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your implementation here\n```",
