  "instruction": "You are tasked with implementing and utilizing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to solve a specific problem. Given two integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), your task is to find integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\cdot m + b \\cdot n = \\gcd(m, n)\\). Additionally, you need to use these coefficients to construct a new integer \\(k\\) such that \\(k = a^2 + b^2\\). \n\nHere are the requirements for your implementation:\n- **Input**: Two integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) (\\(-10^9 \\leq m, n \\leq 10^9\\)).\n- **Output**: A single integer \\(k\\) as described above.\n- **Performance Requirement**: Your solution should be efficient and handle the given constraints within a reasonable time.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\n# Example 1\nm = 10\nn = 6\n# Extended Euclidean Algorithm: 10 = 1*6 + 4, 6 = 1*4 + 2, 4 = 2*2 + 0\n# Bezout's identity: 10*(-1) + 6*2 = 2 (gcd of 10 and 6 is 2)\n# k = (-1)^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\n# Output: 5\n\n# Example 2\nm = 35\nn = 15\n# Extended Euclidean Algorithm: 35 = 2*15 + 5, 15 = 3*5 + 0\n# Bezout's identity: 35*(-3) + 15*7 = 5 (gcd of 35 and 15 is 5)\n# k = (-3)^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58\n# Output: 58\n```\n\n### Implementation\n\nWrite a function `calculate_k(m: int, n: int) -> int` that takes two integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) as input and returns the integer \\(k\\) as described above.\n\n### Constraints\n- \\( -10^9 \\leq m, n \\leq 10^9 \\)\n\n### Note\n\nEnsure your implementation is correct by handling all edge cases and optimizing the solution to handle large inputs efficiently.",
