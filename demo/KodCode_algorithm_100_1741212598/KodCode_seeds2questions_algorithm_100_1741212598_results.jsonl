The function `energy_conversion` takes three parameters: `from_type`, `to_type`, and `value`, and returns the converted value.\n- **Complexity**: The function is primarily concerned with arithmetic operations, which are constant time and space operations.\n- **Principles**: The function uses a dictionary `ENERGY_CONVERSION` to map energy units to their corresponding values in joules. It then performs a simple division operation to convert the value from one unit to another.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: The function is designed to handle a wide range of energy units and performs basic arithmetic operations.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This function is useful in scientific and engineering applications where energy values need to be converted between different units.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: The main strength is its simplicity and effectiveness in handling unit conversions. However, it lacks error handling for invalid units, which can lead to incorrect results or exceptions.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle invalid input types and invalid unit values gracefully.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The function has a constant time and space complexity, so performance is not a concern.\n- **Error Scenarios**: The function should raise appropriate exceptions for invalid input unit types.\n- **Optimization Points**: None necessary as the function is already straightforward and efficient.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are given a function `energy_conversion` that converts energy units. The function uses a dictionary to map different energy units to their corresponding values in joules. Your task is to extend this function to handle more complex cases and improve its robustness.\n\n**Task**:\n1. Modify the `energy_conversion` function to handle a new unit: \"electronvolt_per_photon\". The conversion factor for this unit is defined as `1 electronvolt_per_photon = 6.241509074460763e+15 joules`.\n2. Add a feature to allow users to convert from \"electronvolt_per_photon\" to any other unit and vice versa.\n3. Improve error handling to provide more informative error messages when invalid units are provided.\n4. Ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion of \"electronvolt_per_photon\" and includes appropriate test cases in the docstrings.\n\n**Input and Output**:\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `from_type`: A string representing the unit to convert from.\n  - `to_type`: A string representing the unit to convert to.\n  - `value`: A numeric value to convert.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - A float representing the converted value.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The function must support the new unit \"electronvolt_per_photon\" in both directions (from and to).\n- The function must provide an informative error message when invalid units are provided.\n\n**Performance Requirements**:\n- The function should handle conversions efficiently with a time complexity of O(1).\n\n**Scenario**:\nYou are working on a project to convert energy values between various units, and you need to incorporate the conversion of \"electronvolt_per_photon\". The function should be robust and provide clear error messages for any invalid unit conversions.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\n>>> energy_conversion(\"electronvolt_per_photon\", \"joule\", 1)\n6.241509074460763e+15\n>>> energy_conversion(\"joule\", \"electronvolt_per_photon\", 6.241509074460763e+15)\n1.0\n>>> energy_conversion(\"electronvolt_per_photon\", \"wattsecond\", 1)\n0.00016402208664101444\n>>> energy_conversion(\"wattsecond\", \"electronvolt_per_photon\", 0.00016402208664101444)\n1.0\n```\n\n**Note**:\n- You must include appropriate test cases in the docstrings to demonstrate the functionality of the updated `energy_conversion` function.\n- Ensure that the function raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message when an invalid unit is provided.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000000", "row_id": 0, "seed_ids": [648], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Insertion Sort is used for small subarrays to optimize performance.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: It is in-place and does not require additional space, except for the recursion stack.\n- **Common Use Cases**: Ideal for sorting large datasets that do not fit into memory or where randomness is important to avoid worst-case performance.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: It provides good average-case performance and is stable for both large and small datasets. However, it can be less efficient for very small arrays due to the overhead of recursive calls.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: Empty arrays, arrays with one element, and arrays with repeated elements.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The partitioning phase can be slow if the pivot is not chosen well.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect sorting order due to poor pivot selection or incorrect recursive depth handling.\n- **Optimization Points**: Use of insertion sort for small subarrays, efficient pivot selection, and handling edge cases properly.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n**Problem Statement**:\nYou are tasked with implementing a sorting algorithm that uses Introspective Sort. Introspective Sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that provides good average-case performance and is particularly useful for sorting large arrays. Your task is to complete the `intro_sort` function to ensure the algorithm works correctly and efficiently.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```python\ndef intro_sort(array: list, start: int, end: int, size_threshold: int, max_depth: int) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the array between indices `start` and `end` (inclusive) using Introspective Sort.\n    \n    :param array: The array to be sorted\n    :param start: The starting index of the subarray to sort\n    :param end: The ending index of the subarray to sort\n    :param size_threshold: The threshold size at which insertion sort is used\n    :param max_depth: The maximum depth of recursion before switching to Heap Sort\n    :return: The sorted subarray\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- `array`: A list of integers to be sorted.\n- `start`: The starting index of the subarray to sort.\n- `end`: The ending index of the subarray to sort.\n- `size_threshold`: The threshold size at which insertion sort is used.\n- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of recursion before switching to Heap Sort.\n\n**Output**:\n- A sorted subarray.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of `array` is between 1 and 10,000.\n- The indices `start` and `end` are valid and `start <= end`.\n\n**Examples**:\n```python\n# Example 1\narray = [4, 2, 6, 8, 1, 7, 8, 22, 14, 56, 27, 79"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000001", "row_id": 1, "seed_ids": [206], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Your task is to implement a function `advanced_encrypt` that enhances the existing encryption algorithm by adding support for handling non-alphabetic characters and improving performance. Additionally, you need to implement a function `advanced_decrypt` that decrypts the text using the same key.\n\n#### Function Specifications\n1. **advanced_encrypt(key: str, text: str) -> str**\n   - **Input**:\n     - `key`: A string representing the encryption key.\n     - `text`: A string representing the plaintext to be encrypted.\n   - **Output**:\n     - A string representing the encrypted text.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - The key should only contain alphabetic characters.\n     - The text can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.\n     - The text should be converted to uppercase before encryption.\n   - **Performance Requirement**: The function should handle large texts efficiently.\n\n2. **advanced_decrypt(key: str, cipher_text: str) -> str**\n   - **Input**:\n     - `key`: A string representing the decryption key.\n     - `cipher_text`: A string representing the ciphertext to be decrypted.\n   - **Output**:\n     - A string representing the decrypted text.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - The key should only contain alphabetic characters.\n     - The `cipher_text` should already be in uppercase.\n\n#### Implementation Steps\n1. Modify the `generate_table` function to handle non-alphabetic characters in the key.\n2. Implement the `advanced_encrypt` and `advanced_decrypt` functions to handle non-alphabetic characters and improve performance.\n3. Ensure that the functions are efficient and handle large inputs effectively.\n\n#### Example\n```python\nkey = \"marvin\"\ntext = \"jessica!123\"\n\n# Encrypted text\nencrypted_text = advanced_encrypt(key, text)\n# Decrypted text\ndecrypted_text = advanced_decrypt(key, encrypted_text)\n\nprint(f\"Encrypted: {encrypted_text}\")\nprint(f\"Decrypted: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\n#### Expected Output\n```\nEncrypted: QRACRWU!123\nDecrypted: JESSICA!123\n```\n\n#### Note\n- Make sure to handle all possible edge cases, such as empty strings or keys with non-alphabetic characters.\n- Optimize the code to handle large texts efficiently.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000006", "row_id": 6, "seed_ids": [65], "mode": "algorithm"}}

If there is a cycle in the linked list,\nthe fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer and they will\nmeet at the same node.

The primary function `solution` checks for Lychrel numbers below a specified limit.\n- **Complexity**:\n  - **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n \\cdot m)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of iterations (50 in this case) and \\(m\\) is the number of numbers being checked (up to 10,000). The `is_palindrome` and `sum_reverse` functions are called \\(n \\cdot m\\) times.\n  - **Space Complexity**: \\(O(m)\\) for storing the list of Lychrel numbers.\n- **Principles**:\n  - The `is_palindrome` function checks if a number is a palindrome by converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse.\n  - The `sum_reverse` function performs the reverse and add operation.\n  - The `solution` function iterates through each number below the limit, performing the reverse and add process up to 50 times, and checks if the result is a palindrome. If not, the number is considered a Lychrel number.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**:\n  - The process of checking if a number is a palindrome is straightforward and efficient.\n  - The reverse and add process is simple but can be computationally intensive for large numbers.\n- **Common Use Cases**:\n  - This function is used to identify Lychrel numbers, which are theoretical and not practically encountered in many real-world applications.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**:\n  - **Strengths**: It correctly identifies Lychrel numbers and handles the reverse and add process efficiently.\n  - **Limitations**: The function is limited to a fixed number of iterations (50), which may not be sufficient for extremely large numbers. It also lacks optimization for extremely large numbers or more complex scenarios.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - The function should handle numbers with leading zeros correctly.\n  - It should correctly handle the reverse and add operation for numbers with an odd number of digits.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**:\n  - The function performs the reverse and add process multiple times for each number, which can be slow for large numbers.\n  - Converting numbers to strings for palindrome checks can be slow for very large numbers.\n- **Error Scenarios**:\n  - Incorrectly identifying a number as a Lychrel number if the reverse and add process reaches the limit of 50 iterations.\n  - Incorrectly identifying a number as not a Lychrel number if a palindrome is formed within the 50 iterations.\n- **Optimization Points**:\n  - Optimizing the reverse and add process for large numbers.\n  - Reducing the number of iterations if a palindrome is formed earlier.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Coding Question\n\n#### Context\nA Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the reverse and add process within a specified number of iterations. The reverse and add process involves reversing the digits of a number and adding it to the original number.\n\n#### Problem\nYou are given a function `solution(limit: int = 10000)` that identifies Lychrel numbers below a specified limit. The function iterates through each number, performing the reverse and add process up to 50 times to check if a palindrome is formed. If not, the number is considered a Lychrel number.\n\nYour task is to implement an optimized version of the `solution` function that can handle larger limits more efficiently. Specifically, optimize the function to handle numbers up to \\(10^8\\) and determine how many Lychrel numbers exist within this range.\n\n#### Requirements\n1. **Input**:\n   - A single integer `limit` representing the upper limit for checking Lychrel numbers (e.g., `limit = 100000000` for the range up to 99999999).\n2. **Output**:\n   - Return the count of Lychrel numbers below the given limit.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - \\(1 \\leq \\text{limit} \\leq 10^8\\).\n4. **Performance**:\n   - The solution should be efficient and handle the given constraints within a reasonable time.\n\n#### Example\n```python\ndef solution_optimized(limit: int) -> int:\n    # Your optimized solution here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage\nlimit = 100000000\nprint(f\"{solution_optimized(limit) = }\")\n```\n\n#### Hints\n- Consider optimizing the reverse and add process for larger numbers.\n- Explore ways to reduce the number of iterations if a palindrome is formed earlier.\n- Optimize string conversion and palindrome checks for performance.\n\n#### Note\nProvide a thorough explanation of the optimizations implemented in your solution.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000010", "row_id": 10, "seed_ids": [589], "mode": "algorithm"}}

**Complexity**: Time complexity is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of steps (in this case, 1000). Space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) as it does not require additional space proportional to the input size.\n- **Principles**: The Simpson's integration method approximates the definite integral by summing up the weighted values of the function at equally spaced points. It uses the formula \\(\\int_a^b f(x) dx \\approx \\frac{h}{3} [f(x_0) + 4 \\sum_{i=1,3,5,...} f(x_i) + 2 \\sum_{i=2,4,6,...} f(x_i) + f(x_n)]\\), where \\(h = \\frac{b-a}{n}\\).\n\n#### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: The method is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule for smooth functions. It is based on the idea that the function can be approximated by a parabola between three points.\n- **Common Use Cases**: Effective for functions that are smooth and continuous over the interval. It is particularly useful in numerical analysis and scientific computing.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: Strengths include its higher accuracy compared to simpler methods like the trapezoidal rule. Limitations include the requirement for a smooth function, and it may not perform well for functions with sharp changes or discontinuities.\n\n#### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - The function values at points \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_n\\) are directly used, so ensure they are defined.\n  - The step \\(h\\) should be small enough to achieve the desired precision, but not so small as to cause unnecessary computational overhead.\n  - Ensure that the function provided to `simpson_integration` returns valid numeric values.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The loop iterating over the points can be slow if the function is computationally expensive.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect function implementation or incorrect handling of precision can lead to inaccurate results.\n- **Optimization Points**: Reducing the number of steps can speed up the computation, but at the cost of accuracy. Implementing a more adaptive step size based on the function's behavior can balance accuracy and performance.\n\n### Question Style\nThe question should be challenging and require a well-thought-out coding solution.

The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of dimensions. This is because the function iterates through each dimension once.\n- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\), as the function uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\n**Principles**:\n- The function calculates the distance by iterating over the coordinates of the two points and summing the absolute differences.\n- It validates the input to ensure that both points are lists of numbers and have the same number of dimensions.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**:\n- **Properties**: The Manhattan distance is not a true Euclidean metric because it uses the sum of absolute differences rather than the square root of the sum of squared differences. It is translation-invariant and follows the Manhattan (city block) grid.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This distance measure is often used in scenarios where movement is restricted to a grid-like structure, such as in chess (Knight's moves), urban planning, and certain types of pathfinding algorithms.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: It is simple to compute and easy to understand. However, it may not reflect the shortest path in Euclidean space, which can be a limitation in some applications.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle cases where one or both points are not provided, or where the points are not lists, or where the points have different dimensions.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The performance is efficient as it only involves iterating through the dimensions, but it could be optimized to use more concise syntax.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect results can occur if the input validation is not properly handled, leading to type or value errors.\n- **Optimization Points**: The function can be optimized by combining the validation and distance calculation into a single line, as shown in `manhattan_distance_one_liner`.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are required to implement a function that calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in an n-dimensional space.

Elements are removed in FIFO order from their respective queues.\n  - **ElementPriorityQueue**: Elements are added to a single queue, and the element itself is its priority. The element with the highest value (lowest priority) is removed first.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**:\n  - **FixedPriorityQueue**:\n    - Uses multiple queues for different priorities.\n    - Each priority queue is managed independently.\n    - Supports FIFO order for each priority level.\n  - **ElementPriorityQueue**:\n    - Single queue for all elements.\n    - Elements are managed based on their inherent value.\n- **Common Use Cases**:\n  - **FixedPriorityQueue**: Useful in systems where tasks need to be prioritized but processed in a fixed order within each priority level.\n  - **ElementPriorityQueue**: Suitable for scenarios where elements are naturally ordered by their value, and the lowest value needs to be processed first.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**:\n  - **FixedPriorityQueue**:\n    - **Strengths**: Allows for prioritization within each priority level, ensuring that urgent tasks are processed before less urgent ones.\n    - **Limitations**: Can be complex to manage multiple queues, and adding elements to the queue is more cumbersome.\n  - **ElementPriorityQueue**:\n    - **Strengths**: Simple and intuitive, straightforward to implement.\n    - **Limitations**: Does not support prioritization within the same value.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - Both queues can raise `OverFlowError` when the maximum size is exceeded.\n  - `UnderFlowError` can be raised when `dequeue` is called on an empty queue.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**:\n  - Dequeue operations in `ElementPriorityQueue` can be slow due to the `min` function call and `remove` operation.\n- **Error Scenarios**:\n  - Invalid priorities in `FixedPriorityQueue` can lead to `ValueError`.\n- **Optimization Points**:\n  - Use of more efficient data structures like `heaps` can improve performance, especially for `ElementPriorityQueue`.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Scenario\nYou are developing a system where tasks need to be processed based on their priority and a custom scoring mechanism. You have been provided with a `FixedPriorityQueue` and an `ElementPriorityQueue`. Your task is to implement a new `CustomPriorityQueue` that combines the functionalities of both queues. The `CustomPriorityQueue` should handle tasks based on the following rules:\n\n1. Tasks are added to the queue based on a score, as in `ElementPriorityQueue`.\n2. The queue should support multiple priority levels, similar to `FixedPriorityQueue`.\n3. When a task is processed, it should follow a mixed strategy: first, tasks are processed by priority level in the order of their priority (highest to lowest), and within each priority level, tasks are processed in FIFO order.\n4. The queue should support the following operations:\n   - `enqueue(priority: int, score: int)`: Add a task to the queue with the given priority and score.\n   - `dequeue()`: Remove and return the task with the highest priority (and score if priorities are the same), following FIFO within each priority level.\n\n### Constraints\n- The queue should handle up to 100 tasks.\n- The priority levels are integers from `0` to `2`.\n- The score is an integer.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- The `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations should run in `O(log N)` time complexity.\n\n### Expected Output\n```python\ncq = CustomPriorityQueue()\ncq.enqueue(0, 10)\ncq.enqueue(1, 15)\ncq.enqueue(2, 20)\ncq.enqueue(0, 12)\ncq.enqueue(1, 14)\ncq.enqueue(2, 22)\nprint(cq)  # Output: Priority 0: [10, 12], Priority 1: [15, 14], Priority 2: [20, 22]\nprint(cq.dequeue())  # Output: 10\nprint(cq)  # Output: Priority 0: [12], Priority 1: [15, 14], Priority 2: [20, 22]\nprint(cq.dequeue())  # Output: 12\nprint(cq)  # Output: Priority 0: [], Priority 1: [15, 14], Priority 2: [20, 22]\nprint(cq.dequeue())  # Output: 15\n```\n\n### Implementation\nWrite a class `CustomPriorityQueue` that meets the above requirements and includes methods for `enqueue` and `dequeue`.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000015", "row_id": 15, "seed_ids": [386], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The problem involves numerical stability and the use of large numbers.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This type of problem is common in competitive programming and mathematical puzzles where large numbers and specific patterns need to be checked.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: The use of modulo arithmetic helps in avoiding overflow for large Fibonacci numbers.

The `check` function is called multiple times, and the `tocheck` array may lead to unnecessary computations.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect handling of large numbers can lead to incorrect results. The modulo operation is crucial but must be applied correctly.\n- **Optimization Points**: The use of modulo arithmetic and pre-computing the `tocheck` array can be optimized. Additionally, more efficient ways to check pandigital properties can be explored.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nYou are given a problem to find the first Fibonacci number that is pandigital (contains all digits 1 to 9) both in the first nine digits and the last nine digits. The sequence is defined as:\n\n\\[\nF_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\n\\]\n\nwith initial conditions \\(F_1 = 1\\) and \\(F_2 = 1\\).\n\n**Task**:\nImplement a function `find_pandigital_fibonacci` that returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that meets the criteria. If no such number exists within the first 1,000,000 Fibonacci numbers, return -1.\n\n#### Constraints:\n- The function should handle large numbers efficiently.\n- The function should be optimized for performance.\n\n#### Input and Output:\n- **Input**: None (the function should use predefined variables and constants).\n- **Output**: An integer representing the index of the first pandigital Fibonacci number.\n\n#### Example:\n```python\n# Example input (no explicit input needed, use predefined values)\nprint(find_pandigital_fibonacci())  # Output: 329468\n```\n\n#### Helper Functions:\nYou are allowed to use helper functions if needed. The provided `check` and `check1` functions can be used but are not mandatory.\n\n#### Implementation:\n```python\ndef find_pandigital_fibonacci() -> int:\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n\ndef check(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check function for pandigital properties\n    pass\n\ndef check1(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check function for pandigital properties from end\n    pass\n```\n\n### Requirements:\n- The function `find_pandigital_fibonacci` should be efficient and optimized for large inputs.\n- Use modulo arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n- The solution should be able to handle the large number of Fibonacci numbers specified.\n\n### Scoring:\n- Correct implementation and performance: 100 points.\n- Partial implementation: Partial points based on correctness and efficiency.\n- Incorrect or inefficient implementation: 0 points.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000017", "row_id": 17, "seed_ids": [609], "mode": "algorithm"}}

It also includes a `cosine_similarity` function to calculate the cosine similarity between vectors. The main purpose of the `similarity_search` function is to find the nearest vector in a dataset to a given vector or vectors and calculate the distance between them.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm has a time complexity of \\(O(n \\times m)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of vectors in the dataset and \\(m\\) is the number of vectors in the `value_array`. This is because for each vector in `value_array`, the function iterates through the entire `dataset` to find the nearest vector.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) for the `euclidean` function, but the `similarity_search` function uses additional space to store the results, which is \\(O(k \\times 2)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of vectors in `value_array`.\n\n**Principles**:\n- The core operational steps involve calculating the Euclidean distance between each vector in the `value_array` and all vectors in the `dataset`, and then selecting the vector with the smallest distance.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n\n**Properties**: The Euclidean distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space, and it is sensitive to the scale of the data.\n\n**Common Use Cases**: This function is useful in scenarios where you need to find the closest match in a dataset, such as in natural language processing, recommendation systems, and similarity searches in high-dimensional spaces.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**: Simple to implement, easy to understand, and widely used in various applications.\n- **Limitations**: Computationally expensive for large datasets, especially if the dataset is high-dimensional. It may not be the best choice for sparse data or when the data is non-linearly distributed.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- If the dimensions of the vectors in the `dataset` and `value_array` are different, an error will be raised.\n- If the shapes of the vectors are different, an error will be raised.\n- If the data types of the vectors are different, an error will be raised.\n\n**Performance Bottlenecks**:\n- The main bottleneck is the nested loop that calculates the Euclidean distance for each pair of vectors. This can be optimized using more efficient algorithms like KD-trees or Ball trees for large datasets.\n\n**Error Scenarios**:\n- If the input data has different dimensions, shapes, or data types, the function will raise appropriate exceptions.\n\n**Optimization Points**:\n- Instead of calculating the Euclidean distance for each pair of vectors in the nested loop, a more efficient approach would be to use data structures like KD-trees or Ball trees to reduce the number of distance calculations.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Scenario\n\nYou are working on a natural language processing project where you need to find the most similar document to a given query document based on the Euclidean distance between their vector representations. The dataset contains vector representations of several documents, and you need to write a function to find the closest document to a given query document.\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou are to implement the `find_closest_document` function that takes a dataset of documents and a query document, and returns the closest document to the query based on Euclidean distance.

This algorithm uses a simple polynomial rolling hash function with a specific magic constant (5381).\n\n**Core Identification**:\n- **Algorithm**: djb2 hash algorithm.\n- **Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of space.\n- **Principles**: The algorithm transforms each character of the string into a hash value by shifting and adding the hash value with the ASCII value of the character.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**:\n- **Properties**: The hash function is not guaranteed to be collision-free. It is efficient and easy to implement, but the hash values can collide for different strings.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This algorithm is often used in hash tables, in-memory databases, and for quick lookups.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: Its simplicity and speed make it a good choice for applications where the risk of collisions is low. However, it may not be suitable for cryptographic purposes due to its simplicity.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles all ASCII characters within the standard range. However, it may not work correctly with strings containing non-ASCII characters.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The algorithm is linear in time complexity, so for very large strings, the performance can degrade.\n- **Error Scenarios**: If the input string contains non-ASCII characters, the algorithm will not behave as expected. Incorrect handling of string lengths or special characters can lead to incorrect hash values.\n- **Optimization Points**: While the algorithm is efficient, using a different magic constant or implementing a more complex hash function might provide better performance and fewer collisions.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are tasked with enhancing the djb2 hash algorithm to handle non-ASCII characters and to ensure that the generated hash values are consistent across different runs. Additionally, the function should support a configurable magic constant to allow for testing with different hash functions.\n\n**Task**: Implement a Python function `enhanced_djb2` that takes a string `s` and an optional `magic_constant` (default is 5381) as input and returns the hash value. The function should handle non-ASCII characters correctly and ensure that the hash value is consistent. The function should also support a configurable magic constant.\n\n**Input**:\n- `s`: A string (input to be hashed).\n- `magic_constant`: An integer (default is 5381) representing the magic constant used in the hash function.\n\n**Output**:\n- An integer representing the hash value.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of the string `s` will not exceed 1000 characters.\n- The `magic_constant` will be a positive integer.\n\n**Performance Requirements**:\n- The function should be able to handle large strings efficiently.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\n>>> enhanced_djb2('Algorithms')\n3782405311\n\n>>> enhanced_djb2('scramble bits', 33)\n1609059040\n\n>>> enhanced_djb2('\u975eASCII', 5381)\n756778245\n```\n\n**Note**: Non-ASCII characters should be properly encoded using their ASCII values or Unicode code points, and the hash function should produce consistent results.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000019", "row_id": 19, "seed_ids": [417], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The main limitation is the potential for incorrect results if the digit cancellation logic is not implemented correctly.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle cases where the digits are not correctly cancelled, such as when the digits are zero or when the fraction becomes trivial.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The nested loops in `fraction_list` can be slow for larger digit lengths. Care must be taken to avoid unnecessary calculations and optimize the logic.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect digit cancellation logic can lead to incorrect results.

A digit-cancelling fraction is one where a digit in the numerator and the denominator can be incorrectly cancelled, yet the resulting fraction still equals the original fraction (e.g., 49/98 = 4/8).\n\nYour task is to extend this functionality to generate a list of such non-trivial digit-cancelling fractions for fractions with three-digit numerators and denominators. Additionally, compute the product of the denominators of these fractions in their lowest terms.\n\n### Input and Output Formats\n\n- **Input**: An integer `n` (2 or 3) representing the number of digits in the numerator and denominator.\n- **Output**: A single integer representing the product of the denominators of the valid non-trivial digit-cancelling fractions, in their lowest terms.\n\n### Constraints and Limitations\n\n- The input `n` will be either 2 or 3.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\n- The solution should be efficient and handle the specified constraints within a reasonable time frame.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\ndef solution(n: int) -> int:\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage\nprint(solution(2))  # Output: 90\nprint(solution(3))  # Output: [Your output]\n```\n\n### Additional Instructions\n\n- Ensure the logic for digit cancellation is correct.\n- Handle edge cases such as fractions where the digit cancellation leads to zero denominators.\n- Simplify the final product of denominators to its lowest terms.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000020", "row_id": 20, "seed_ids": [554], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The main algorithm utilized here is the combination of the `abundant` and `semi_perfect` functions.\n- **Complexity**:\n  - `factors`: O(\u221an) for each call, where n is the input number.\n  - `abundant` and `semi_perfect`: Both functions use a dynamic programming approach with a complexity of O(n) for each number.\n- **Principles**:\n  - `factors` computes all divisors of a given number.\n  - `abundant` checks if the sum of proper divisors of a number is greater than the number itself.\n  - `semi_perfect` checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of some of its divisors (excluding the number itself).\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**:\n  - `factors` returns a sorted list of all divisors.\n  - `abundant` and `semi_perfect` use dynamic programming to solve their respective problems.\n- **Common Use Cases**:\n  - These functions are used in number theory and algorithmic challenges related to divisor sums and subset sums.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**:\n  - Strengths: Efficient and clear implementation of key number theoretical properties.\n  - Limitations: The current implementation might be slow for very large numbers due to the use of dynamic programming in `abundant` and `semi_perfect`.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - The `factors` function should handle the case where the input is 1, which has only one divisor.\n  - The `abundant` function should handle the case where the input is 0, which is considered abundant.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**:\n  - The `abundant` and `semi_perfect` functions have a quadratic time complexity due to the use of dynamic programming methods.\n  - The `semi_perfect` function can be optimized by using a more efficient subset sum algorithm.\n- **Error Scenarios**:\n  - The `abundant` function might return incorrect results if the sum of proper divisors is not correctly calculated.\n- **Optimization Points**:\n  - Use a more efficient subset sum algorithm in `semi_perfect` to improve performance.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are working on a project that involves identifying weird numbers. A weird number is a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect. An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. A semiperfect number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of some of its divisors (excluding the number itself).\n\nGiven a list of natural numbers, write a function `find_weird_numbers` that returns a list of all weird numbers from the input list. Ensure that your function is efficient and handles edge cases properly.\n\n#### Input and Output Formats\n- **Input**:\n  - A list of integers `numbers` (1 \u2264 len(numbers) \u2264 1000), where each number is in the range 1 \u2264 number \u2264 10000.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - A list of integers representing the weird numbers in the input list.\n\n#### Constraints and Limitations\n- The input list can contain up to 1000 numbers.\n- Each number in the list is in the range 1 to 10000.\n\n#### Performance Requirements\n- Your function should be able to handle the input within a reasonable time, ideally under 1 second for the given constraints.\n\n#### Example\n```python\n>>> find_weird_numbers([69, 70, 71])\n[70]\n>>> find_weird_numbers([12, 18, 20, 24, 25])\n[20, 24]\n```\n\n#### Scenario/Context\nYou are working on a number theory project and need to identify weird numbers in a given list of natural numbers. Your function should be efficient and handle the edge cases properly.\n\n<|Question End|>\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_weird_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n```"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000022", "row_id": 22, "seed_ids": [792], "mode": "algorithm"}}

This algorithm does not use any data structure but operates directly on strings.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The function iterates through the string and performs bit operations.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the binary string generated from the hexadecimal input.\n\n**Principles**:\n- The function first cleans the input by stripping leading and trailing whitespace.\n- It checks for a negative sign and handles it separately.\n- The function converts the cleaned hexadecimal string to an integer using base 16.\n- It then repeatedly divides the integer by 2 and records the remainder, which builds the binary representation from right to left.\n- Finally, it returns the binary string, possibly prefixed with a negative sign if the original input was negative.\n\n**Properties**:\n- The function supports both positive and negative hexadecimal values.\n- It can handle leading and trailing whitespace.\n- It raises a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid hexadecimal number.\n\n**Common Use Cases**:\n- Converting hexadecimal data to binary for further processing in applications that require binary representations.\n- Data conversion in networking protocols that might use hexadecimal and need binary representations.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**: Handles whitespace and negative values gracefully. It correctly handles all valid hexadecimal inputs.\n- **Limitations**: The function does not support hexadecimal characters that are not in the range 0-9 and A-F (or a-f). It does not perform any error-checking for invalid characters beyond that.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - Handling whitespace (handled by stripping).\n  - Handling negative numbers (handled correctly).\n  - Handling invalid inputs (handled via `try-except` block).\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: \n  - The while loop that repeatedly divides the number by 2 can be optimized further.\n- **Error Scenarios**: \n  - Invalid hexadecimal characters (not handled beyond the `ValueError`).\n- **Optimization Points**: \n  - Use bitwise operations more efficiently to convert the integer to binary.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nDesign a function `hex_to_bin_optimized` that converts a given hexadecimal string to its binary representation.

The application should support a custom ROT13 variant where the shift value is configurable. Your task is to extend the provided code to include a function that can handle this custom ROT13 variant and a main function to test the functionality.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Implement a function `custom_dencrypt(s: str, n: int = 13) -> str` that takes a string `s` and a positive integer `n` as input and returns the string encrypted or decrypted using the ROT13 variant with a shift of `n`.\n2. The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly, and non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.\n3. Include a `main` function to test the `custom_dencrypt` function with the following requirements:\n   - It should prompt the user to enter a message.\n   - It should display the encrypted message using a specified shift value.\n   - It should display the decrypted message after applying the encryption again with the same shift value.\n4. Ensure that the shift value `n` is positive and does not exceed 26. If the shift value is invalid, your function should handle it gracefully and provide a meaningful error message.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    s0 = input(\"Enter message: \")\n\n    try:\n        shift = int(input(\"Enter shift value (1-26): \"))\n        if 1 <= shift <= 26:\n            s1 = custom_dencrypt(s0, shift)\n            print(\"Encryption:\", s1)\n\n            s2 = custom_dencrypt(s1, shift)\n            print(\"Decryption: \", s2)\n        else:\n            print(\"Shift value must be between 1 and 26.\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 26.\")\n```\n\n### Constraints\n\n- The input string can contain up to \\(10^5\\) characters.\n- The shift value \\(n\\) should be a positive integer between 1 and 26, inclusive.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\n- The solution should be able to handle the encryption and decryption of a string of up to \\(10^5\\) characters within a reasonable amount of time.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000026", "row_id": 26, "seed_ids": [66], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Your implementation should maintain the case of the original message and should correctly handle the keyword wrapping for each character.\n\n### Requirements:\n- **Input**:\n  - `key`: A string representing the encryption/decryption key.\n  - `message`: A string representing the message to be encrypted or decrypted.\n  - `mode`: A string that is either `\"encrypt\"` or `\"decrypt\"`.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - Return the translated message as a string.\n\n- **Constraints**:\n  - The key can consist of any alphanumeric characters.\n  - The message can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation marks.\n  - The `LETTERS` string includes all uppercase and lowercase English letters, as well as digits.\n\n### Example:\n```python\n# Example 1: Encryption\nkey = 'HDarji'\nmessage = 'This is Harshil Darji from Dharmaj.'\nmode = 'encrypt'\ntranslate_message(key, message, mode)  # Output: 'Akij ra Odrjqqs Gaisq muod Mphumrs.'\n\n# Example 2: Decryption\nkey = 'HDarji'\nmessage = 'Akij ra Odrjqqs Gaisq muod Mphumrs.'\nmode = 'decrypt'\ntranslate_message(key, message, mode)  # Output: 'This is Harshil Darji from Dharmaj.'\n```\n\n### Implementation:\n```python\nLETTERS = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 .,!?\"\n\ndef encrypt_message(key: str, message: str) -> str:\n    return translate_message(key, message, \"encrypt\")\n\ndef decrypt_message(key: str, message: str) -> str:\n    return translate_message(key, message, \"decrypt\")\n\ndef translate_message(key: str, message: str, mode: str) -> str:\n    # Your implementation here\n```\n\n### Submission:\n- Ensure your implementation is efficient and handles all specified requirements and examples correctly.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000027", "row_id": 27, "seed_ids": [63], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Padding is required for the final block, using '=' characters, which can be a minor overhead in certain applications.\n  - It is not as compact as base64 encoding, which means it may use more characters to represent the same amount of data.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n**Edge Cases**: \n- Handling of non-printable characters in the input data.\n- Proper padding and unpadding in the decoders.\n- Ensuring the character set is correctly used for both encoding and decoding.\n\n**Performance Bottlenecks**: \n- String manipulations like zfill, join, and strip can be costly operations.\n- The decoding process involves converting characters back to binary, which can be slow if not optimized.\n\n**Error Scenarios**: \n- Incorrect padding can lead to decoding errors.\n- Invalid characters in the Base32 string can cause decoding to fail.\n\n**Optimization Points**: \n- Precomputing the binary to character and character to binary mappings can speed up the process.\n- Minimizing the use of string operations by preprocessing and postprocessing the data.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are tasked with implementing a more efficient version of the Base32 encoding and decoding functions.

The overall complexity is approximately \\(O(\\text{ants\\_num} \\times \\text{iterations\\_num} \\times \\text{cities\\_num}^2)\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(\\text{cities\\_num}^2)\\) for the pheromone matrix and \\(O(\\text{ants\\_num} \\times \\text{cities\\_num})\\) for storing the routes of ants.\n\n**Principles**:\n- The algorithm simulates the behavior of ants finding the shortest path between cities. It uses pheromones to guide the search, where pheromone levels increase for shorter paths and decrease over time.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n\n**Properties**:\n- **Stochastic**: The solution is probabilistic as it relies on random selections.\n- **Self-organizing**: Pheromone trails guide the search, allowing dynamic adjustment of the solution.\n- **Heuristic-based**: It uses heuristic information (distance) to guide the search process.\n\n**Common Use Cases**:\n- **Optimization**: Particularly useful in solving optimization problems like TSP where the goal is to find the shortest possible route.\n- **Real-world applications**: In logistics, planning, and resource allocation.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**: Robust to local optima, can handle large problem sizes, and provides a good initial solution.\n- **Limitations**: Computationally intensive, may not always converge to the exact optimal solution, and sensitive to parameters like alpha and beta.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- **Empty City List**: The algorithm should handle cases where the city list is empty.\n- **Single City**: The algorithm should handle the case where there is only one city.\n\n**Performance Bottlenecks**:\n- **Large Cities**: The algorithm's performance can degrade for a very large number of cities due to the \\(O(\\text{cities\\_num}^2)\\) space complexity.\n- **Parameter Tuning**: Proper tuning of parameters like alpha, beta, and q is critical for the algorithm's performance.\n\n**Error Scenarios**:\n- **Index Out of Range**: Ensure that indices are within the bounds of the city and pheromone matrices.\n- **Division by Zero**: Ensure that division by zero does not occur in the probability calculations.\n\n**Optimization Points**:\n- **Parallelization**: The algorithm can be parallelized to speed up the computation for large numbers of cities.\n- **Evaporation Rate**: Adjust the pheromone evaporation rate to balance exploration and exploitation.\n- **Pheromone Initialization**: Better initialization of pheromone values can improve the initial solution quality.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Problem Description\n\nYou are tasked with implementing an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Given a list of cities along with the distances between each pair of cities, your goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Implement the `main` function that takes the city coordinates, the number of ants, the number of iterations, pheromone evaporation rate, alpha, beta, and q, and returns the best path and the total distance.\n- Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as empty city lists and single cities.\n- The input and output formats are as described in the provided code snippet.\n- The function should be efficient and handle large numbers of cities.\n\n### Constraints\n\n- \\(1 \\leq \\text{cities\\_num} \\leq 100\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq \\text{ants\\_num} \\leq 100\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq \\text{iterations\\_num} \\leq 100\\)\n- \\(0 \\leq \\text{pheromone\\_evaporation} < 1\\)\n- \\(1 \\leq \\alpha, \\beta, q \\leq 100\\)\n\n### Example\n\n```python\ncities = {\n    0: [0, 0],\n    1: [0, 5],\n    2: [3, 8],\n    3: [8, 10],\n    4: [12,"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000036", "row_id": 36, "seed_ids": [1034], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The comb sort algorithm is a simple yet effective improvement over bubble sort, which sorts a list of elements in ascending order by comparing elements with a certain gap. The gap in comb sort starts with the length of the list and is reduced by a shrink factor until it becomes 1.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a few limitations and edge cases that need to be handled more robustly. Your task is to modify the given comb sort function to handle these issues and improve its performance.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. **Input**: A list of integers.\n2. **Output**: The same list sorted in ascending order.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The list can contain up to 100,000 elements.\n   - Elements can range from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.\n4. **Performance**: The function should be efficient, aiming for a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\) in the worst case.\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. Modify the `comb_sort` function to handle edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists.\n2. Optimize the gap reduction strategy to improve the sorting efficiency.\n3. Ensure the function correctly handles sorting large lists with a high number of duplicates.\n\n### Example\n\n```python\n# Example usage\nunsorted = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]\nsorted_list = comb_sort(unsorted)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n```\n\n### Additional Constraints\n\n- You should not use any external libraries or built-in sorting functions.\n- The code should be clear, well-documented, and easy to understand.\n\n### Provided Code\n\n```python\ndef comb_sort(data: list) -> list:\n    # Your implementation here\n    return data\n```\n\n### Task\n\nImplement the `comb_sort` function according to the requirements and constraints provided. Make sure to handle all edge cases and optimize the sorting algorithm to perform efficiently.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000044", "row_id": 44, "seed_ids": [224], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Correct the signs of the coefficients if the original \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) were negative.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: The algorithm is based on repeated application of the division algorithm and back-substitution. It is a very efficient method for finding the coefficients of Bezout's identity.\n- **Common Use Cases**: Commonly used in cryptography, particularly in algorithms like RSA for finding modular inverses.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**:\n  - **Strengths**: Efficient and straightforward.\n  - **Limitations**: The algorithm assumes that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers.

The space complexity is also \\(O(n)\\), as a new array of the same size is created and filled with the output values.\n- **Principles**: The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that takes any real number as input and maps it to a value between 0 and 1, which is often used in machine learning and neural networks for normalization purposes.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: The sigmoid function is a smooth and differentiable function, which is why it is widely used in logistic regression and neural networks for gradient descent.\n- **Common Use Cases**: It is often used to model probabilities or to create a binary classification output.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: The sigmoid function is computationally inexpensive and analytically simple.

However, for very large values of \\(n\\), the factorial calculation can become computationally expensive and may lead to integer overflow.\n\n#### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: The function should handle the case when \\(n = 1\\) correctly, returning 2 as there are two paths (right then down, or down then right).\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The factorial calculation can be optimized using combinatorial identities to avoid large intermediate values.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect handling of the factorial calculation can lead to incorrect results or integer overflow.\n- **Optimization Points**: Using the combinatorial identity \\(\\binom{2n}{n} = \\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}\\) can help in reducing the number of multiplications and divisions.\n\n### Question Style\nThe question will require students to implement a function that calculates the number of unique paths in a grid using the binomial coefficient approach. The function should be efficient and handle edge cases correctly.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are given a 2x2 grid, and you are required to calculate the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, where you can only move right or down. The general solution extends to an \\(n \\times n\\) grid.\n\nWrite a Python function `calculate_paths(n: int) -> int` that returns the number of unique paths in an \\(n \\times n\\) grid.\n\n**Function Signature**: `def calculate_paths(n: int) -> int:`\n\n**Input**\n- `n` (1 <= n <= 100): An integer representing the size of the grid.\n\n**Output**\n- An integer representing the number of unique paths in the \\(n \\times n\\) grid.\n\n**Constraints**\n- The input `n` will be a positive integer.\n\n**Example**\n```python\nprint(calculate_paths(2))  # Output: 6\nprint(calculate_paths(20))  # Output: 137846528820\n```\n\n**Note**\n- Use combinatorial mathematics to solve the problem efficiently.\n- Ensure your function handles edge cases correctly.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000055", "row_id": 55, "seed_ids": [474], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Specifically, you need to implement the following features:\n\n1. **Handle Large Inputs**: The function should be able to handle large inputs within the range of a 64-bit integer without causing overflow.\n2. **Handle Floating-Point Precision**: Implement a method to approximate the factorial of floating-point numbers using Stirling's approximation.\n3. **Return Results as a String**: The function should return the result as a string to handle very large numbers that cannot be represented as an integer.\n\nImplement the function `enhanced_factorial` that meets the above requirements.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef enhanced_factorial(number: float) -> str:\n    pass\n```\n\n#### Constraints\n- \\(0 \\leq \\text{number} \\leq 1000\\)\n- The function should handle both integer and floating-point inputs.\n- For floating-point inputs, the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n#### Performance Requirements\n- The function should handle large inputs efficiently and within a reasonable time limit.\n\n#### Examples\n```python\nprint(enhanced_factorial(5))  # \"120\"\nprint(enhanced_factorial(20))  # \"2432902008176640000\"\nprint(enhanced_factorial(0.5))  # \"1.128\"\nprint(enhanced_factorial(3.5))  # \"11.632\"\n```\n\n#### Notes\n- For integer inputs, the function should perform exact computation and return the result as a string.\n- For floating-point inputs, use Stirling's approximation to compute the factorial and round the result to 3 decimal places.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000064", "row_id": 64, "seed_ids": [694], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The goal is to partition a set of data points into a specified number of clusters based on their proximity to the cluster centroids.\n\n#### Scenario\nYou are working on a dataset of customer transaction records and need to segment the customers into a specified number of clusters for targeted marketing campaigns. Your task is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm to achieve this.\n\n#### Input\n- `vectors`: A 2D NumPy array of shape `(n, d)`, where `n` is the number of data points and `d` is the dimensionality of each data point.\n- `noofclusters`: An integer indicating the number of clusters to form.\n\n#### Output\n- `centroids`: A 2D NumPy array of shape `(k, d)`, where `k` is the number of clusters and `d` is the dimensionality of each centroid.\n- `assignments`: A list of integers of length `n`, where each integer represents the cluster assignment of the corresponding data point from `vectors`.\n\n#### Constraints\n- The number of clusters `noofclusters` should be less than the number of data points `n`.\n- The dimensionality `d` of the data points should be greater than 0.\n\n#### Performance Requirements\n- The implementation should be efficient and handle large datasets (e.g., `n` > 10,000 and `d` > 10).\n\n#### Implementation Guidelines\n1. Initialize the centroids randomly from the dataset.\n2. Perform the Expectation step: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Perform the Maximization step: Update the centroids to be the mean of the assigned data points.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 100).\n5. Return the final centroids and assignments.\n\n#### Example\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n\n# Generate sample data\nvectors, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=5, n_features=2, random_state=42)\nnoofclusters = 5\n\n# Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm\ncentroids, assignments = simplified_k_means_clustering(vectors, noofclusters)\n\nprint(\"Centroids:\", centroids)\nprint(\"Assignments:\", assignments)\n```\n\n#### Notes\n- You should not use any external packages other than TensorFlow and NumPy.\n- Ensure that your implementation is self-contained and clear.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000069", "row_id": 69, "seed_ids": [18], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Instead, they primarily operate with basic HTTP requests and file I/O operations using Python's `requests` and `shutil` libraries. However, the code interacts with web APIs and downloads data, which can be analyzed in the context of algorithm analysis.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the `get_apod_data` and `get_archive_data` functions is O(1) as they make a single API call. The `save_apod` function involves downloading an image from the internet, which could have varying time complexities depending on the network speed and image size.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for `get_apod_data` and `get_archive_data`, as they don't use additional space that scales with input size.

They can be integrated into applications that require access to astronomical images or data.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**: The functions are straightforward and easy to use. They handle the complexities of making HTTP requests and saving files.\n- **Limitations**: They do not handle errors or retries for API requests, and the network requests could fail due to various reasons.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: The functions should handle cases where the API is unreachable, the URL is invalid, or the image download fails.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The main bottleneck is the network I/O for downloading the image.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Errors such as network timeouts, HTTP errors, and file I/O errors should be handled properly.\n- **Optimization Points**: Additional features like retries for failed requests, progress tracking during file download, and handling different types of responses could be added.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Scenario\nYou are developing an application that requires access to astronomical images and data from NASA's API. Your application should be able to fetch and save these images locally. To ensure robustness, you need to implement error handling and retry mechanisms.\n\n### Requirement\nWrite a Python function `download_and_save_apod` that fetches the \"Astronomical Picture of the Day\" (APOD) from NASA's APOD API and saves it to a specified directory. The function should handle the following requirements:\n\n1. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully deal with network failures, HTTP errors, and file I/O errors.\n2. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism to attempt downloading the image up to 3 times if the initial attempt fails.\n3. **Input and Output**: The function should take an `api_key` and a `save_path` as arguments and return the APOD data as a dictionary.\n4. **Performance**: Ensure that the function does not hog the system resources and handles large images efficiently.\n5. **Documentation**: Add appropriate comments and docstring to the function for clarity.\n\n### Example\n```python\ndef download_and_save_apod(api_key: str, save_path: str) -> dict:\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\nsave_path = \"./apod_images\"\ndata = download_and_save_apod(api_key, save_path)\nprint(data)\n```\n\n### Constraints\n- The `api_key` is a valid NASA API key.\n- The `save_path` is a valid directory path.\n- The image URLs provided by the APOD API are always valid.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- The function should be able to handle APOD images up to 10MB in size.\n- The function should not block the main thread for long periods during the download process.\n\n### Note\n- Use `requests` and `shutil` to handle HTTP requests and file I/O operations, respectively.\n- Use the `shutil.copyfileobj` method to copy the image data to a file.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000071", "row_id": 71, "seed_ids": [464], "mode": "algorithm"}}

PSNR is a measure of the quality of reconstruction of a signal, commonly used in image and video processing.\n- **Complexity**: The time complexity of the PSNR calculation is primarily defined by the mean squared error (MSE) computation, which is O(n * m), where n and m are the dimensions of the images. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables for the calculation.\n- **Principles**: The PSNR is calculated by first computing the MSE between the original and the contrast images, and then using the formula `PSNR = 20 * log10(PIXEL_MAX) - 10 * log10(MSE)`. The `PIXEL_MAX` value is set to 255 for 8-bit images.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**\n- **Properties**: The PSNR value is high when there is a small MSE, indicating a high-quality reconstruction. It is a commonly used metric for evaluating the quality of image and video compression.\n- **Common Use Cases**: PSNR is often used in multimedia applications, especially in video streaming, to assess the quality of compressed video content.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: PSNR is sensitive to the choice of `PIXEL_MAX` and is not able to account for subjective factors such as human visual perception. It is generally used as a reference metric but may not always reflect human perception accurately.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `mse` is zero by returning 100 dB, as the PSNR in this case is undefined mathematically but practical implementations often return a high value to signify perfect match.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The primary bottleneck is the computation of the MSE, which involves iterating over all pixels of the image. Optimizations could be made by vectorizing operations or using more efficient image processing libraries.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect paths for image files could lead to errors. Additionally, the `PIXEL_MAX` value is hard-coded, which might need to be adjusted for different pixel depths.\n- **Optimization Points**: The function could be optimized by:\n  - Using NumPy operations for element-wise computations.\n  - Preloading the images into NumPy arrays to avoid repeated file reads.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Scenario\nYou are developing a multimedia application where you need to compare the quality of two images to determine the effectiveness of a compression algorithm. Your task is to write a function to calculate the PSNR between two images and a main function to test the implementation.\n\n### Instructions\n1. Implement a function `calculate_psnr(image1: np.ndarray, image2: np.ndarray) -> float` that computes the PSNR between two images.\n2. The function should return the PSNR value in dB.\n3. Ensure the function handles the case where the mean squared error (MSE) is zero.\n4. The images are assumed to be 8-bit grayscale images and are represented as NumPy arrays.\n5. Include a main function `test_psnr()` to test your implementation using the provided images. The main function should:\n   - Compare two images and print the PSNR value.\n   - Compare another pair of images and print the PSNR value, ensuring it matches the expected value of 31.53 dB (from the Wikipedia example).\n\n### Constraints\n- The images are both grayscale and in the range of 0 to 255.\n\n### Example\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nimage1 = np.array([[128, 128, 128], [128, 128, 128]], dtype=np.uint8)\nimage2 = np.array([[128, 128, 128], [128, 128, 128]], dtype=np.uint8)\n\npsnr = calculate_psnr(image1, image2)\nprint(f\"PSNR value is {psnr} dB\")\n# Expected output: PSNR value is 100.0 dB\n```\n\n### Expected Output\n- The PSNR value should be printed in dB.\n- Ensure that the PSNR calculation matches the expected values for the provided images.\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- The function should be efficient and handle large images without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Hint\n- Utilize NumPy for efficient array operations to speed up the computation.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000072", "row_id": 72, "seed_ids": [956], "mode": "algorithm"}}

A reversible number is a positive integer such that the sum of the number and its reverse consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. Leading zeros are not allowed.\n\n### Problem Description\nImplement a function `count_reversible_numbers(max_power: int) -> int` that returns the number of reversible numbers below \\(10^{max_power}\\).\n\n### Constraints\n- \\(1 \\leq max_power \\leq 9\\)\n\n### Input and Output Formats\n- **Input**:\n  - `max_power`: An integer representing the power of 10 to which the upper limit is set.\n- **Output**:\n  - An integer representing the count of reversible numbers below \\(10^{max_power}\\).\n\n### Example\n\n```python\nassert count_reversible_numbers(3) == 120\nassert count_reversible_numbers(6) == 18720\nassert count_reversible_numbers(7) == 68720\n```\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- The solution should be efficient and able to handle the maximum input size within a reasonable time.\n\n### Optimized Solution\nYou are required to optimize the given code to improve its performance.

This is a dynamic programming approach used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array. The core idea is to maintain a running sum of the maximum subarray ending at each position and update the global maximum sum as needed.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

For finding multiple subarrays with the same maximum sum, a more complex approach is needed.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - If all elements in the array are negative, the maximum sum subarray will be the single most positive element.\n  - If the array is empty, a `ValueError` should be raised.\n  - If the input is `None`, a `ValueError` should be raised.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The algorithm performs well for most cases, but the space complexity is O(n) due to recursion if implemented iteratively with a stack.\n- **Error Scenarios**: \n  - If the input is not a sequence, the code may fail.\n  - If the input is a sequence but not an array of integers, the algorithm may raise an error.\n- **Optimization Points**: \n  - To optimize, one can use an iterative approach instead of recursion, reducing the space complexity to O(1).\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are tasked with implementing a function that finds the maximum sum of a subsequence in an array. Unlike finding the maximum sum subarray, the subsequence can be non-contiguous.

A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nYour function should meet the following requirements:\n\n- **Input**: A list of integers.\n- **Output**: An integer representing the maximum sum of a subsequence.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of the input list is between 1 and 1000.\n- Each element in the list is an integer between -1000 and 1000.\n\n**Performance Requirement**:\n- The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\ndef max_subsequence_sum(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n    # Your implementation here\n    pass\n\n# Test cases\nprint(max_subsequence_sum([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]))  # Output: 6\nprint(max_subsequence_sum([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output: -1\nprint(max_subsequence_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 10\nprint(max_subsequence_sum([0]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n**Note**: Ensure your solution handles all edge cases as described in the analysis.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000075", "row_id": 75, "seed_ids": [979], "mode": "algorithm"}}

between different currencies. The core purpose is to facilitate currency conversion and return the result.\n\n**Complexity**: The function makes an HTTP GET request to an external API, which involves network latency. However, the primary complexity is in handling the API response and parsing it. The time complexity is O(1) for the API request itself, but the actual execution time can vary based on network latency. The space complexity is also O(1) as the function only stores a few variables.\n\n**Principles**:\n1. **HTTP Request**: The function constructs a request to the Amdoren Currency API.\n2. **Parameter Handling**: The function handles the input parameters (`from_`, `to`, `amount`, `api_key`) and sends them as query parameters.\n3. **Response Parsing**: The function receives a JSON response, extracts the amount, and returns it as a string.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**:\n- **Properties**: The function supports multiple currencies and provides a simple way to convert amounts.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This function is useful in financial applications, budgeting tools, and any system that requires currency conversion.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: Strengths include automation and ease of use. Limitations include reliance on an external service and the potential for network issues.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: Handling invalid inputs, such as non-existent currencies or non-numeric amounts.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Network latency can affect performance, especially if the API is slow.\n- **Error Scenarios**: The function might return an error message if the API fails or if invalid parameters are provided.\n- **Optimization Points**: Caching results or using a local database for currency conversion can improve performance.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are tasked with enhancing the `convert_currency` function to handle a more complex scenario.

The LCS problem involves identifying the longest sequence of characters that appear in the same relative order in both strings, but not necessarily contiguous.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the provided solution is \\(O(m \\times n)\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are the lengths of the input strings \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively. This is because the solution uses a dynamic programming approach that fills a 2D matrix of size \\(m \\times n\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \\(O(m \\times n)\\) due to the use of the 2D matrix `dp`.\n\n**Principles**:\n- The core of the solution involves a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of the substrings `x[0:i]` and `y[0:j]`.\n- The solution fills the matrix by considering three cases:\n  1. If the characters match (`x[i-1] == y[j-1]`), then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n  2. If the characters do not match, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**:\n- **Properties**: The LCS is a subsequence, meaning the characters can appear in any order but must maintain their relative order in both strings.\n- **Common Use Cases**: LCS is commonly used in various applications such as bioinformatics for DNA sequence alignment, text comparison, and version control systems.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: The dynamic programming approach is efficient for solving the LCS problem. However, it has a high space complexity due to the storage of the entire matrix. For extremely large strings, this can be impractical.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: The code handles the case where one or both strings are empty, returning a length of 0 and an empty subsequence.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The primary bottleneck is the \\(O(m \\times n)\\) time and space complexity, which can be prohibitive for very large strings.\n- **Error Scenarios**: The code ensures that the input strings are not `None` and handles the case of identical strings correctly.\n- **Optimization Points**: One optimization could be to use space optimization by storing only two rows of the DP table at a time, reducing the space complexity to \\(O(n)\\).\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\nYou are tasked with enhancing the existing LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) solution to include additional functionalities. Your task is to modify the provided code to achieve the following:\n\n1. **Return All LCS**: Instead of just the length of the LCS, modify the solution to also return all possible LCS sequences as a list of strings. If there are multiple LCS sequences of the same length, include all of them in the list.\n\n2. **Print All LCS**: Additionally, print all the LCS sequences in a formatted manner, similar to the provided example.\n\n3. **Optimize Space Usage**: Optimize the space complexity of the solution to \\(O(n)\\) by using only two rows of the DP table at a time.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The length of both input strings will be between 1 and 1000.\n\n**Input**:\n- Two strings `x` and `y` as input.\n\n**Output**:\n- A tuple containing:\n  - The length of the LCS.\n  - A list of all LCS sequences.\n\n**Performance Requirement**:\n- The solution should be efficient and handle large input strings within a reasonable time.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\na = \"AGGTAB\"\nb = \"GXTXAYB\"\nexpected_output = (4, [\"GTAB\", \"GBAB\"])\nprint(longest_common_subsequence(a, b))\n# Output:\n# len = 4, sub-sequence = GTAB\n# len = 4, sub-sequence = GBAB\n# (4, ['GTAB', 'GBAB'])\n```\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000082", "row_id": 82, "seed_ids": [28], "mode": "algorithm"}}

For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than\nnine and relatively prime to nine, \u03c6(9)=6.\n\nThe number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so\n\u03c6(1)=1.\n\nInterestingly, \u03c6(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation\nof 79180.\n\nFind the value of n, 1 < n < 10^7, for which \u03c6(n) is a permutation of n and\nthe ratio n/\u03c6(n) produces a minimum.\n\n-----\n\nThis is essentially brute force. Calculate all totients up to 10^7 and\nfind the minimum ratio of n/\u03c6(n) that way. To minimize the ratio, we want\nto minimize n and maximize \u03c6(n) as much as possible, so we can store the\nminimum fraction's numerator and denominator and calculate new fractions\nwith each totient to compare against.

A recurring cycle is identified when a remainder repeats, indicating the start of the cycle.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n**Properties**:\n- The algorithm uses modular arithmetic to find the remainders, which helps in identifying the repeating cycle.\n- The algorithm relies on the property that the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{1}{d} \\) is periodic if and only if \\( d \\) is not a power of \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\).\n\n**Common Use Cases**:\n- This algorithm is used to find the longest recurring cycle in the decimal representation of unit fractions, which is a common problem in number theory and programming challenges.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**: The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement. It provides a clear understanding of the repeating decimal cycles.\n- **Limitations**: The brute-force approach is inefficient for large ranges and can be optimized using more advanced number theory techniques such as the Euler's totient function.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n**Edge Cases**:\n- The algorithm assumes that the denominator is not a power of \\( 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\), which are the only denominators that do not have a repeating decimal representation.\n\n**Performance Bottlenecks**:\n- The algorithm's time complexity is high, making it inefficient for large ranges. Each iteration involves up to \\( 1000 \\) divisions, leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\n**Error Scenarios**:\n- Incorrect handling of remainders can lead to incorrect cycle detection. For instance, if the algorithm does not correctly identify the start of the cycle, the result may be incorrect.\n\n**Optimization Points**:\n- The algorithm can be optimized using properties from number theory, such as Euler's totient function, to reduce the number of divisions needed.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Problem Description\nIn the context of number theory and decimal expansions, we are interested in finding the denominator \\( d \\) (where \\( d < 1000 \\)) that produces the longest recurring cycle in the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{1}{d} \\). \n\nGiven the brute-force approach implemented in the provided code, you are tasked with writing a function to find the value of \\( d \\) that yields the longest recurring cycle. \n\n### Function Signature\n```python\ndef find_longest_recurring_cycle(denominator_limit: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the value of d < denominator_limit for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.\n\n    :param denominator_limit: The upper limit for the search (exclusive).\n    :return: The value of d that produces the longest recurring cycle.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Constraints\n- \\( 2 \\leq denominator_limit \\leq 1000 \\)\n\n### Examples\n```python\n# Example 1\nprint(find_longest_recurring_cycle(10))  # Output: 7\n\n# Example 2\nprint(find_longest_recurring_cycle(100))  # Output: 97\n\n# Example 3\nprint(find_longest_recurring_cycle(1000))  # Output: 983\n```\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- The function should be efficient and handle the given constraints within the required time and space limits.\n\n### Implementation\nImplement the function to find the value of \\( d \\) that produces the longest recurring cycle in the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{1}{d} \\).\n\n### Hints\n- Consider using a more efficient algorithm or number theory techniques to improve performance.\n- Ensure correct handling of remainders and edge cases.\n- Optimize the code to handle the given constraints efficiently.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000092", "row_id": 92, "seed_ids": [487], "mode": "algorithm"}}

The time complexity depends on the function evaluations at each step, which can vary based on the step size and the nature of the ODE.\n- **Principles**: The RK45 method is an adaptive Runge-Kutta method involving a combination of the 4th and 5th order Runge-Kutta methods. It uses a 5th-order method for the main integration and a 4th-order method for error estimation to adjust the step size.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n- **Properties**: The method is designed to provide a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. It automatically adjusts the step size to maintain a specified error tolerance.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This method is widely used in scientific computation and engineering for solving ODEs where high accuracy is required.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**: The strengths include its adaptive step-size control, which makes it efficient and suitable for a wide range of problems. Limitations include the complexity of the implementation and the need for a function to be differentiable.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n- **Edge Cases**: Ensure correct handling of initial and final conditions, especially when the step size or initial/final values are not correctly specified.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The main bottleneck is the number of function evaluations, which increases with smaller step sizes. Careful management of the step size and error estimation is crucial.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect implementation of the step-size adjustment or error estimation can lead to inaccurate solutions or unstable behavior.\n- **Optimization Points**: Optimizing the function evaluations and step-size adjustment can improve performance.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n### Scenario\nYou are tasked with implementing a robust version of the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RK45) method for solving ordinary differential equations. This version should include additional checks and optimizations to ensure the method works correctly and efficiently.\n\n### Task\nImplement the `runge_kutta_fehlberg_45` function that solves an ODE given by the function `func` using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. The function should:\n- Validate the inputs: `func`, `x_initial`, `y_initial`, `step_size`, and `x_final`.\n- Use the RK45 method to solve the ODE and return the solution `y` at each nodal point.\n- Ensure the step size is positive and the final value of `x` is greater than the initial value.\n\n### Requirements\n1. **Inputs**:\n   - `func`: A function representing the ODE, which takes two arguments `x` and `y`, and returns the derivative `dy/dx`.\n   - `x_initial`: The initial value of `x`.\n   - `y_initial`: The initial value of `y`.\n   - `step_size`: The increment value of `x`.\n   - `x_final`: The final value of `x`.\n\n2. **Output**:\n   - A NumPy array containing the solution `y` at each nodal point.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The `step_size` must be a positive number.\n   - The final value of `x` must be greater than the initial value of `x`.\n\n4. **Performance**:\n   - The function should efficiently handle the solution process and avoid unnecessary computations.\n\n### Example\n```python\ndef f(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\ny = runge_kutta_fehlberg_45(f, 0, 0, 0.1, 1)\nprint(y)\n```\n\n### Expected Output\n```\narray([ 0.00000000e+00,  1.00000000e-01,  2.05000000e-01,  3.15500000e-01,\n        4.32250000e-01,  5.56785000e-01,  6.89364500e-01,  8.29995350e-01,\n        9.78794935e-01,  1.13687443e+00,  1.30446187e+00,  1.48173531e+00,\n        1.66979727e+00,  1.86904726e+00,  2.07978369e+00,  2.29220419e+00,\n        2.51641445e+00,  2.75261038e+00,  2.99999999e+00,  3.25867937e+00,\n        3.52873731e+00,  3.80917374e+00,  4.09999999e+00,  4.39221387e+00,\n        4.68571341e+00,  4.98049310e+00,  5.27655090e+00,  5.57388469e+00,\n        5.87250319e+00,  6.17230427e+00,  6.47328584e+00,  6.77544669e+00,\n        7.07878461e+00,  7.38330738e+00,  7.68891368e+00,  8.00000000e+00])\n```\n\n### Notes\n- Ensure all edge cases are handled appropriately.\n- Use efficient computation and minimize unnecessary operations.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000094", "row_id": 94, "seed_ids": [827], "mode": "algorithm"}}

It uses a stack data structure to ensure that the sequence of brackets is properly nested. The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string and uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if it matches the most recent opening bracket by popping from the stack. If the stack is empty or the brackets do not match, the sequence is not properly nested.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the input string.

Nodes are sorted in increasing order of frequency.\n2. **Dictionary**: A dictionary (`self.cache`) is used to map keys to their corresponding nodes in the linked list. This allows for O(1) access to any node in the list.\n3. **Frequency Update**: When a key is accessed or updated, the frequency of its node is incremented. The node is then repositioned in the linked list to maintain the correct order based on its updated frequency.\n\n### Characteristics & Applications\n\n**Properties**:\n- **Frequency-based Ordering**: Nodes are ordered in the linked list based on their access frequency.\n- **Eviction Policy**: The least frequently used items are evicted when the cache exceeds its capacity.\n\n**Common Use Cases**:\n- **Web Caching**: Caching frequently accessed web resources to reduce server load and improve response times.\n- **Database Caching**: Storing frequently accessed database records to reduce database query times.\n\n**Strengths/Limitations**:\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Efficient eviction of least frequently used items.\n  - Fast access to cached items.\n\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Slightly more complex to implement compared to other cache mechanisms.\n  - Requires careful management of node repositioning in the linked list.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- **Empty Cache**: Handling cases where the cache is initially empty.\n- **Full Cache**: Handling evictions when the cache is full.\n\n**Performance Bottlenecks**:\n- **Node Repositioning**: The `_position_node` method involves swapping nodes, which can be costly.\n- **Linked List Operations**: Operations like `add`, `remove`, and repositioning can be O(n) in the worst case.\n\n**Error Scenarios**:\n- **Incorrect Node Reinsertion**: Forgetting to update the node's previous and next pointers during repositioning can lead to list corruption.\n- **Eviction Failure**: Failing to handle cases where eviction is necessary but not possible due to internal errors.\n\n**Optimization Points**:\n- **Efficient Node Repositioning**: Using a more efficient algorithm for repositioning nodes (e.g., using a priority queue).\n- **Thread Safety**: Ensuring cache operations are thread-safe if used in a concurrent environment.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n**Problem Statement**:\nYou are tasked with implementing an LFU Cache that supports the following operations:\n- `put(key, value)`: Insert a key-value pair into the cache. If the cache is at capacity, it should evict the least frequently used item first.\n- `get(key)`: Retrieve the value associated with the given key. If the key is not found, return `None`.\n\n**Cache Operations**:\n- The cache should maintain a doubly linked list to order nodes based on their frequency.\n- Nodes should be repositioned in the list to maintain the correct order.\n- The cache should use a dictionary to map keys to their corresponding nodes.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- The capacity of the LFU Cache will be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).\n- The key and value types can be any valid Python objects.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\ncache = LFUCache(2)\ncache.put(1, 1)\ncache.put(2, 2)\nprint(cache.get(1))  # Output: 1\ncache.put(3, 3)\nprint(cache.get(2))  # Output: None\ncache.put(4, 4)\nprint(cache.get(1))  # Output: None\nprint(cache.get(3))  # Output: 3\nprint(cache.get(4))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```python\nclass LFUCache(Generic[T, U]):\n    def __init__(self, capacity: int):\n        pass\n\n    def get(self, key: T) -> U | None:\n        pass\n\n    def put(self, key: T, value: U) -> None:\n        pass\n```\n\n**Note**:\n- Ensure the cache operations are efficient and handle edge cases correctly.\n- The provided code snippet includes a `DoubleLinkedList` class and a `LFUCache` class with some methods implemented. You need to implement the `get` and `put` methods.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000096", "row_id": 96, "seed_ids": [975], "mode": "algorithm"}}

Sepia is a color transformation that gives a photograph a warm, aged look. This effect is achieved by modifying the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values of each pixel in an image.\n\n**Complexity**:\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n \\times m)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of rows and \\(m\\) is the number of columns in the image. This is because the algorithm iterates over every pixel in the image.\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) since the algorithm modifies the image in place and does not require any additional space that scales with the input size.\n\n**Principles**:\n1. Convert the image to grayscale using a weighted sum of the RGB values.\n2. Modify the grayscale values to achieve the sepia effect by adjusting the red, green, and blue components based on a given factor.\n\n**Characteristics & Applications**:\n- **Properties**: The sepia effect is effective for creating a warm, nostalgic look in photographs and is often used in artistic or vintage-style images.\n- **Common Use Cases**: This technique is commonly used in digital photography and graphic design to give images a more artistic or vintage look.\n- **Strengths/Limitations**:\n  - **Strengths**: The sepia tone effect can enhance the visual appeal of images, particularly those that are old or have a historical context.\n  - **Limitations**: The sepia effect is a simple color transformation and does not enhance image clarity or contrast. It is limited in its ability to improve image quality for practical applications.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**:\n- **Edge Cases**: The algorithm should handle images of different sizes and color depths. It should also gracefully handle edge cases where the modified values exceed the valid range (0-255) for an 8-bit image.\n- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The nested loops over the image pixels can be computationally expensive for large images. Optimizing the loop structure or using vectorized operations can help improve performance.\n- **Error Scenarios**: Incorrect factor values can lead to unexpected color shifts. The algorithm should ensure that the new RGB values remain within the valid range.\n- **Optimization Points**: Using OpenCV's vectorized operations or parallel processing techniques can enhance performance without significantly altering the algorithm's logic.\n\n<|Analysis End|>\n\n<|Question Begin|>\n\n## Scenario\nYou are tasked with enhancing the functionality of an image processing application. Your goal is to implement a more advanced color transformation technique that not only applies a sepia tone but also adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image. This will improve the visual appeal and artistic quality of the images processed by the application.\n\n## Requirements\n1. **Input**: The function should accept an image (as a NumPy array) and two parameters: `factor` (an integer representing the sepia effect intensity, where a higher value enhances the sepia tone) and `brightness` (an integer representing the brightness adjustment, where positive values increase brightness and negative values decrease it).\n2. **Output**: Return the modified image as a NumPy array.\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - The input image is represented as a NumPy array of shape \\( (H, W, 3) \\) where \\( H \\) is the height and \\( W \\) is the width of the image.\n   - The `factor` and `brightness` parameters are integers, and valid values for `factor` are in the range \\([0, 100]\\), and for `brightness` are in the range \\([-100, 100]\\).\n4. **Performance**: The solution should be efficient, especially for large images, and should avoid unnecessary memory usage.\n\n## Function Signature\n```python\ndef enhanced_sepia(image: np.ndarray, factor: int, brightness: int) -> np.ndarray:\n    pass\n```\n\n## Example\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nimage = np.array([[[255, 255, 255], [0, 0, 0]], [[128, 128, 128], [64, 64, 64]]], dtype=np.uint8)\nresult = enhanced_sepia(image, 50, 10)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Expected Output\n```\narray([[[191, 170, 145], [ 23,  12,   0]], [[ 91,  76,  61], [ 44,  41,  34]]], dtype=uint8)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The sepia effect is applied with a `factor` of 50, enhancing the sepia tone.\n- The image brightness is increased by 10.\n\n## Evaluation\nYour implementation will be evaluated based on the correctness of the output, efficiency, and adherence to the constraints. Additionally, ensure that the code handles edge cases and performance bottlenecks effectively.\n\n<|Question End|>"}], "metadata": {"prompt_id": "00000097", "row_id": 97, "seed_ids": [837], "mode": "algorithm"}}
