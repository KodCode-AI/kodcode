  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the first unique element in an array. The function is called find_first_unique, and it takes a list of integers and returns an integer. If every element is repeated, it returns -1.\n\nLet me think about what a unique element means. Oh right, it's an element that appears exactly once in the array. And I have to find the first occurrence of such an element.\n\nSo how can I approach this? Well, one way is to count the frequency of each element. Once I have the counts, I can iterate through the array again and return the first index where the count is 1.\n\nFirst step: count the occurrences. So I can use a dictionary for this. Initialize an empty dict, then loop through each element in the array. For each element, increment its count in the dictionary.\n\nOnce the counts are ready, I loop through the array again from the beginning. For each element, check if its count is 1. The first one that satisfies this is the answer. If none are found after checking all, return -1.\n\nLet's see how this applies to the test cases.\n\nTest case 1: [2,3,4,3,2]. The counts are 2:2, 3:2, 4:1. So the first unique is 4 at index 2, right? No wait, wait, no: when the array is [2,3,4,3,2], the elements are 2,3,4,3,2. So 4 is at index 2. But wait, the first element is 2, which has a count of 2, so it's not unique. Then 3 has count 2; not unique. Then 4 has count 1, so it is unique. So the function returns 2. Wait no, looking at the first test case in the examples, the output is 0. Wait a minute, that can't be right. Oh wait in the sample input [2,3,4,3,2], the function returns 0? Or maybe I'm reading it wrong.\n\nWait no, looking at the user's examples: the first example given is find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) returns 0, but according to my calculation, the first unique is 4 at index 2.\n\nWait that's a problem. Wait, no\u2014that suggests my approach is wrong because my method wouldn't return 0.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Wait, what's the first index with a non-repeated element? So in [2,3,4,3,2], the elements are 2 (from index 0), 3 (index 1),4 (index2), 3 again, and 2 again. So for the counts: 2 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 4 appears once. So the first element that is unique is 4, which is at index 2. But the sample test case says that the function returns 0, not 2. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait that can't be right. Or maybe I interpreted the sample wrong. Looking again: find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]). The output is 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the test case. Let's list the array:\nindexes and elements:\n\n0:2\n\n1:3\n\n2:4\n\n3:3\n\n4:2\n\nSo, when we look for the first element that is unique. 2 appears at 0 and 4\u2014that's twice, so not unique.\n\n3 appears at 1 and 3\u2014twice.\n\n4 appears once, so the unique element is 4, at index 2. So the sample expecting 0 is confusing. So why does the sample return 0?\n\nWait no, I must have read the sample wrong. Let me read the user-provided samples again.\n\nHere are the samples:\n\n>>> find_first_unique([2, 3, 4, 3, 2]) returns 0.\n\nWait, that would imply that element at index 0 is 2, which is not unique, since it appears again later. So why is that the result? Unless I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait wait, perhaps the definition is that the first unique element in the array\u2014does unique mean that no other element is the same? Like the first element that doesn't repeat. So in [2,3,4,3,2], 2 occurs again at index4. So, for each element, we need to determine whether it's unique.\n\nSo for 2 at 0: is there any other 2? Yes, index4.\n\nSo it's not unique.\n\n3 at 1: is there another 3? Yes, index3.\n\n4 at 2: no others. So it is unique.\n\nSo function should return 2. But the sample says 0. Hmm. So this must mean I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, or perhaps in the array, the unique elements are the first occurrence of an element that is unique. So wait, maybe the function is intended to find the first element that is unique in the entire array, not considering its occurrence before. Or perhaps, perhaps the sample is wrong? But that's unlikely.\n\nWait perhaps the sample is the opposite, perhaps the function returns the first element that occurs only once. So in the first sample, 2 appears twice, 3 appears twice, 4 appears once\u2014so function should return 4's index which is 2, sample expects 0.\n\nBut the given sample shows 0. There's a contradiction here.\n\nWait perhaps I misread the sample. Let me check again.\n\nThe sample given is:\n\n>>> find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps the definition is different. Maybe an element is unique if it's the last in the array, but that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the first element such that all elements after its first occurrence don't repeat, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait now I'm really confused. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nWait perhaps I should look at other samples.\n\nAnother sample: [7,8,8,9,7]. The output is 3.\n\nLooking at this array: 7 appears at 0 and 4, 8 appears at 1 and2, 9 at3. So the count is 7:2,8:2,9:1. So the unique is 9 at index3. So sample output 3 is correct.\n\nSo in the first sample, the unique is 4 at index2.\n\nSo why does the sample expect the function to return 0.\n\nWait perhaps I'm completely misunderstanding what a unique element is.\n\nWait maybe, perhaps the unique element is the first element that appears once, but only when looking after it. Like, in the array, if there's no element after it that is same as it.\n\nBut that would be a different problem.\n\nWait perhaps the function is supposed to find the first element that doesn't appear anywhere else in the array before or after.\n\nWait but in that case, for [2,3,4,3,2], 4 at index2 doesn't appear again, but 2 appears again at the end. So 4 is unique because it doesn't repeat again. Hmm\u2014that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is to find the first element that does not have any duplicates in the array. So 4 is the unique element.\n\nBut that would make the first sample's expected output 2, not 0. But the sample expects 0 for [2,3,4,3,2]. So why?\n\nUnless, perhaps, the sample is wrong, or I have a fundamental misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not to find the first occurrence of a unique element, but the first element that is unique when considering the array from the beginning, checking previous elements. So for each element, check if in the elements before it, is there any duplicate? Or is it that the first occurrence of a unique element, but the uniqueness is in the entire array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the first occurrence of the element that appears exactly once in the array.\n\nSo, the definition is to return the first index where the element occurs exactly once.\n\nSo to calculate, for each element, check the count. If any element in the array has a count of 1, return the first occurrence of such element.\n\nSo, the approach:\n\n1. Create a frequency map (counts each element's occurrences).\n\n2. Iterate through the array, for each element, check if count is 1.\n\n3. The first such element's index is the answer.\n\n4. If no element has count 1, return -1.\n\nSo in [2,3,4,3,2], counts are {2:2,3:2,4:1}.\n\nThe elements are 2,3,4,3,2.\n\nSo during iteration:\n\nIndex0: 2 has count 2, skip.\n\nIndex1:3 has count2, skip.\n\nIndex2:4 has count1, return 2.\n\nBut the sample expects 0. So that must not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the sample.\n\nLooking again:\n\nSample1: [2,3,4,3,2] \u2192 expected 0. But according to my approach, the correct answer is 2.\n\nThis suggests that either the approach is incorrect, or the sample is misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find the first occurrence in the array, that is also unique, but in a different way. Maybe the first element that is unique in the entire array is at index0, but 2 appears again\u2014so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition is that other elements are unique after it. No, that's not making much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's definition is a bit different. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe function returns the first index of the element that is not repeated in the array. If no such element exists, returns -1.\n\nHmm. So the wording is \"not repeated in the array\". So an element that is not present more than once.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo given that the sample says find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 0, which suggests that the function is returning 0. But according to the counts, index0 is for 2 which appears twice. So why is that the case?\n\nWait is the function supposed to find the first occurrence that is unique in the first iteration? Or perhaps it's looking for the first occurrence that has no next occurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps, perhaps for the first element, even if it's duplicated later, the function doesn't count it. Hmm, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array is [2, 3, 4, 3, 2], but in this array, the 4 is unique. Wait, no\u2014the problem is that for [2,3,4,3,2], the count of 2 is 2 and 4 is 1.\n\nHmm. So according to the sample, the function returns 0. So why?\n\nWait maybe I've got the definition wrong.\n\nWait in the sample, find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 0: that would mean that 2 is the first unique element, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the first position where the element before it is different and the element after is different. But that's not the same as not being repeated anywhere in the array.\n\nNo, that's a different problem.\n\nWait this is getting me stuck. Maybe I should write out the test cases.\n\nSample 1: input [2,3,4,3,2], output 0.\n\nIs that the correct output?\n\nWait let's count the uniqueness:\n\nEach element's count:\n\n2:2,3:2,4:1.\n\nThus, 4 is unique. So why is 0 the answer.\n\nUnless the function is supposed to find the first element that does not have any next occurrence.\n\nWait, for the first element 2, it appears again at index4. So it's not unique in the array.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, it's not unique. So why is the function returning 0.\n\nHmm\u2014it must be that the sample is not expecting 0 in this case. Unless I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait maybe I've misread the sample. Maybe the sample is for another similar problem. For example, the function could be expecting the first element that becomes unique after considering it. Or, perhaps, the sample is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not interpreting the problem statement correctly.\n\nWait re-reading the problem statement:\n\n\" Returns the first index of the element that is not repeated in the array.\"\n\nSo an element is considered not repeated if it appears exactly once. So in the array, the unique elements have count 1.\n\nOnce.\n\nSo that's my approach\u2014it counts the elements and finds the first index with count 1.\n\nSo in the first sample, the first such index is 2, but the expected output is 0.\n\nThis implies that either my approach is wrong or the sample is incorrect.\n\nNow I'm really confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to return the first element which is followed by a different element.\n\nBut that's not quite right. Because 4 is followed by 3 and 2.\n\nWait no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to find the first element that is unique, but considering whether previous elements are repeating it.\n\nFor example, the first element is 2. The function would not count it because it appears later. So the second element 3, previous elements don't have it\u2014 but in this sample, the problem is that function returns 0.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is reversed: for each element, we only look ahead and see if there's a duplicate. So the first occurrence of an element that is only once in the remaining part of the array.\n\nSo like, for the first element, you check the elements after it (3,4,3,2) and see if 2 is there again\u2014yes, it's there at the end. So the first element is not unique.\n\nThen the second element is 3. Check the remaining elements (4,3,2). There's a 3 in position3. So not unique.\n\nThird element is4. Remaining elements (3,2)). No 4. So returns index2.\n\nWhich would match the expected sample output, but that's not what the user has.\n\nWait but in the given sample, the first test case is [2,3,4,3,2], which expects output0. So that suggests that according to the problem, the output is 0.\n\nThat's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have the problem statement wrong, perhaps the function is to find the last unique element.\n\nNo, the sample for [7,8,8,9,7] returns3: which is the position of 9 as the unique element.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the first element that is not present in the rest of the array.\n\nIn which case, for [2,3,4,3,2], the first element 2: the rest of array has 3,4,3,2. Does it contain another 2? Yes. So no.\n\n3: the rest has 4,3,2\u2014no, because 3 is present again. So and so on, until 4: the rest is 3,2, which does not contain a 4. So returns index2.\n\nWhich aligns with the correct approach.\n\nBut again, the sample expects 0.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck in a loop. Maybe I should just proceed with my approach, implement it, and see if it passes other test cases. Perhaps the sample is wrong.\n\nWait looking at other samples:\n\nSample 2: [1,2,3,4]. All are unique. So the function returns0, which is correct.\n\nSample3: [1,1,2,2]. None unique, returns-1.\n\nSample5: [5] \u2192 returns0.\n\nSample6: [7,8,8,9,7]\u2192returns3 (index of9, who appears once. Correct.\n\nSo when using my approach, the first test case would have function returning2, but according to the user-provided sample, it's expecting0.\n\nWhich is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misreading the user's sample.\n\nWait perhaps I've misread. Let me recheck.\n\nWait perhaps the first sample is different.\n\nUser-provided sample for find_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 0.\n\nWait wait wait\u2014is it possible that the function considers the first position where the element is unique when considering the subarray starting from that position onwards? For example:\n\nLooking at each position, and checking for the first position where the element doesn't appear again in the array beyond that.\n\nSo for position0 in [2,3,4,3,2], 2 appears also at position4 (later). So 2 is not unique in the entire array.\n\nBut for position1, 3 appears later.\n\nPosition2: 4 appears once. So in the entire array, it's unique, so returns2.\n\nWhich would mean the sample is wrong if they claim that it returns0. Otherwise, perhaps the definition is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find the first element which has no duplicates before it.\n\nSo considering unique elements in the sense that before it, the same element hasn't occurred.\n\nIn [2,3,4,3,2], index0:2 occurs before nowhere, but that doesn't mean it's unique in the array, because it occurs later. So I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function returns the first occurrence that is unique in the entire array.\n\nYes, that's the same as the approach I thought of.\n\nSo perhaps I should proceed with the approach.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nIn Python, for the function:\n\ndef find_first_unique(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each element in arr.\n\n2. Iterate over the array, for each element, return the index if count is 1.\n\n3. Else, return -1.\n\nSo in Python, to count the frequencies, I can use a dictionary, or use collections.Counter.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nCode sketch:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_first_unique(arr):\n    counts = Counter(arr)\n    for index, num in enumerate(arr):\n        if counts[num] == 1:\n            return index\n    return -1\n\nTesting this function with the sample.\n\nSample1: [2,3,4,3,2]. Expected output0, but function returns2.\n\nWhich conflict.\n\nSo perhaps there's a wrong understanding of the problem.\n\nMaybe alternative approach: the unique element is one that occurs only once in the first half, or another logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the first element that is not equal to the next element. But that would return 0 (2 !=3) for sample1.\n\nBut in that case, for [1,2,3,4] the function would return0 (1 !=2), which matches sample expected0. For [1,1,2,2], each element is same as next except index2, which is2 !=3? Wait no. For [1,1,2,2], index0 is1, next is1: so no, but index1 is1, next 2: so no, function returns index1 as 1 !=2. But that wouldn't solve the problem as specified, since in that sample, the function is supposed to return-1.\n\nThus, the initial approach seems correct, but the problem is that the sample contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is written from right to left.\n\nWait checking sample1: [2,3,4,3,2]. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the last unique element?\n\nNo, because sample6 returns3.\n\nIn sample6: [7,8,8,9,7], the last unique would be9 at index3.\n\nYes, which matches the sample.\n\nSample4: empty array return-1.\n\nSample5: [5] returns0.\n\nHmm\u2014what function returns last unique? It wouldn't for [1,2,3,4], as function returns0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the sample expects0, but the last unique would be4.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nThus, perhaps it's best to proceed with the initial approach.\n\nBut in that case, sample1 is expecting0, but according to the approach, it would return2.\n\nSo, perhaps the sample is incorrect.\n\nWait perhaps, a misunderstanding.\n\nWait wait. Wait the array is [2,3,4,3,2]. The first element is 2, which appears again. So according to the initial approach, no.\n\nWait perhaps the function is supposed to find the first occurrence of a unique element, but that can appear later again.\n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to find a duplicate somewhere in the array, with the first occurrence of an element that isn't followed by duplicates.\n\nNo, that idea is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to find the first element which is smaller than all elements after it. But this is not relevant.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the sample.\n\nWait perhaps the sample is written in reverse. Or perhaps I'm reading it backwards.\n\nWait for [2,3,4,3,2], the output is0, so perhaps the function is considering that the element does not reappear before it. Which is always true for the first occurrence.\n\nBut that's not the definition of uniqueness.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find the first occurrence of an element that hasn't been seen before, regardless of later occurrences.\n\nFor example: in the array [2,3,4,3,2], the elements are 2 then3 then4. 2 hasn't been seen before when first encountered, but since it appears again later, it's not unique. 3 hasn't been encountered before, processed as maybe unique, but also appers again. 4 appears for the first time and is not seen again. So function returns index2.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nOnce again, that's not matching the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCount the occurrences, but then find the first element that has an earlier index than any of its duplicates. Wait, but that's the same as the first occurrence.\n\nSo I'm not seeing how this can yield different results.\n\nWait unless, perhaps, the first occurrence is somehow considered as unique.\n\nBut the first occurrence could have duplicates later. So not unique.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the first index where the element before it is different, and the same as the elements after.\n\nBut I'm not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to return the first index of the element that appears exactly once, but in the array, but my approach's result doesn't match the sample.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the sample shows the wrong output, or perhaps I'm misreading the sample.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps I can proceed with writing the code as per the initial approach and see.\n\nThus, the code is as I thought: count frequencies, iterate and return the first index with count1.\n\nSo to implement this.\n\nTesting this function with sample1:\n\nfind_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 function returns2.\n\nBut sample expects0.\n\nHence, perhaps the problem has a different definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample is intended to have the first element which occurs once, but in small test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps write code and see.\n\nLet me test the function.\n\nCase1:\n\ntest_input = [2,3,4,3,2]\n\nThe counts are:\n\n2:2,3:2,4:1.\n\nSo, for each element in the array:\n\nCheck 2 at 0: 2 not unique.\n\n3 at1: not.\n\n4 at2: unique, so return2.\n\nWhich would not align with sample excepting0.\n\nThus, perhaps the function is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for elements that are not followed by duplicates.\n\nMeaning, the first time for which the element in question doesn't appear again.\n\nThus, perhaps for the first element 2, since there is another 2 later, it is not; but perhaps the last 2 is unique in that position.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, for the first element, is it a duplicate of any element that comes after it. If it is, it's not the first unique.\n\nWait that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, the function is supposed to find the first occurrence which is unique from the first occurrence onwards, but not the entire array.\n\nBut that's getting ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition is of a unique element as one that's the first to occur and doesn't occur again in the remaining array.\n\nBut then, for [2,3,4,3,2], the element at index0, 2, the remaining array has a 2, so returns no.\n\nSo the function should return the first element where, in the entire array, it's unique.\n\nThus, not sure.\n\nBut given the samples, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait let me try to code the function as per the initial approach.\n\nSo define counts as Counter(arr). Then loop through each element, index in arr, and return the first index with count1.\n\nThus, the code as earlier.\n\nThen see if it fits the other samples.\n\nTesting sample [7,8,8,9,7].\n\nCounts:7:2,8:2,9:1.\n\nSo 9 is unique. So function returns3, which is correct.\n\nTesting sample [1,2,3,4], all counts are1. So function returns0, correct.\n\nTesting sample [1,1,2,2], all counts>1. So function returns-1.\n\nTesting sample [5], returns0.\n\nTesting sample [2,3,4,3,2], returns2. But the provided sample says it returns0.\n\nThus, according to the function, the sample's test case expects0 but function returns2.\n\nWhich suggests that either the sample is wrong or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial sample in the problem is written for a different function.\n\nHmm.\n\nIndeed, perhaps the problem is expecting to find the first element that does not have any adjacent duplicates. But in [2,3,4,3,2], 2 is followed by3 (no duplicate),3 followed by4 (no duplicate),4 is followed by3 (no duplicate). So 2 at index0 would be the output.\n\nBut that would not match the problem statement.\n\nWait, what's the first element that doesn't have duplicates in the previous or next positions? Then it's different.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find elements with no duplicates after that point.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should process to provide the code according to the initial approach.\n\nProbably, in the problem statement, the first sample is incorrect. But perhaps that's not the case. Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the first element that occurs exactly once in the suffix starting at that element.\n\nMeaning for index i, arr[i] doesn't appear again in arr[i+1:].\n\nSo, for each element, check the subarray after it.\n\nIn [2,3,4,3,2]: when i=0, arr[i]=2. Does 2 appear anywhere after i=0?\n\nYes, at index4. So not unique in the suffix.\n\ni=1:3 appears again at index3. So not unique.\n\ni=2:4 is the next elements; after i=2, we have 3,2\u2014no 4. So 4 is unique in the suffix. So returns i=2.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample.\n\nIndeed, the sample expects0. So no, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is seeking the first element that occurs only once up to that point, regardless of what's after.\n\nBut that would give different results.\n\nLike [2,3,4,3,2]:\n\ni=0: 2 is unique in the first occurrence. But since it appears again, no.\n\ni=1:3 is second element, but perhaps up to index1, 2 and3 are unique. So that's not the point.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first occurrence where all prior elements are duplicates, except itself.\n\nBut that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck. So I think I should proceed with the initial approach as per the problem statement, write the code, and then see.\n\nThus, in the code, the frequencies are counted correctly, and the first element with a count of 1 is returned.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_first_unique(arr):\n    counts = Counter(arr)\n    for index, num in enumerate(arr):\n        if counts[num] == 1:\n            return index\n    return -1\n\nAnd that's the function.\n\nNow, considering that for the first sample:\n\nfind_first_unique([2,3,4,3,2]) \u2192 returns2, but user expects0.\n\nSo either:\n\n1. The problem is as per the function.\n\n2. Or the user-provided sample is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I should read the problem once again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"Returns the first index of the element that is not repeated in the array. If no such element exists, returns -1.\"\n\nHmm. So the function needs to find the first occurrence where the element is unique in the entire array.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct.\n\nThus, the sample1 given with output0 must be possibly incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps it's best to provide the code as per the approach.\n\nNow, let's write the step-by-step explanation.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.\n\n2. Iterate through the array, checking each element's count.\n\n3. The first element with a count of 1 is the first unique element, return its index.\n\n4. If no elements have a count of 1, return -1.\n\nThus, the function is as we have thought.\n\nTesting it shows that it would pass the samples except maybe the first one provided in the user's example, which is possibly a typo.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nBut given the samples, when I run the function, sample1 returns2.\n\nThus, the function is written as such.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first unique element in an array. A unique element is defined as an element that appears exactly once in the array. If no such element exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we count the frequency of each element in the array using a dictionary. This helps us quickly determine how many times each element appears.\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Next, we iterate through the array while checking the frequency of each element. The first element that has a frequency of 1 is the first unique element, and we return its index.\n3. **Return -1 if No Unique Element Exists**: If we finish iterating through the array without finding any unique elements, we return -1.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_first_unique(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    counts = Counter(arr)\n    for index, num in enumerate(arr):\n        if counts[num] == 1:\n            return index\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to create a dictionary where keys are elements from the array and values are their respective counts.\n2. **Finding the First Unique Element**: We iterate over the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the element. For each element, we check its count in the dictionary. If the count is 1, we immediately return the index of that element.\n3. **Handling No Unique Elements**: If the loop completes without finding any unique elements, we return -1 to indicate that no unique element exists in the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the first unique element by leveraging the frequency count, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.",
