  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called find_index_of_five that takes a list of integers as input. The function should check if the list contains the number 5. If it does, it returns the index of the first occurrence of 5; otherwise, it returns -1.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Well, I know that in Python, the list has an index method which returns the index of the first occurrence of the value. So, maybe I can use that. But wait, what if the value isn't present? The index method raises a ValueError. So I need to handle that case.\n\nHmm, so another approach is to loop through each element of the list and check if it's 5. When I find the first 5, I return its index. If I go through the entire list without finding a 5, I return -1.\n\nLet's outline the steps. The function will take the list as input. Initialize a loop counter starting from 0. For each element in the list, check if it's equal to 5. If yes, return the current index (which is the loop counter). If the loop completes without finding 5, return -1.\n\nSo how to implement this. Maybe using a for loop with range. Like for i in range(len(numbers)): and inside, if numbers[i] == 5: return i. After the loop, return -1.\n\nYes, that should work. Let me test some cases in my mind.\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The function should return 4, since index starts at 0.\n\nTest case 2: [1,5,2,3,4,6], returns 1.\n\nTest case 3: [1,2,3,4,6], returns -1.\n\nTest case 4: [5,1,2,3,4,6], returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: empty list, should return -1.\n\nThat's all covered.\n\nNow, thinking about possible edge cases. What if the list has multiple fives? Like [5,5,5], returns index 0.\n\nYes, because we return the first occurrence.\n\nAnother edge case: numbers contains other data types? But the function specifies it's a List[int], so we don't have to handle that.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nThe function definition is given as:\n\ndef find_index_of_five(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n\nSo I'll loop through each index.\n\nAnother thing to think about: using list comprehension or any built-in functions, but a simple loop seems straightforward.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):\n    if numbers[i] == 5:\n        return i\nreturn -1\n\nYes, that's simple and efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a try-except block with the index method.\n\nLike:\n\ntry:\n    return numbers.index(5)\nexcept ValueError:\n    return -1\n\nThis is shorter, but maybe the loop is more efficient in some way? I'm not sure. But both methods should work.\n\nI think the try-except approach is cleaner and more Pythonic, so let's go with that.\n\nWait, but is the index method O(n) as well? Yes, because it has to scan the list until it finds the 5 if it exists, else goes through the entire list. So in terms of time complexity, both approaches are the same.\n\nUsing the built-in function is more concise, so using that would be better.\n\nSo the code becomes:\n\ndef find_index_of_five(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n    try:\n        return numbers.index(5)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: [1,2,3,4,5,6] \u2192 4. Correct.\n\nSample 2: [1,5,2,3,4,6] \u2192 1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: [1,2,3,4,6] \u2192 -1. Correct.\n\nSample 4: [5,1,2,3,4,6] \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nSample 5: [] \u2192 -1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThis method is more readable and clean. So the code should be written using the try-except block with the index method.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given list of integers contains the number 5. If it does, we return the index of its first occurrence. If it doesn't, we return -1. \n\n### Approach\nThe goal is to efficiently check for the presence of the number 5 in the list and determine its position. We can leverage Python's built-in list method `index()`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value. If the value is not found, this method raises a `ValueError`. We can handle this exception to return -1 when 5 is not found. This approach is both concise and efficient, working in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_index_of_five(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n    try:\n        return numbers.index(5)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to check if the list contains the number 5 and find its first occurrence's index. The list can be empty or contain multiple instances of 5, but we only care about the first occurrence.\n2. **Approach Selection**: Using the `index()` method is efficient because it directly searches for the value and returns its index if found. Handling the `ValueError` allows us to return -1 if 5 is not present.\n3. **Implementation**: The function attempts to find 5 using `numbers.index(5)`. If successful, it returns the index. If not, it catches the `ValueError` and returns -1.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles empty lists and lists without the number 5 by returning -1 in both cases. It also correctly returns the first occurrence of 5 even if there are multiple instances.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and cleanly solve the problem with minimal code, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities.",
