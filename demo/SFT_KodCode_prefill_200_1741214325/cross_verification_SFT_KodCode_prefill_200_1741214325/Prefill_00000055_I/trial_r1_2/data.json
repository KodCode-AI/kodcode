  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function to check if two strings are isomorphic. Hmm, let's start by understanding what isomorphic strings are. From what I remember, two strings s1 and s2 are isomorphic if we can replace each character in s1 with another character to get s2. The key points are that each occurrence of a character in s1 must be replaced with the same character in s2, and different characters in s1 can't map to the same character in s2. Also, the mapping can include a character mapping to itself.\n\nSo, the first thing that comes to mind is that we need to check two things: whether each character in s1 maps to exactly one character in s2 and vice versa. Also, the structure of the two strings must be such that the pattern of characters is the same.\n\nLet me think about an example. Like, \"egg\" and \"add\" are isomorphic because 'e' maps to 'a' and 'g' maps to 'd'. But \"foo\" and \"bar\" wouldn't be because 'f' maps to 'b' and 'o' to 'a', but 'r' isn't present in \"foo\", which might not be an issue since we only care about the mapping from s1 to s2. Wait, no, actually, both strings must have the same length for them to be isomorphic, so \"foo\" and \"bar\" which are both length 3 can be considered. Wait, no, \"foo\" is length 3 and \"bar\" is also 3, but \"foo\" maps 'f' to 'b' and 'o' to 'a', but 'r' isn't being mapped from s1. Wait, no, s2 has 'r', which is not present in s1. So maybe s2 can have unique characters that are not in s1? Or does it matter?\n\nWait, actually, the isomorphic relationship is a bijection between the characters of s1 to s2. So each character in s1 must map to exactly one in s2, and each character in s2 must be mapped by exactly one character in s1. So the number of unique characters in both strings must be the same.\n\nFor example, \"abb\" and \"bbc\" are isomorphic because a\u2192b, b\u2192c. So both have two unique characters.\n\nBut \"aab\" and \"bbc\" would not be isomorphic because 'a'\u2192'b' and 'b'\u2192'c', but 'a' appears twice and so does 'b' in \"bbc\". No, wait, \"aab\" is aab and \"bbc\" is bbc. Let me check. So \"aab\" and \"bbc\" both have a pattern where the first two are the same and the last is different. Wait, yes, so they are isomorphic because a maps to b and b maps to c. Wait, but in \"aab\", the first two are 'a's and the last is 'b'. In \"bbc\", the first two are 'b's and last is 'c'. So the mapping is a\u2192b and b\u2192c, so yes, it should be isomorphic.\n\nWait, but another example: s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\". Are they isomorphic? Because a\u2192b and b\u2192a. So yes, they are isomorphic because it's a bijection. So in this case, each character maps to exactly one in the other string, and the structure is the same.\n\nSo, the function needs to check two things:\n\n1. The structure of the two strings is the same in terms of the pattern of characters. For example, the nth occurrence of each unique character in s1 should correspond to the same position in s2.\n\n2. The mapping is bijective, meaning that each character in s1 maps to a unique character in s2, and each character in s2 is mapped by exactly one character in s1.\n\nSo, how can I implement this?\n\nOne approach is to create two dictionaries: one for mapping s1 to s2 and another for mapping s2 to s1. As we iterate through each character pair (c1 from s1 and c2 from s2), we check if c1 is already in the mapping. If it is, we verify that the corresponding value is c2. Similarly, we check if c2 is already in the reverse mapping, and ensure it's mapped to c1. If any of these conditions fail, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\nBut wait, we need to process each character in order. Also, both strings must be of the same length; otherwise, they can't be isomorphic. So first, check if their lengths are equal. If not, return False.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. If the lengths of s1 and s2 are different, return False.\n\n2. Create two dictionaries: map1 for s1 to s2, and map2 for s2 to s1.\n\n3. Iterate through each pair of characters (c1, c2) from s1 and s2.\n\n4. For each pair:\n   a. If c1 is in map1, check if map1[c1] == c2. If not, return False.\n   b. If c2 is in map2, check if map2[c2] == c1. If not, return False.\n   c. If neither, add map1[c1] = c2 and map2[c2] = c1.\n\n5. If all pairs pass, return True.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the structure is the same but the mappings are conflicting? Let's test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\ns1 = \"egg\", s2 = \"add\"\nIndex 0: e\u2192a. map1: {'e':'a'}, map2: {'a':'e'}\nIndex 1: g\u2192d. Not in any maps. Add map1['g']='d', map2['d']='g'\nIndex 2: g\u2192d. Already in maps. Okay.\nSo returns True. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\"\nFirst character: a\u2192b. map1: a\u2192b, map2: b\u2192a\nSecond character: b\u2192a. Check map1: b is not there, so add map1[b]=a. But wait, now map1['b']='a', but map2 had 'a' not yet mapped. So let's see:\n\nIteration 1 (s1[0]=a, s2[0]=b):\n- map1[a] = b\n- map2[b] = a\n\nIteration 2 (s1[1]=b, s2[1]=a):\n- Check map1: b not in map1, so proceed.\n- Check map2: a is not in map2, so proceed.\n- Add map1[b] = a\n- Add map2[a] = b\nBut now, in map2, 'b' maps back to 'a' from a, and 'a' maps to 'b' from b. But this is a problem because map2 should be the inverse of map1, but since a maps to b and b maps to a, that's okay because it's a bijection. So the function returns True. Which is correct, as \"ab\" and \"ba\" are isomorphic.\n\nAnother example: s1 = \"foo\", s2 = \"bar\"\nWait, s1 is \"foo\" and s2 is \"bar\". Let's see:\n\ns1: f, o, o\ns2: b, a, r\n\nLength is same. Now, mapping:\n\nf maps to b.\no maps to a, but o occurs again in s1, so in s2, the next character should be a, which it is, but wait, in s2, the third character is r, not a. So in s1, o maps to a, but in s2, the third character is r. So the third pair is o\u2192r, which is different from o\u2192a. So the function should catch that.\n\nIn this case, during the third iteration:\n\nc1 is o, which is in map1 with value a. c2 is r. So since map1[c1] (a) != c2 (r), function returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"paper\", s2 = \"title\"\n\nCheck:\n\np\u2192t, a\u2192i, e\u2192l, r\u2192e\n\nBut wait, in s1: p a p e r\ns2: t i t l e\n\nWait, but let's write s1 = \"paper\" \u2192 'p','a','p','e','r'\n\ns2 = \"title\" \u2192 't','i','t','l','e'\n\nWait, so p\u2192t\n\na\u2192i\n\np (third char) should map to t (third in s2 is t, which is okay)\n\ne\u2192l\n\nr\u2192e\n\nSo the fifth character in s1 is 'r' which maps to 'e' in s2.\n\nBut in map1, r maps to e. But let's see if there's any conflict in the reverse mapping.\n\nIn map2:\n\nt maps to p,\n\ni maps to a,\n\nl maps to e,\n\ne maps to r.\n\nIs that a bijection? Yes, because each character in s1 maps to a unique in s2 and vice versa.\n\nWait, so in s2, e appears once, mapped from r. So the function returns True.\n\nWait, no, in s1, the string is 'p a p e r', which would translate in s2 as t i t l e. So is that correct? Because p maps to t, a to i, p to t, e to l, r to e. So yes, it's isomorphic.\n\nSo according to the function, it would pass.\n\nBut maybe I should try more test cases.\n\nLet me try another example where it's not isomorphic. Say s1 = \"aba\", s2 = \"bab\".\n\ns1: a b a\n\ns2: b a b\n\nSo, the mapping would be a\u2192b and b\u2192a.\n\nSo the function would accept this as True. Because:\n\nFirst pair: a\u2192b. No issues.\n\nSecond pair: b\u2192a. Check map1: b is not mapped yet, so add. Also, check map2: a is not mapped yet, so add. So when processing b, it's allowed because both mappings are consistent.\n\nWait, no. So the first pair is a\u2192b. map1[a]=b, map2[b]=a.\n\nSecond pair is b\u2192a. Check if map1 has b: no, so add it with a. map2, check if a is mapped: no, so add as b.\n\nBut now, when mapping the third character, which is a\u2192b. So during the third iteration, c1 is a, map1[a] is b. c2 is b. So  map1[a] == c2 (b) \u2192 yes.\n\nmap2[c2] = map2[b] = a, which should equal c1 (a). So yes.\n\nSo function returns True, which is correct because \"aba\" and \"bab\" are isomorphic.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"a\", s2 = \"a\". They should be isomorphic because the mapping is a\u2192a.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"aaa\", s2 = \"bbb\". Yes, they are isomorphic because all a's map to b's.\n\nNow, let's think about a case where two characters in s1 map to the same in s2. For example, s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"aa\". Then during the first iteration: a\u2192a. Second iteration: b\u2192a. Now, in map1, a is already mapped to a, and we try to add b\u2192a. But in map2, a is already mapped to a from s1's a, but now we are adding a\u2192b, which conflicts. Because when processing the second pair (b,a):\n\nCheck map1: b is not in map1, proceed.\n\nCheck map2: a is already in map2 as mapped from a (s1's a). So when we try to add a mapping from s2's a to b, it's a conflict because a was already mapped to a. So function returns False, which is correct, because s1 has two different characters mapping to the same, which is invalid.\n\nWait, let's walk through this:\n\ns1 = \"ab\"\n\ns2 = \"aa\"\n\nFirst iteration: c1='a', c2='a'\n\nmap1[a] = a\n\nmap2[a] = a\n\nSecond iteration: c1='b', c2='a'\n\nCheck map1: 'b' not in map1.\n\nCheck map2: 'a' is in map2, and map2['a'] is 'a' which is not equal to c1 ('b'). So we return False. Correct.\n\nSo the function correctly identifies that the mapping is invalid.\n\nAnother case where s1 has more unique characters than s2.\n\ns1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\"\n\nHere, each character in s1 maps to a unique in s2, which is allowed. So function returns True.\n\nBut wait, what if s2 had only two unique characters. For example:\n\ns1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"dde\"\n\nSo in s1, a, b, c. In s2: d, d, e.\n\nSo mapping a\u2192d, b\u2192d. Oh, but that's two different characters in s1 mapping to the same in s2, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nc1 and c2 pairs:\n\na\u2192d: map1[a] = d, map2[d] = a\n\nb\u2192d: check map1[b] is not present, but map2[d] is a. So when we try to set map1[b] = d, we check if map2 has d. It does, and it's a. So we need to check if the current c1 (b) equals map2[d] (a). Since b != a, return False. So correctly identifies that it's not isomorphic.\n\nI think this covers a lot of cases. So the plan is:\n\n- Check if lengths are equal. If not, return False.\n\n- Initialize two dictionaries, map_s1 and map_s2.\n\n- Iterate over each pair (c1, c2) from s1 and s2:\n\n   For each pair:\n\n   - If c1 is in map_s1:\n\n      if map_s1[c1] != c2, return False.\n\n   - Else:\n\n      add map_s1[c1] = c2.\n\n   Similarly,\n\n   - If c2 is in map_s2:\n\n      if map_s2[c2] != c1, return False.\n\n   - Else:\n\n      add map_s2[c2] = c1.\n\n- If all pairs pass, return True.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n\n        return False\n\n    map_s1 = {}\n\n    map_s2 = {}\n\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n\n        if c1 in map_s1:\n\n            if map_s1[c1] != c2:\n\n                return False\n\n        else:\n\n            map_s1[c1] = c2\n\n        if c2 in map_s2:\n\n            if map_s2[c2] != c1:\n\n                return False\n\n        else:\n\n            map_s2[c2] = c1\n\n    return True\n\nWait, let's test this function with the earlier examples.\n\nTest case 1:\n\ns1 = \"egg\", s2 = \"add\"\n\nLength same.\n\nIteration 1: c1='e', c2='a'\n\nmap_s1[e] = a\n\nmap_s2[a] = e\n\nIteration 2: c1='g', c2='d'\n\nmap_s1[g] = d\n\nmap_s2[d] = g\n\nIteration 3: c1='g', c2='d'\n\nmap_s1 checks g is mapped to d == c2, yes.\n\nmap_s2 checks d is mapped back to g == c1, yes.\n\nReturn True.\n\nGood.\n\nTest case 2:\n\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\"\n\nIteration 1: a\u2192b\n\nmap_s1[a] = b\n\nmap_s2[b] = a\n\nIteration 2: b\u2192a\n\nCheck map_s1: b not present, so add b\u2192a.\n\nCheck map_s2: a not present, so add a\u2192b.\n\nWait, but in the function, after adding b\u2192a, it then checks if in map_s2, a is not present, so adds map_s2[a] = b.\n\nWait, no, no: in the second iteration, c1 is 'b' and c2 is 'a'.\n\nSo, in the second iteration:\n\nmap_s1: 'a' is present and points to 'b'. Now, 'b' is not in map_s1, so add 'b' \u2192 'a'.\n\nThen, check c2 which is 'a' in map_s2.\n\nIs 'a' in map_s2? Initially, map_s2 has 'b' mapped to 'a', not 'a'. So 'a' is not in map_s2, so add 'a' \u2192 'b'.\n\nProceed, no errors. So function returns True. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"foo\", s2 = \"bar\"\n\nLength 3.\n\nIteration 1: 'f' \u2192 'b'\n\nmap_s1: f\u2192b\n\nmap_s2: b\u2192f\n\nIter 2: 'o' \u2192 'a'\n\nmap_s1: o\u2192a\n\nmap_s2: a\u2192o\n\nIter 3: 'o' \u2192 'r'\n\nIn map_s1, o is present and must be a. But c2 is r. So  a != r \u2192 condition fails. Return False. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where s1 and s2 are empty strings: should return True. Because they are trivially isomorphic.\n\nWhat about s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\"?\n\nEach character is unique.\n\nFunction:\n\nmap_s1:\n\na\u2192d\n\nb\u2192e\n\nc\u2192f\n\nmap_s2:\n\nd\u2192a\n\ne\u2192b\n\nf\u2192c\n\nNo conflicts, so return True. Correct.\n\nWhat about s1 = \"aabb\", s2 = \"bbaa\"\n\nWait, s1: a a b b\n\ns2: b b a a\n\nThe structure is same? Let's see.\n\nSo:\n\nIndices 0: a\u2192b\n\n1: a\u2192b (same as before)\n\n2: b\u2192a (new mapping)\n\n3: b\u2192a\n\nBut when processing index 2:\n\nCheck c1 = b, c2 = a.\n\nmap_s1: b is not present, so add b\u2192a.\n\nCheck map_s2: a is not present, add a\u2192b.\n\nNo conflict.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nmap_s1: {'a':'b', 'b':'a'}, map_s2: {'b':'a', 'a':'b'}\n\nSo, it's a bijection. So function returns True, but are these isomorphic?\n\nYes, because the pattern is same and mapping is consistent.\n\nSo function correctly returns True.\n\nI think the function should cover all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to ensure that each character in one string can be replaced to form the other string while maintaining a consistent and unique mapping in both directions.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. **Check Lengths:** If the lengths of the two strings are different, they cannot be isomorphic.\n2. **Create Mappings:** Use two dictionaries to maintain mappings from characters in the first string to the second and vice versa.\n3. **Iterate and Map:** For each character pair from the two strings, check if the current mappings are consistent. If not, the strings are not isomorphic. If they remain consistent throughout, the strings are isomorphic.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    map_s1 = {}\n    map_s2 = {}\n    \n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in map_s1:\n            if map_s1[c1] != c2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            map_s1[c1] = c2\n        \n        if c2 in map_s2:\n            if map_s2[c2] != c1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            map_s2[c2] = c1\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Length Check:** The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, it returns `False`.\n- **Mapping Consistency:** For each character pair, it ensures that each character in `s1` maps to exactly one character in `s2` and vice versa. If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.\n- **Bijection:** The use of two dictionaries ensures that the mapping is bidirectional, maintaining the required bijection for isomorphism.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the isomorphic property in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the strings, ensuring optimal performance.",
