  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to determine if two strings s1 and s2 are isomorphic. Hmm, isomorphic means that each character in s1 can be replaced to get s2, right? So all occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character, but the order has to stay the same. Also, no two different characters can map to the same character, but a character can map to itself. Alright, that makes sense.\n\nFirst, I think about what conditions need to be met for two strings to be isomorphic. Well, the first thing is that their lengths must be the same. Because if s1 is longer than s2 or vice versa, you can't possibly replace each character one-to-one. So the function should immediately return False if len(s1) != len(s2). That's a quick check.\n\nNext, I need to handle the mapping between characters. I should probably create two dictionaries: one to map characters from s1 to s2 and another to map from s2 back to s1. Because for the strings to be isomorphic, this mapping has to be bijective, meaning each character in s1 maps to a unique character in s2, and each character in s2 is mapped to by exactly one character in s1. So if I have a situation where two different characters in s1 map to the same character in s2, that's not allowed. Similarly, if a character in s2 is mapped by more than one character in s1, that's also a problem.\n\nSo, I'll loop through each pair of characters from s1 and s2. For each pair (c1, c2), I'll check:\n\n1. If c1 is already in the s1_to_s2 dictionary. If it is, then the current c2 must be equal to the value in the dictionary. Otherwise, it's not isomorphic.\n2. Similarly, if c2 is already in the s2_to_s1 dictionary, the current c1 must equal its value. Otherwise, it's not isomorphic.\n3. If both checks pass, then I'll add c1 to s1_to_s2 and c2 to s2_to_s1 with their respective mappings.\n\nIf any of these checks fail during the iteration, the function returns False. If the entire loop completes without issues, then the strings are isomorphic, so return True.\n\nWait, but what about when a character maps to itself? Like, if s1 is \"a\" and s2 is \"a\", then the mapping is valid. So the above logic shouldn't prevent that.\n\nLet me think of some test cases. For example:\n\nTest case 1:\ns1 = \"egg\"\ns2 = \"add\"\nThey should be isomorphic. The mapping is e->a, g->d.\n\nTest case 2:\ns1 = \"foo\"\ns2 = \"bar\"\nNot isomorphic because f maps to b, o maps to a and r. But o can't map to two different characters.\n\nWait, in this case, the second o would map to r, which differs from the first o in s2. Wait, no, s1 is \"foo\": f, o, o. s2 is \"bar\": b, a, r. So in s2, the second o maps to r, but the first o maps to a. That's a problem because in s1, all o's should map to the same character. So this won't be isomorphic.\n\nAnother test case where it's valid: s1 = \"abcd\", s2 = \"dcba\". Each character maps uniquely, so they are isomorphic.\n\nWhat about if one string is longer? Like s1 is \"abc\", s2 is \"abcd\". Our first check will catch that because their lengths are different.\n\nWhat about if the mappings are correct, but in s2, a new character appears that isn't mapped properly? Like s1=\"aab\", s2=\"ccb\". That should be isomorphic: a->c, b->b. So the function should return True.\n\nWait, another example: s1 = \"a\", s2 = \"b\". That's isomorphic because the single character maps to another single character.\n\nBut what if s1 is \"ab\", s2 is \"aa\"? Then, in s1, a and b both map to a. So that's not allowed because two different characters in s1 can't map to the same in s2. So the function should return False here.\n\nSo, the dictionaries must ensure that each key in s1 has a unique value, and each value in s2 has a unique key.\n\nAlright, so putting it all together. I'll write the function step by step.\n\n1. Check if lengths are equal. If not, return False.\n2. Initialize two empty dictionaries: s1_map and s2_map.\n3. Iterate over each pair of characters from s1 and s2.\n   a. For the current c1 and c2:\n   b. If c1 is in s1_map:\n      i. If s1_map[c1] != c2, return False.\n   c. Else:\n      i. Check if c2 is in s2_map. Because if c2 is already mapped by another character, it's invalid. So if c2 is in s2_map and s2_map[c2] is not c1, then return False.\n      ii. If c2 is not in s2_map, add c1 to s1_map and c2 to s2_map.\n   d. Wait, but step 3c seems like it needs more precise logic.\n\nWait, perhaps for each c1, c2 pair:\n\n- If c1 is not in s1_map:\n   Then c2 must not be in s2_map. Because if c2 is already mapped by another c1, which is different from current c1, it's a conflict. So in that case, return False.\n- Conversely, if c2 is not in s2_map, you can add both mappings.\n\nBut wait, think of the example s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"cd\". Both are isomorphic.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration:\n\nc1 is 'a', not in s1_map. c2 is 'c', not in s2_map. So add a->c and c->a.\n\nSecond iteration: c1 is 'b', not in s1_map. c2 is 'd', not in s2_map. So add b->d and d->b. So this would work.\n\nAnother example: s1 = \"aa\", s2 = \"bb\". This is isomorphic because a maps to b. So during the first iteration:\n\nc1='a' not in s1_map, c2='b' not in s2_map. Add a->b and b->a.\n\nSecond iteration: c1='a' is in s1_map, s1_map[a] is 'b' which equals c2='b'. So it's okay.\n\nAnother example: s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"aa\". First, len is 2 vs 2.\n\nc1='a', not in s1_map, c2='a' not in s2_map. Add a->a and a->a.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, in the first step, c1 is 'a', c2 is 'a'.\n\nBut s1_map doesn't have 'a' yet, so I check if c2 is in s2_map. But c2 is 'a', and is it in s2_map? s2_map is empty, so no. So then, add a->a to s1_map, and a->a to s2_map.\n\nNext iteration: c1 is 'b', not in s1_map, c2 is 'a', which is in s2_map as s2_map['a'] is 'a'. But now, I need to check if 'b' can map to 'a' without conflicting.\n\nWait, but adding 'b'->'a' would mean that 'a' in s2 is being mapped by both 'a' and 'b' in s1, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, so when processing (b, a):\n\nCheck if 'b' is in s1_map? No.\n\nThen check if 'a' is in s2_map? Yes. It's there, with s2_map['a'] = 'a'.\n\nSo for (b, a): since 'a' is already mapped by 'a', which is different from 'b', this should not be allowed. So this function should return False.\n\nHmm. So in the code, for each pair:\n\nIf c1 is not in s1_map:\n\n   If c2 is not in s2_map:\n\n       s1_map[c1] = c2\n\n       s2_map[c2] = c1\n\n   Else:\n\n       return False\n\nElse:\n\n   if s1_map[c1] != c2:\n\n       return False\n\nSo in the case of s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"aa\", here's how it goes:\n\nIteration 1: c1=a, c2=a.\n\na is not in s1_map. c2 a is not in s2_map. So add a->a in s1_map, a->a in s2_map.\n\nIteration 2: c1=b, c2=a.\n\nb is not in s1_map. Check c2=a: is it in s2_map? Yes. So return False.\n\nWhich is correct because \"ab\" and \"aa\" are not isomorphic.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"paper\", s2 = \"title\". Should be isomorphic.\n\ns1: p a p e r\n\ns2: t i t l e\n\nMapping p->t, a->i, e->l, r->e.\n\nLet's see how the code would handle it:\n\nLoop through each character:\n\n1. p and t: neither in their maps. Add p->t and t->p.\n2. a and i: add a->i and i->a.\n3. p and t: check if s1_map[p] is t, which it is. Proceed.\n4. e and l: add e->l and l->e.\n5. r and e: add r->e and e->r.\n\nWait, but now s2_map has l->e and e->r? Wait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in step 4: mapping e to l. So s2_map will have l: e.\n\nIn step 5: c2 is e. So s2_map doesn't have e yet? Because in step 4, c2 was l.\n\nWait, in step 4, c1 is e, c2 is l. So s2_map adds l: e.\n\nIn step 5: c1 is r, c2 is e.\n\nCheck if c2 (e) is in s2_map? s2_map has keys t, i, l.\n\nSo e is not in s2_map. So proceed to add r->e and e->r.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, in this case, the mapping is correct. Because:\n\npaper -> t i t l e\n\nSo each character maps correctly. Therefore, the function should return True.\n\nBut wait, in this case, during mapping, when c2 is e, it's not in s2_map, so it adds r->e and e->r. That's okay.\n\nSo the function would return True, which is correct.\n\nBut now I notice that in this case, the s2_map would have e: r, but in step 5, the c2 is e which is being mapped to r.\n\nBut what about the l in s2 corresponds to e in s1, and e in s1 is now mapping to l? Wait no: e in s1 is mapped to l in step 4, but then in step5, r in s1 maps to e in s2. So s2_map's l is e, and e is r.\n\nWait, but s2_map is supposed to map s2 characters back to s1.\n\nSo in s2_map:\n\nt: p\ni: a\nl: e\ne: r\n\nSo in this case, yes, it's correct. Because l is mapped to e, and e is mapped to r.\n\nSo the code logic should handle that correctly.\n\nBut is this the correct way to handle the mappings?\n\nI think yes, because for each c1 in s1, we assign a corresponding c2 in s2, making sure that the assignments are bijective.\n\nAnother test case where s1 is \"hello\" and s2 is \"hello\". They are isomorphic because each character maps to itself.\n\nSo the function should return True.\n\nWhat about s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"ceils\"? Let's see:\n\nh -> c, e ->e, l->i, o->s.\n\nWait, wait, \"hello\" is h e l l o, and s2 is \"ceils\": c e i l s.\n\nSo:\n\nh maps to c\n\ne maps to e\n\nl maps to i, l maps to i, which is fine.\n\no maps to s.\n\nBut let's process each character:\n\n1. h and c: add h->c, c->h.\n\n2. e and e: add e->e, e->e.\n\n3. l and i: add l->i, i->l.\n\n4. l and i: check s1_map[l]=i, which matches c2 i.\n\n5. o and s: add o->s, s->o.\n\nSo all conditions are satisfied, returns True.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\"? Should be isomorphic since a unique mapping exists.\n\nSo:\n\na->d\n\nb->e\n\nc->f\n\nAnd the reverse:\n\nd->a, e->b, f->c.\n\nSo the code should return True.\n\nAlright, I think the logic is solid. So now, I need to code this.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nFunction is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n\n   if len(s1) != len(s2): return False\n\n   s1_map = {}\n\n   s2_map = {}\n\n   for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n\n       if c1 in s1_map:\n\n           if s1_map[c1] != c2:\n\n               return False\n\n       else:\n\n           if c2 in s2_map:\n\n               return False\n\n           s1_map[c1] = c2\n\n           s2_map[c2] = c1\n\n       if c2 in s2_map:\n\n           if s2_map[c2] != c1:\n\n               return False\n\n       else:\n\n           # Already handled above?\n\n           # Wait, no, because if c2 was just added in the else clause, then here is redundant.\n\n           # Hmm, maybe the logic is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial code isn't sufficient. Because in the case where c1 isn't in s1_map, and c2 isn't in s2_map, we add both. But during that adding, it's possible that in a subsequent step, a conflict could arise.\n\nWait, no, because once c2 is in s2_map, any future c1 trying to map to c2 would have to match s2_map[c2].\n\nWait, in the code, for each c1, c2:\n\nIf c1 is in s1_map, check if s1_map[c1] equals c2.\n\nElse, check if c2 is in s2_map. If yes, return False. Because another c1 has already mapped to this c2.\n\nElse, add c1->c2 and c2->c1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in some cases, the forward and reverse mappings could get out of sync.\n\nWait, let's take an example where s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\".\n\ns1: a, b\n\ns2: b, a\n\nSo in the first iteration: c1='a', c2='b'\n\nNeither is in their maps, so add a->b and b->a.\n\nSecond iteration: c1='b', c2='a'\n\nCheck if 'b' is in s1_map? Yes, s1_map[b] isn't set yet.\n\nWait, no. After the first iteration, s1_map has a: b, s2_map has b: a.\n\nIn second iteration: c1='b', which is not in s1_map. So check if c2='a' is in s2_map? s2_map has 'b' and 'a' is not in s2_map yet. So then, add b->a and a->b.\n\nSo s2_map now has b->a and a->b.\n\nWhich is correct because a is mapped to b, which is mapped back to a.\n\nBut in the end, the function should return True because they are isomorphic.\n\nWait, but in reality, s1 \"ab\" and s2 \"ba\" are isomorphic because a<->b and b<->a.\n\nSo code returns True correctly.\n\nWait, but s1 is \"ab\" (a and b), s2 is \"ba\" (b and a). So the code correctly identifies it as isomorphic.\n\nWhat about when s1 is \"aa\" and s2 is \"ab\"?\n\nFirst, len(s1) = len(s2) = 2.\n\nIterate:\n\n1. c1='a', c2='a'\n\nNeither is in maps. Add a->a in s1_map and a->a in s2_map.\n\n2. c1='a', c2='b'\n\nCheck if 'a' is in s1_map. Yes, which has value 'a'. Now check if 'a' != 'b'? Yes. So return False.\n\nWhich is correct because \"aa\" and \"ab\" are not isomorphic.\n\nWait, \"aa\" to \"ab\": the second 'a' is supposed to map to 'b' which differs from the first 'a' mapping to 'a'\u2014so not isomorphic.\n\nSo function correctly returns False.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"aba\", s2 = \"bab\"\n\nSo s1: a, b, a\n\ns2: b, a, b\n\nProcessing:\n\n1. a and b: both not in maps. Add a->b, b->a.\n\n2. b and a: add b->a, a->b.\n\nWait, but in step 2: c1='b' is not in s1_map. So c2='a' is in s2_map? s2_map currently has b->a, but 'a' is not in s2_map yet.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, after first iteration: s2_map[b] = a.\n\nIn second iteration: c1='b', c2='a'. So check if 'b' is in s1_map: no.\n\nCheck if c2='a' is in s2_map: s2_map has 'b' as a key, 'a' is not a key in s2_map yet. So it's safe to add b->a and a->b.\n\nSo now, s1_map:\n\na: b, b: a.\n\ns2_map:\n\nb: a, a: b.\n\nThird iteration: c1='a', c2='b'.\n\nCheck s1_map[a] is 'b' which matches c2='b'. So proceed.\n\nThus, function returns True, which is correct because \"aba\" and \"bab\" are isomorphic.\n\nAlright, so I think the code logic is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the code for a second. After adding c1->c2 and c2->c1, I should also make sure that s2_map[c2] is indeed c1. But perhaps it's redundant because we just added it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after adding c1 and c2 to the maps, in the same step, just check the reverse.\n\nWait, but in my current code, when we add to the maps, and then later c2 is encountered as c1 in a next iteration, the code will verify it.\n\nNo, perhaps the code is correct as is. Let's think.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps, in addition to the two maps, after adding, we can also check the s2_map to make sure that when we add a new c2, it doesn't conflict with the current s2_map. But perhaps that's already handled.\n\nThus, the code I have in mind should be:\n\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    s1_map = {}\n    s2_map = {}\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in s1_map:\n            if s1_map[c1] != c2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            if c2 in s2_map:\n                return False\n            s1_map[c1] = c2\n            s2_map[c2] = c1\n    return True\n\nWait, but this is missing something because in some cases, the s2_map may not enforce the reverse mapping correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the s2_map isn't being checked correctly. Let me take an example:\n\nSuppose s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"aa\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nc1='a', c2='a':\n\nNot in maps. Add a->a, a->a. Hmm, wait, s2_map will have a: a.\n\nc1='b', c2='a':\n\nCheck if 'b' is in s1_map: No. Check if 'a' is in s2_map: Yes, with value 'a'. So according to the code, return False.\n\nBut let's walk through the code:\n\nIn the second iteration:\n\nc1 is 'b', not in s1_map.\n\nc2 is 'a', which is in s2_map, so return False.\n\nSo the code correctly returns False.\n\nBut wait, what about a case where c2 is already in s2_map but in a different way.\n\nWait, no, in the above code, the check is \"if c2 in s2_map: return False\"\n\nWhich would catch any attempt to map two different c1's to the same c2.\n\nBut let me think about a case where perhaps c2 is in s2_map but it's the same as the c1.\n\nWait, but no. Because if c1 is not in s1_map, but c2 is in s2_map, then s2_map[c2] must be a different c1, which is a conflict.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the code should also verify that when a new c1 is added to s1_map, the corresponding c2 is correctly added to s2_map, and vice versa.\n\nWait, let me check the case when c1 is added and c2 is added, but in the s2_map, perhaps another c1 already exists mapping to c2. No, because in that case, the code would have checked if c2 is in s2_map before adding.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n\nWait, but let's take another example where the function may fail.\n\nSuppose s1 is \"ab\", s2 is \"cd\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nc1='a', c2='c': not in s1_map, not in s2_map. Add a->c, c->a.\n\nc1='b', c2='d': not in s1_map, not in s2_map. Add b->d, d->b.\n\nFunction returns True, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: s1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"cc\".\n\nProcessing:\n\nc1='a', c2='c': not in maps, add a->c, c->a.\n\nc1='b', c2='c': not in s1_map, but c2 'c' is in s2_map, with value 'a'. So return False.\n\nWhich is correct because \"ab\" can't map to \"cc\" since both a and b would have to map to c, which is not allowed.\n\nAnother test case: s1 = \"aaab\", s2 = \"ORED\".\n\nWait, s1 is \"aaa\" + \"b\", and s2 is O R E D.\n\nSo in s1: a, a, a, b.\n\ns2: O, R, E, D.\n\nSo:\n\nc1 a maps to O, R, E, but that's not possible because a occurs three times. So in s2, the first three characters should all be the same.\n\nWait, no, for the strings to be isomorphic, the first three 'a's in s1 should map to the same character in s2.\n\nSo for example, if s2 is \"ORO\", that would not be correct because the second 'a' in s1 maps to 'R' and the third to 'O', which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, but let's take s1 = \"aaaab\", s2 = \"bbbbb\". They are isomorphic because a maps to b.\n\nWait, \"aaaab\" and \"bbbbb\". Are isomorphic because each 'a' maps to 'b' and the last 'b' in s1 maps to 'b' in s2.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nFor each pair:\n\nc1=a, c2=b: add a->b, b->a.\n\nBut wait, in the first iteration:\n\nc1 is a, not in s1_map. c2 is b, not in s2_map.\n\nSo add a->b and b->a.\n\nNext iterations, c1 is a, and c2 is b: mapping is correct.\n\nLast iteration, c1 is b, c2 is b.\n\nCheck c1=b is not in s1_map (since only a is). So check if c2 (b) is in s2_map: yes, s2_map[b] is a. So since c1 is b, which is not in s1_map, and c2 is b which is in s2_map, then return False.\n\nWhich would incorrectly conclude that \"aaaab\" and \"bbbbb\" are not isomorphic.\n\nBut they should be isomorphic because all 'a's map to 'b's and the 'b' maps to 'b'.\n\nHmm, so this is a problem.\n\nSo, this suggests that the code is not handling cases where a character in s1 maps to itself in s2, when another character in s1 maps to it.\n\nWait, in this case:\n\ns1 = \"aaaab\" (a, a, a, a, b)\n\ns2 = \"bbbbb\" (b, b, b, b, b).\n\nSo the code would fail because when processing the fifth character pair (b, b):\n\nc1 is 'b', not in s1_map (since s1_map has 'a': 'b').\n\nc2 is 'b', which is in s2_map as s2_map['b'] = 'a'. So return False.\n\nBut in reality, it's isomorphic because 'a' maps to 'b' and 'b' maps to 'b'. So the code would incorrectly return False.\n\nSo this is a problem. So the current code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, what's wrong here.\n\nThe issue is that the code is trying to enforce that the mapping is bijective (injective and surjective), but in this case, the mapping isn't injective because two different characters are mapping to 'b' in s2.\n\nIn the example above, 'a' in s1 maps to 'b' in s2, and 'b' in s1 also maps to 'b' in s2. So s2's 'b' is being mapped to by both 'a' and 'b' in s1, which violates the condition that two different characters can't map to the same.\n\nWait, but the problem states that no two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.\n\nSo in this case, it's invalid. So is s1=\"aaaab\" and s2=\"bbbbb\" isomorphic? Because 'a' is mapped to 'b', and 'b' is mapped to 'b'. So both 'a' and 'b' are mapped to 'b' in s2, which is not allowed because two different characters can't map to the same.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: \"No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.\"\n\nSo each character in s1 must map to a unique character in s2, and each character in s2 is mapped by only one character in s1.\n\nSo in the case where s1 has \"aaaab\" and s2 has \"bbbbb\", the s1's 'b' is mapping to s2's 'b', which is fine, but the s1's 'a's are all mapping to s2's 'b's. So this means that 'a' and 'b' in s1 are both mapping to 'b' in s2, which violates the rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct isomorphism is not to be found here. So the function correctly returns False.\n\nWait, so what's the confusion then?\n\nWait, no, in the example:\n\ns1 is \"aaaab\", which is a a a a b.\n\ns2 is \"bbbbb\", which is b b b b b.\n\nSo 'a' must map to 'b' in s2, and the 'b' in s1 must map to 'b' in s2.\n\nBut that causes 'a' and 'b' in s1 to both map to 'b' in s2, which is not allowed. So the function correctly returns False.\n\nSo perhaps the code was correct.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier test case where s1 = \"ab\" and s2 = \"ba\", the code correctly returns True.\n\nBut in that case, the mapping is a<->b, which is allowed because each maps to the other. Because each character in s1 is mapped to a unique in s2, and each in s2 is mapped to by only one in s1.\n\nYes, in that case, the function works.\n\nWait, perhaps the earlier test case isn't a problem.\n\nWait, another test case:\n\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"a\": should return True.\n\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"b\": returns True.\n\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"ba\": returns True.\n\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"bb\": returns False.\n\ns1 = \"aaab\", s2 = \"bbba\": Then the code returns True or False?\n\ns1 is a, a, a, b.\n\ns2 is b, b, b, a.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, a->b, check:\n\n- a not in s1_map, b not in s2_map. Add a->b, b->a.\n\nSecond, a and b: a is in s1_map, s1_map[a] is 'b' not equal to 'b' (no, wait c2 is 'b' and s1_map[a] is 'b', so it's correct.\n\nThird, a and b: same.\n\nFourth, b and a:\n\nb not in s1_map. c2='a' is in s2_map (a is not a key yet; wait s2_map has only 'b' with value 'a' now.\n\nWait, in iteration 4:\n\nc1 is 'b', not in s1_map.\n\nc2 is 'a', which is in s2_map? s2_map contains 'b' as a key, 'a' is not yet in s2_map.\n\nWait, no: after first iteration, s2_map is { 'b': 'a' }.\n\nc2='a' is not in s2_map, because s2_map only has 'b' as key.\n\nSo, in iteration 4:\n\nc1='b' not in s1_map, c2='a' not in s2_map. So add 'b'->'a' to s1_map, and add 'a'->'b' to s2_map.\n\nSo after that, s1_map: a->b, b->a.\n\ns2_map: b->a, a->b.\n\nThus, the function returns True, which is correct because \"aaab\" and \"bbba\" are isomorphic.\n\nYes, because:\n\na maps to b,\n\nb maps to a.\n\nWhich makes \"aaab\" to \"bbba\".\n\nBut in the case where s1 is \"aaaab\" and s2 is \"bbbbb\":\n\nThe first four a's map to b, and the last b maps to b. So in the code, when processing the fifth pair, c1='b' not in s1_map, c2='b' in s2_map as 'b' is a key (s2_map['b'] = 'a'). So the addition of 'b' to s1_map as mapping to 'b' would cause the s2_map['b'] to change from 'a' to 'b', which would result in s2_map being inconsistent.\n\nWait, let's step through this:\n\ns1 = \"aaaab\", s2 = \"bbbbb\"\n\nIteration 1: c1='a', c2='b'.\n\ns1_map\u4e3a\u7a7a\uff0cs2_map\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\n\nAdd a\u2192b\uff0cb\u2192a.\n\ns1_map: {'a': 'b'}\n\ns2_map: {'b': 'a'}\n\nIteration 2: c1='a', c2='b'.\n\nCheck s1_map['a'] is 'b' which matches c2, okay.\n\nIteration3: same.\n\nIteration4: same.\n\nIteration5: c1='b', c2='b'.\n\nCheck if 'b' in s1_map: no.\n\nCheck if 'b' is in s2_map: yes (s2_map['b'] = 'a').\n\nThus, since 'b' is inlion is s2_map, and is mapped to 'a', but c1 is 'b' which is not 'a', thus return False.\n\nWhich is correct because it's not isomorphic, as 'a' and 'b' in s1 both map tol 'b' in s2.\n\nSo the function is working correctly.\n\nI think the confusion was that in some cases, the code returns False correctly, but perhaps I had another test case where the code might have issues, but I can't think of any now.\n\nSo, I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about another example: s1 = \"papper\", s2 = \"banana\". Wait, no, probably not isomorphic.\n\nBut perhaps s1 = \"egg\", s2 = \"add\".\n\ns1: e, g, g.\n\ns2: a, d, d.\n\nSo:\n\ne\u2192a, g\u2192d.\n\nThus, isomorphic. The code should return True.\n\nIn step1: e and a: add mappings.\n\nstep2: g and d: add.\n\nstep3: g and d: check and pass.\n\nThus, function returns True, which is correct.\n\nAnother example where many mappings are needed:\n\ns1 = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\ns2 = \"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\"\n\nIn this case, each character maps uniquely, so the function should return True.\n\nYes, the code would correctly map each to the corresponding and return True.\n\nSo, I think the code is solid. Now, implementing it.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if two strings `s1` and `s2` are isomorphic, we need to ensure that each character in `s1` can be replaced to get `s2`, with the condition that each character mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto). This means no two different characters in `s1` can map to the same character in `s2`, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Length Check**: If the lengths of `s1` and `s2` are different, return `False` immediately as they cannot be isomorphic.\n2. **Mapping Dictionaries**: Use two dictionaries to keep track of the mappings:\n   - `s1_map` to map characters from `s1` to `s2`.\n   - `s2_map` to map characters from `s2` back to `s1`, ensuring bijectivity.\n3. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each pair of characters `(c1, c2)` from `s1` and `s2`:\n   - If `c1` is already mapped, ensure it maps to `c2`.\n   - If `c2` is already mapped back by another `c1`, return `False`.\n   - Update both dictionaries with the new mappings if they don't violate the bijectivity condition.\n4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, return `True`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    \n    s1_map = {}\n    s2_map = {}\n    \n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 in s1_map:\n            if s1_map[c1] != c2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            if c2 in s2_map:\n                return False\n            s1_map[c1] = c2\n            s2_map[c2] = c1\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Length Check**: Ensures both strings have the same length, a basic requirement for isomorphism.\n- **Mapping Dictionaries**: `s1_map` ensures each character in `s1` maps to a unique character in `s2`, while `s2_map` ensures each character in `s2` is mapped by exactly one character in `s1`.\n- **Character Pair Processing**: Each character pair is checked for consistency in mapping, updating the dictionaries only when no conflicts arise.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the strings.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the bijective mapping condition, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.",
