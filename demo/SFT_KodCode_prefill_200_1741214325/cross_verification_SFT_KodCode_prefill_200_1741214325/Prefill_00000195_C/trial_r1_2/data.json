  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to mirror a binary tree. Hmm, what does mirroring a binary tree mean exactly? Oh right, it means that the left and right children of every node are swapped. So for each node, if it has a left and right child, after mirroring, the left child becomes the right and the right becomes the left.\n\nLet me think about this. So the input is the root of the tree, and I have to return the root of the mirrored tree. How do I approach this? Maybe with recursion.\n\nWait, recursion is a good approach here. Because for each node, I can swap its left and right children, and then recursively mirror the left and right subtrees. Oh right, but wait, if I just swap the children, that's not enough. Because each subtree also needs to be mirrored.\n\nSo here's the plan: For each node, first check if it's None. If not, proceed. Then, swap its left and right child. Then recursively mirror the left child and the right child. That ensures that every level of the tree is mirrored.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Let me think. If I have a tree where node A has left child B and right child C, and C has its own left D and right E. When I mirror A, the children are swapped. So now A's left is C and right is B. But I also need to mirror the subtrees. So after swapping, I have to mirror each of the new left and right subtrees.\n\nSo for the node A: swap left and right. Then mirror the left (which was C) and mirror the right (which was B). This way, all subtrees are mirrored correctly.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. If the node is None, return None.\n2. Otherwise, create a copy of the node or perhaps just swap the left and right pointers.\nWait, wait no. Maybe we don't need to create a new tree. We can actually modify the existing tree. Or maybe the problem is to create a new mirrored tree. Let me look at the examples.\n\nIn the example, the original root has value 1, with left 2 and right 3. After mirroring, the new root has left 3 and right 2. So it's a new tree or is it a modified one? The function returns a new TreeNode.\n\nWait no, the question says it returns the mirror image. So perhaps the function should take the root as input and return a new root, which is the mirrored version. So it needs to create a new structure.\n\nWait, no, because if I pass a TreeNode(1) as root, the mirrored root is same because it's a single node. Then, in the other example, the root has left and right, and the mirrored root has them swapped.\n\nWait, in the example, root is a TreeNode(1), with left 2 and right 3. So the mirrored root's left is 3 and right is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the function builds a new tree. Because in Python, objects are passed by assignment, but for trees, if we modify the left and right pointers, it may mutate the original tree. But creating a new one is probably better for this problem.\n\nSo that makes me think that each mirror_tree function call should create a new TreeNode with the same value as the current node, and then recursively mirror the left and right children, but assign them swapped.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps should be: for a given node, if it's null, return null. Otherwise, create a new node with the same value. Then, the left child of this new node is the mirror of the original node's right child, and the right child is the mirror of the original node's left child.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if in the original tree, the node has left and right subtrees, then in the mirrored tree, the new node's left is the mirror of the original right, and the new node's right is the mirror of the original left.\n\nThis approach avoids modifying the original tree, and creates a new mirrored tree.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ndef mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    mirrored_node = TreeNode(root.val)\n    mirrored_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    mirrored_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return mirrored_node\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let's see for the sample input.\n\nSample 1: root is a single node 1.\n\nmirror_tree creates a new node with value 1. Both left and right of root are null, so the mirrored node's left is mirror_tree on null (returns null), same for right. So the mirrored root has same structure as original.\n\nSample 2: root is 1, left is 2, right is 3.\n\nnew node is 1.\n\nThen, new node's left is mirror_tree(root.right) which is mirror_tree(3). That root is a node with value 3, and no children. So that returns a node 3.\n\nSimilarly, new node's right is mirror_tree(root.left) which is mirror_tree(2), returns a node 2.\n\nSo the mirrored tree has left child 3 and right child 2, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle the cases.\n\nTesting corner cases: what about a deeper tree.\n\nLet's say the tree is:\n\n       1\n     /   \\\n    2     3\n   / \\   / \\\n  4  5  6  7\n\nMirroring this tree would swap the left and right of each node.\n\nSo the mirrored tree would be:\n\n       1\n     /   \\\n    3     2\n   / \\   / \\\n  7  6  5  4\n\nSo for node 1: left becomes 3's mirrored subtree, right becomes 2's mirrored subtree.\n\nWhich the algorithm would produce correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when a node's left is None. For example, the node has only a right child. Then, the mirrored tree would have a left child equal to the mirror of the original's right, which in turn if that has no children, would have a left and right of null. So it swaps correctly.\n\nSo I think this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the function is as follows: it creates a new node for each original node, and assigns the left and right children recursively by swapping left and right in the mirror method.\n\nWait, but the function is given the root of the original tree. Does it create a new structure, or does it modify the existing one? The problem statement shows that for root = TreeNode(1) with certain children, the mirrored_root's left and right have different values. So in that case, the original root is not modified because mirrored_root is a separate node.\n\nSo the function must create a new TreeNode for each node in the original tree, and recursively set the left and right children as per the mirror.\n\nTherefore, the approach I have is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the node's left and right are None? The code handles that, because if left or right is None, the function returns None.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about large trees? I think the code would handle them as well because it's a standard recursive approach.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create the mirror image of a given binary tree. The mirroring of a binary tree involves swapping the left and right children of each node at every level of the tree.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use recursion. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None` because there's nothing to mirror.\n2. **Create a New Node**: For each node in the original tree, create a new node with the same value.\n3. **Recursive Mirroring**: Recursively mirror the right subtree and assign it to the left child of the new node. Similarly, recursively mirror the left subtree and assign it to the right child of the new node. This ensures that each level of the tree is mirrored correctly.\n4. **Return the New Node**: After setting the left and right children, return the new node.\n\nThis approach ensures that we create a new mirrored tree without modifying the original tree.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    mirrored_node = TreeNode(root.val)\n    mirrored_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    mirrored_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return mirrored_node\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input node is `None`. If it is, the function returns `None` because there's nothing to process.\n2. **Node Creation**: A new `TreeNode` is created with the same value as the current node in the original tree.\n3. **Recursive Mirroring**: The function recursively processes the right subtree of the original node and assigns the result to the left child of the new node. Similarly, it processes the left subtree and assigns it to the right child of the new node. This step effectively swaps the left and right children at each level.\n4. **Return Mirrored Node**: Finally, the function returns the new node, which is the root of the mirrored tree.\n\nThis approach efficiently mirrors the tree using recursion, ensuring that each subtree is correctly mirrored. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive call stack and the storage required for the new mirrored tree.",
