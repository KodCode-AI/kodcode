  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to mirror a binary tree. Hmm, mirroring a binary tree means that for every node, its left and right children are swapped. So, whatever is on the left goes to the right, and vice versa. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function is called mirror_tree and it takes a root node as input, returning the mirrored tree's root. So, the input is a TreeNode, which I believe is a standard binary tree node with 'val', 'left', and 'right' attributes.\n\nWait, so for the base case, if the root is None, I should return None because there's nothing to mirror. That makes sense. So, I'll start by checking if root is None and return it immediately.\n\nNow, for the recursive approach. The idea is that I'll mirror the left and right subtrees and then swap them. So, maybe the steps are:\n1. Mirror the left subtree of the root.\n2. Mirror the right subtree of the root.\n3. Swap the left and right pointers of the root.\n\nWait, no. Actually, maybe a better approach is to create a new tree, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, I can modify the existing tree, but the question says 'returns the mirror image', so I think it's better to construct a new tree so that the original tree remains unchanged. Hmm, but the examples given, like when root has left 2 and right 3, after mirroring, the mirrored root's left is 3 and right is 2. That suggests that either the original is modified, or a new one is built correctly.\n\nWait, but the function is written as a function that returns the mirrored root. So, perhaps the original tree is being modified. Wait no, wait: looking at the sample, in the second example, after creating the root with 1, then left and right children, when mirrored, the mirrored_root's left is 3 and right is 2. So how's that possible if the original tree isn't being modified? So either the original tree's children are being swapped, or perhaps I need to create a new tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is designed to alter the tree in place, but that can have side effects. So maybe I should approach this by creating a new mirrored tree without modifying the original.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, I create a new node with the same value, then recursively mirror the right and left subtrees, and assign them as left and right children of the new node.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each node, the mirrored node will have:\n- the same value as the original node.\n- the left child of the mirrored node is the mirror of the original's right child.\n- the right child of the mirrored node is the mirror of the original's left child.\n\nThat way, the original tree remains unchanged, and a new mirrored tree is built correctly.\n\nSo, putting this into code:\n\nWe'll recursively go through each node, create a new node, then assign left and right by swapping the processing of the original's left and right.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    # create a new node with the same value\n    new_root = TreeNode(root.val)\n    # mirror the left and right, and assign them in reverse\n    new_root.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_root.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_root\n\nWait, let's think about this. For the original root, we create a new node with the same value. Then, the new left is the mirror of the original right. Because when you mirror the right subtree, it will recursively swap its children as well. So this would effectively mirror the entire tree.\n\nTesting this with the sample given:\n\nSample 1: root is TreeNode(1). Then the mirrored_root is also a TreeNode(1) because it has no children. That's correct.\n\nSample 2: We have root with left 2 and right 3. So the mirrored_root is a new node with value 1. Its left is the mirror of the original right, which is 3. Since the original 3 node has no children, that just becomes 3. Similarly, the mirrored_root's right is the mirror of the original left, which is 2. So mirrored_root left is 3, right is 2, which matches the sample. So this seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: a tree that's deeper.\n\nRoot is 1, left has 2, whose left is 4, right has 5. Right has 3, left 6, right 7.\n\nMirrored tree should have 1's left as the mirror of the original right.\n\nOriginal right is 3, so the mirror would be:\n\n3's left becomes 3's right's mirror. So 3's right was 7, so mirror is none, same for left. So new left's right is mirror of 6, which would have left's right.\n\nWait, perhaps the function does the correct thing.\n\nIn code, when processing the original right child (3), new_root.left would be mirror_tree(3's right), which is 7: a node with value 7, no children. Then, new_root's left's right is mirror_tree(3's left). Wait, no, wait, let's see.\n\nWait for the original root, the left of the new_root is mirror_tree(original root's right), which is 3. So mirror_tree(3) would create a new node 3. Then, for the new 3's left, it's the mirror of 3's original right, which is 7. So the new 3's left is 7. Then, for the new 3's right, it's the mirror of 3's original left, which is 6. The mirror of 6 is a new 6, with left as mirror of null (which is null) and right as mirror of null.\n\nSo, putting this together, the mirrored tree of a deep tree should be correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother approach is to swap the left and right of every node in place, but that would modify the original tree. But the function's contract is to return the mirrored tree. So perhaps the function is expected not to modify the original tree. So in that case, the approach of creating new nodes is correct.\n\nHence, the code I wrote earlier should be correct. Let's write it properly.\n\nSo in code:\n\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return None\n    # Create a new node with the same value as root\n    new_root = TreeNode(root.val)\n    # Recursively mirror the right and left subtrees and assign them\n    new_root.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_root.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_root\n\nWait, but maybe the function is supposed to work with the existing nodes. Or not. The sample seems to show that at least, the original tree isn't modified, because the samples call mirror_root and then check the original's children. But wait, in the sample, it's but in mirror_tree, are we creating new nodes or reassigning the existing ones.\n\nWait, no, in any case, the function I wrote returns a new tree without modifying the original.\n\nWell, given the sample input, the function works as expected. Let's see:\n\nIn the second sample, the original nodes are 1,2,3. After mirror_tree, the new_root is 1, left is 3, right is 2, because:\n\nnew_root.left is mirror_tree(3) \u2192 3.\nnew_root.right is mirror_tree(2) \u2192 2.\n\nSo the left and right are correct.\n\nSo I think the code should work.\n\nAlternatively, what if I didn't create new nodes but just swap the children in the existing tree and return the root? Then the original tree would be modified. Which might or might not be acceptable.\n\nBut the question is, when the user calls mirror_tree, do they expect a new tree or the same tree mirrored? Looking back at the sample, the mirrored_root's left is 3 and right is 2. So the code in the sample expects that, but the original tree's left is still 2, right is 3. So the function must return a new tree without modifying the original.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of creating new nodes is correct.\n\nWait no, perhaps I've misinterpreted the sample. Let me check:\n\nThe code sample:\n\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = 2\nroot.right = 3\nmirrored_root = mirror_tree(root)\nmirrored_root.left.val \u2192 3\nmirrored_root.right.val \u2192 2\n\nIn our code, because mirrored_root is a new node with mirrored children, this is correct. If the code had just swapped the original node's children, the mirrored_root would still be the same node as root, and mirrored_root.left would be 3 and right 2. But in that case, the original root's left and right would also have been swapped. So if we print root.left, it would be 3, right would be 2. But the original question's sample doesn't show that.\n\nIn the sample given, after mirror_tree is called, the mirrored_root's children are 3 and 2, but the original root remains with 2 and 3. So in the case of in-place mirroring, the function would modify the original, but unless the function's contract allows it, it's probably not desired. But creating a new tree avoids side effects.\n\nSo to ensure that, creating a new tree is better.\n\nTherefore, the code I wrote is correct.\n\nNow, another thought: what if the tree has a long chain. For example, root has a left child, which has a left child, etc. The function should correctly flip all those nodes.\n\nI think the code would handle that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function would recursively create new nodes and assign the mirrored left and right.\n\nSo, the code is as written earlier.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that returns the mirror image of a given binary tree. The mirror image of a tree is a tree where each node's left and right children are swapped at every level.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves recursively traversing the tree and creating a new tree where each node's left and right children are swapped. This ensures that the original tree remains unchanged, and a new mirrored tree is constructed.\n\nHere are the steps involved in the approach:\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None` as there is nothing to mirror.\n2. **Recursive Case**: For each node, create a new node with the same value. Then, recursively mirror the right subtree and assign it as the left child of the new node, and recursively mirror the left subtree and assign it as the right child of the new node.\n3. **Return the New Node**: After constructing the left and right subtrees, return the new node which is the root of the mirrored tree.\n\nThis approach ensures that each subtree is mirrored correctly, and the entire tree is traversed in a post-order manner (left, right, root).\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if not root:\n        return None\n    new_root = TreeNode(root.val)\n    new_root.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_root.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_root\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Case Handling**: The function first checks if the current node is `None`. If it is, the function returns `None` as there is nothing to process.\n- **Node Creation**: For each node, a new node is created with the same value as the current node.\n- **Recursive Mirroring**: The function recursively processes the right subtree of the current node and assigns the result to the left child of the new node. Similarly, it processes the left subtree of the current node and assigns the result to the right child of the new node.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the new node, which is the root of the mirrored tree.\n\nThis method ensures that the original tree remains unchanged and a new mirrored tree is constructed efficiently. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive call stack and the storage required for the new tree.",
