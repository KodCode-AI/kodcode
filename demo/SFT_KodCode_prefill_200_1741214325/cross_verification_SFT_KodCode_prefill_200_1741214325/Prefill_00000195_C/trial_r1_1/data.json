  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called mirror_tree that takes a root node of a binary tree and returns its mirror image. Hmm, mirror image means that the left and right children of each node are swapped. So for every node, its left becomes right and right becomes left in the mirrored tree.\n\nLet me think about the example given in the problem. When the root is just a single node with value 1, mirroring it should still give the same root because there are no children to swap. That's straightforward.\n\nAnother example is when the root has left and right children. For instance, a root with 1, left child 2, and right child 3. Mirroring would make the left child 3 and the right child 2. So after the function runs, checking the left and right of the mirrored root should return 3 and 2 respectively.\n\nSo the approach should be recursive. For each node, I need to process its children by swapping them and then recursively mirror their subtrees. Wait, no, perhaps swapping first then mirroring the subtrees? Or maybe mirror the subtrees and then swap them?\n\nWait, actually, thinking deeper: When you mirror the tree, you have to flip the structure. So for each node, mirror its left and right subtrees, and then swap them. Because the subtree structure needs to be mirrored as well, not just the immediate children.\n\nWait, maybe another way. Suppose I have a node N with left L and right R. The mirrored tree of N would be a node with value N.val, left as the mirrored tree of R, and right as the mirrored tree of L. Because this way, the entire left subtree becomes the mirrored right subtree and vice versa.\n\nSo the base case: If the node is None, then return None.\n\nOtherwise, create a new node with the same value, but its left child is the mirror of the original right child, and its right child is the mirror of the original left child. Then return this new node.\n\nOh wait, but in the original function, what do we do with the existing tree? Are we supposed to create a new tree structure or modify the existing one? The function seems to return a new TreeNode, so probably we're building a new tree rather than mutating the existing one.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample code:\n\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nAfter mirror_tree(root), the mirrored_root's left is 3, right is 2.\n\nSo it's creating a new structure where the left and right are swapped, recursively.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFunction mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    new_node = TreeNode(root.val)\n    new_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_node\n\nThat should do it. Because for each node, we create a copy with the same value, and then recursively mirror the right subtree to become the left child, and the left subtree to become the right child.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample input:\n\nOriginal root has left 2, right 3.\n\nmirror_tree is called on root (1). It creates new_node 1.\n\nThen it calls mirror_tree on the right child (3), which is a leaf. So creates new node 3, left and right None.\n\nSimilarly, calls mirror_tree on the left child (2) which creates new node 2, left and right None.\n\nSo the new_node's left is 3, right is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nWhat about a deeper tree? Let's say the root has a left child which has its own children.\n\nFor example:\n\n        1\n      /   \\\n     2     3\n    / \\\n   4   5\n\nThe mirror should be:\n\n        1\n      /   \\\n     3     2\n          / \\\n         5   4\n\nWait according to the function: root is 1. So it's left is mirror_tree of right (3's subtree), which is a leaf, so it becomes new left of root. The right of new node is mirror_tree of root's left, which is:\n\nFor root's left (2), mirror it: new node 2, its left is mirror of right (5), which is 5, right is mirror of left (4), which is 4. So the mirrored 2 has left child 5 and right child 4. So now, in the overall mirrored tree, the right child of root is this new node 2 with left 5 and right 4. So the structure becomes as desired.\n\nSo the function seems correct.\n\nThus, I think the solution is to recursively create a new node where each node's left and right children are the mirrored right and left subtrees.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe need to handle the case where the root is None.\n\nOtherwise, create a new node with the same value, then recursively create left and right.\n\nWait, but wait: In the function, are we creating new TreeNode instances or reusing existing ones? Because in the samples, the mirrored_root's left is a new node with value 3, which was previously the right child. So yes, it's a new tree.\n\nSo the function is to return a new tree, a copy of the original but mirrored.\n\nThus, the function would be written as:\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    mirrored = TreeNode(root.val)\n    mirrored.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    mirrored.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return mirrored\n\nThat should do it.\n\nLet me test this with the given examples.\n\nFirst, test case 1: root is TreeNode(1). mirror_tree returns a node with value 1, no children. So correct.\n\nSecond test case: root is 1, left 2, right 3. The function creates a mirrored node with left as mirror of 3 (which returns a node with value 3). The right is mirror of 2 (returns node 2). So the mirrored root has left 3, right 2 as in the sample.\n\nLooks good.\n\nAnother test: suppose a tree where root has only a left child. Root(0) has left(1), right None. The mirrored tree should have root(0) with right(1), left None.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test: a more complex tree.\n\nIn code, it should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create the mirror image of a given binary tree. The mirror image of a tree is another tree where each node's left and right children are swapped. This transformation is applied recursively to all nodes in the tree.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves recursively traversing the tree and creating a new tree where each node's left and right children are swapped. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None` as there are no children to process.\n2. **Recursive Case**: For each node, create a new node with the same value as the current node.\n3. **Swap Children**: Recursively mirror the right subtree and assign it as the left child of the new node, and recursively mirror the left subtree and assign it as the right child of the new node.\n4. **Return the New Node**: After setting up the children, return the new node.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node's children are swapped at every level of the tree, resulting in the mirror image of the original tree.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef mirror_tree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    mirrored = TreeNode(root.val)\n    mirrored.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    mirrored.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return mirrored\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Case Handling**: The function checks if the current node (`root`) is `None`. If it is, the function returns `None` immediately.\n- **Node Creation**: For each non-`None` node, a new `TreeNode` is created with the same value as the current node.\n- **Recursive Mirroring**: The function then recursively processes the right child of the current node and assigns the result to the left child of the new node. Similarly, it processes the left child and assigns the result to the right child of the new node.\n- **Returning the Mirrored Tree**: Finally, the newly created node (with its children mirrored) is returned, building the mirrored tree from the bottom up.\n\nThis solution efficiently constructs the mirrored tree in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the original tree, as each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursion stack and the storage required for the new mirrored tree.",
