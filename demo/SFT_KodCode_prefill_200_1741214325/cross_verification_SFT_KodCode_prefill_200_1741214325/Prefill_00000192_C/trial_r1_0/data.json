  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the first repeating character in a string. Hmm, how do I approach this? Let's think.\n\nSo, the function is called first_repeating_char and it takes a string s as input. It should return the first character that repeats. If none, return -1.\n\nLet me look at the examples to understand better. For instance, in \"programming\", the first repeating char is 'r'. And in \"aabbccddeeff\", it's 'a' because it's the first one that appears more than once.\n\nSo, what defines the first repeating character? It's the first one in the string that occurs at least two times. But not just any repeated character, it has to appear again later in the string.\n\nWait, no. Because first repeating is based on when the repetition occurs. For example, if the string is \"abba\", the first 'a' repeats. But when checking each character, as I go left to right, the first one that I find has been seen before.\n\nOh right, maybe I should track the characters I've already seen so far and for each new character, check if it's already in that set. Once I find such a character, return it immediately.\n\nWait, but that's the first occurrence that is a repeat. Wait no, it might not be the first in the string to have repeated. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think: as I go through each character from left to right, for each position i, I check if the current character has appeared before in the substring s[0..i-1]. If yes, then that's the first repeating character. So the first occurrence where a duplicate is found.\n\nSo, for example, in \"abba\":\n\n- a: not seen before. Add to set.\n- b: add to set.\n- b: already in set, so this is the first repeat. Return 'b'. But wait, in the earlier example, maybe the function returns 'b' for \"abba\"? I think that's correct.\n\nWait the sample input in \"abccba\". The output is 'c'. Let me see why. The string is a b c c b a.\n\nLooking at each character:\n\na: seen = {a}\nb: seen = {a, b}\nc: seen has a and b; add c. So s[2] is c. When i is 3, the character is c, which is in seen. So return 'c'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the approach is to scan each character, keep track of the chars we've seen so far. For each character:\n\n- If it's already in seen, return it because it's the first to repeat.\n- Else, add it to the seen set.\n\nWait, but we need to make sure that the character appears more than once. But this approach would find the first occurrence that's a duplicate.\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, in \"aabbccddeeff\":\n\nThe first 'a' is added to seen. The second 'a' is already in seen, so it's returned immediately, so it returns 'a' correctly.\n\nBut in \"abba\", when we reach the third character 'b', which is already in seen, so return 'b'.\n\nWait, but in the sample input \"abba\", is 'b' the first repeating character? Let's see.\n\nThe string is 'a','b','b','a'.\n\n- a is added.\n- b is added.\n- next b: already in 'seen', so return 'b'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn \"abba\", the function should return 'b'.\n\nBut in the earlier example I made earlier, the sample \"abccba\" returns 'c' because the third 'c' is when the repeat is found.\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, this suggests that the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize an empty set called seen.\n\nLoop through each character in s from left to right:\n\n   if current_char is in seen:\n       return current_char\n   else:\n       add current_char to seen\n\nIf no such character found after the loop, return -1.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nWait, let me test this with various cases.\n\nCase 1: 'programming' -> 'r'\n\nLet's simulate:\n\np: add\nr: add\no: add\ng: add\nr: already in seen. So return 'r'.\n\nYes.\n\nCase 2: \"abcdef\" --> no repeats, return -1.\n\nYes.\n\nCase 3: \"aabbccddeeff\" --> process:\n\na is added. Next a: already exists. Return 'a'.\n\nYes.\n\nCase4: \"abccba\" --> a added, b added, c added.\n\nNext c is already present. Return 'c'.\n\nYes.\n\nCase5: \"xyz\" \u2192 no repeats, -1.\n\nCase6: empty string: return -1.\n\nCase7: \"aa\" \u2192 second a is in seen, so return 'a'.\n\nHmm, yes.\n\nBut wait, in \"abcba\", for instance:\n\ns = \"abcba\"\n\nThe characters are a, b, c, b, a.\n\nWe process a: added.\nb: added.\nc: added.\nThen b: in seen, so return 'b'.\n\nSo function would return 'b'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the first repeating occurs but later. For example, in 'abba', the function returns 'b' at position 2, which is indeed the earliest possible to find a repeating character.\n\nSo this approach looks correct.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nDefine the function, take s as input.\n\nCreate a seen set.\n\nLoop through each character in s:\n\n   for c in s:\n      if c in seen:\n          return c\n      else:\n          seen.add(c)\n\nAfter the loop ends, return -1.\n\nWait, that's exactly it.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types. The function is supposed to return a string if a repeat is found, or -1. So for the case when no repeat, returns -1.\n\nNow, test this code with the examples.\n\nYes.\n\nSo why not write the function as:\n\ndef first_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n\nWait, but wait, looking back at the sample input \"aabbccddeeff\", which is \"aabbccddeeff\". So the first repeat is 'a', which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the string s, as we go from left to right, the first occurrence of a repeated character is our answer.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return a string, or -1. So that's correct, as in the code above, it returns a string when a char is found, else -1 (which is an integer). But the examples show that it's acceptable, like the second sample returns -1.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo that's the correct code.\n\nWait, but the code as written would work in all test cases?\n\nLet me see:\n\nTesting \"aa\" returns 'a'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting \"abba\" returns 'b', as the second 'b' is found, right?\n\nWait, \"abba\": index 0 is 'a' (added), index 1 is 'b' (added), index 2 is 'b' which is in seen. So returns 'b'. But in the string, 'b' appears earlier than the second 'a', but in this code, the 'b's are next to each other. So function returns 'b' as the first repeating, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, wait. What if there's a string where a previous character is repeated later? Like 'abcda'.\n\nIn 'abcda', the first repeating is 'a'. But according to the code, as we process each character:\n\na \u2192 added.\n\nb \u2192 added.\n\nc \u2192 added.\n\nd \u2192 added.\n\na \u2192 already in seen, so return 'a'.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the code correctly returns the first occurrence of a repeated character in the string.\n\nSo now, test all given examples.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function is correctly written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first repeating character in a given string. If no character repeats, we should return -1. The solution approach involves tracking characters as we traverse the string and checking for repeats efficiently.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Set**: We use a set to keep track of characters that have been seen so far as we traverse the string from left to right.\n2. **Traverse Each Character**: For each character in the string, check if it is already present in the set.\n3. **Check for Repeats**: If a character is found in the set, it means this is the first repeating character, and we return it immediately.\n4. **Update the Set**: If a character is not found in the set, add it to the set and continue to the next character.\n5. **Return -1 if No Repeats**: If we complete the traversal without finding any repeating character, return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the first repeating character using a linear scan and set operations, which are average O(1) time complexity for insertions and lookups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef first_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty set called `seen` to keep track of characters encountered during the traversal.\n- **Traversal and Check**: For each character in the string, we check if it exists in the `seen` set. If it does, we return the character immediately as it is the first repeating character.\n- **Update Set**: If the character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and proceed.\n- **No Repeats**: If the loop completes without finding any repeating character, we return -1.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the first repeating character with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, ensuring optimal performance even for longer strings.",
