  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called first_repeating_char that takes a string and returns the first character that repeats. If none repeat, return -1. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, what's a repeating character? It's a character that appears more than once in the string. And I need to find the first one that does so. That means, as I go through the string from the start, the first character I encounter that has already been seen before.\n\nOh right, so the order matters. The first occurrence of a character, and if it appears again later, it's a candidate. But among all such possible candidates, I need the one that first had a duplicate.\n\nSo my plan is: I need to track which characters I've already seen as I iterate through the string. For each character, if I've seen it before when I'm checking it now, then that's a repeating character. But I need the first such occurrence in the string.\n\nWait, but how do I track this? Maybe I can create a dictionary or a set to keep track of characters I've encountered.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider an empty string. Well, according to the example, it should return -1. That's the easy case.\n\nFor a string like \"aa\", it should return 'a'. Because the second 'a' is a repeat of the first.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string, left to right.\n2. For each character at position i:\n   a. Check if the character has already been seen before (in the characters 0 to i-1).\n   b. If yes, return this character immediately because it's the first such occurrence.\n   c. If no, add it to the set of seen characters.\n3. If the loop finishes without finding any repeating character, return -1.\n\nWait, but how can I find the correct first repeating character? Because the first time a repetition is detected, that's the one to return.\n\nYes. So another example: \"abba\" would return 'b', because the second 'b' is the first repetition (since 'a' was seen before but only repeats at the end).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- The string \"abba\" is 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'.\n- As I go through each character:\n  1. 'a' is not in the set; add it.\n  2. 'b' is not in the set; add it.\n  3. 'b' is in the set, so return 'b' immediately.\n- So the result is 'b', which is correct.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nSo I can use a set to track the characters we have seen so far. For each character in the string in order, check if it's in the set. If it is, return it. If not, add it to the set.\n\nWait a second, no. Because that approach will return the second occurrence. Wait, let me try with an example: \"programming\".\n\nThe example shows that the first repeating character is 'r'. Let's see:\n\n\"programming\" is spelled as p-r-o-g-r-a-m-m-i-n-g.\n\nLooking at each character:\n\n1. 'p' \u2192 not seen \u2192 add.\n2. 'r' \u2192 not seen \u2192 add.\n3. 'o' \u2192 not seen \u2192 add.\n4. 'g' \u2192 not seen \u2192 add.\n5. 'r' \u2192 already in the set \u2192 so return 'r' immediately. So yes, the example is satisfied.\n\nWait, so the method would correctly return 'r' when it is found the second time.\n\nSo yes, the approach of checking each character in order, and the first one found that is in the set, is the way to go.\n\nSo the steps again:\n\nInitialize an empty set called seen.\n\nLoop through each character in the string s:\n\n   for char in s:\n\n       if char in seen:\n\n           return char\n\n       else:\n\n           add char to seen\n\nAfter the loop, if no repeats, return -1.\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nCase 1: \"abcdef\" \u2192 all unique, return -1. Correct.\n\nCase 2: \"aab\" \u2192 returns 'a'. Because the first 'a' is added, the second is checked and found, so 'a' is returned immediately.\n\nAnother case: \"abba\" \u2192 'b' is the first repeating character, as discussed earlier.\n\nAnother test case: \"abccba\" \u2192 let's see:\n\nProcess:\n\na: add\nb: add\nc: add\nThen the next character is 'c', which is in the set \u2192 return 'c'. But wait, what about the 'b' and 'a' that come after? They don't matter because the function returns as soon as it finds the first repeat.\n\nSo according to the example, it does return 'c', which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another test case: \"dadbac\".\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nd \u2192 add.\n\na \u2192 add.\n\nd \u2192 found in set, so returns 'd'? No, because in \"dadbac\":\n\nWait, the string is d, a, d, b, a, c.\n\nSo the loop:\n\n1. d: add.\n\n2. a: add.\n\n3. d: already present \u2192 return 'd'. But wait, the first repeating character is the third character 'd' which is the first occurrence of a repeated character. So the function will return 'd'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut what about the first letter that is a repeat in the entire string even if it's found later? Maybe wait, no: the function correctly returns the first time a repeat is found as we iterate through the string.\n\nThus, the algorithm should work.\n\nBut what about a case where the first character has a duplicate, but a later one comes earlier.\n\nWait for example: 'bcaba'.\n\nThe string is 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a'.\n\nSo the first repeat is 'b' at position 3, and 'a' is at position 5.\n\nBut when the algorithm processes position 3, 'b' is found in the set (as 'b' was added at position 0). So it returns 'b', which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nSo the steps to code this:\n\n- Initialize an empty set.\n\n- Iterate through each character in the input string, in order.\n\n- For each character:\n\n   if it's in the set \u2192 return it as a string.\n\n   else, add it to the set.\n\n- If all characters are processed and none are repeats \u2192 return -1.\n\nWait, but in Python, the function is supposed to return a str or -1. So what's the function's return type? According to the examples, it returns str or -1.\n\nWait, the function is annotated as returning str, but example shows returning -1 which is an integer. Hmm, perhaps the function returns a string when a character repeats, else returns -1 as an integer.\n\nBut in the examples, the function returns 'r', and -1 for another case. So how is this handled? Because in Python, I can have a function that sometimes returns a string and sometimes an integer.\n\nIn this case, the function returns a string if a repeat is found, else -1 as an integer.\n\nSo in the code, if any char is found to repeat, return char (str) else return -1 (int).\n\nSo now, coding that.\n\nWait, but the code is written as a function.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef first_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n\nWait, but in the examples, when returning -1, it's integer. So the function's return type is a union, but the problem shows that in the examples, they return -1 as integer.\n\nBut in Python, you can have a function that returns different types based on conditions.\n\nBut looking back, the problem defines that the function returns -1 if no character repeats. So perhaps the function returns either a single character string or -1.\n\nWhat about in cases where the function returns -1 for no repetition. So in the code, in case the loop completes, it returns -1.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest case 1: 'programming':\n\ncharacters are p, r, o, g, r \u2192 when processing r, it's already in the set, so return 'r' \u2192 correct.\n\nTest case 2: \"abcde\" \u2192 loop adds a, b, c, d, e \u2192 no repeats, returns -1.\n\nTest case 3: \"aabbccddeeff\" \u2192 processing each character, 'a' is added, then next 'a' is found to be in the set \u2192 returns 'a' \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"abccba\" \u2192 'a' is added, 'b', 'c' added, next 'c' is in set \u2192 returns 'c'.\n\nAnother test case: \"xyy\" \u2192 'x' is added, first 'y' added, next 'y' is in set \u2192 returns 'y'.\n\nBut wait if the string is 'xyy', would the function return 'y'? Yes. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work for all these cases.\n\nI think that's all. So the code is as written above.\n\nWait, no! Wait, in the problem example, the function is supposed to return 'c' for \"abccba\". Let me run that through the code.\n\nThe code for \"abccba\":\n\nLoop steps:\n\nchar a: not in set, add.\n\nchar b: not in set, add.\n\nchar c: not in set, add.\n\nchar c: is in set \u2192 return 'c' \u2192 which is correct as intended.\n\nYep, that works.\n\nNow, what about the case where a later character is a repetition but not the first to be found.\n\nWait, suppose the string is 'abba':\n\nprocessing 'a' \u2192 add.\n\nprocessing 'b'\u2192 add.\n\nprocessing 'b'\u2192 found in set \u2192 returns 'b', correct.\n\nWait, but what about the 'a' comes later, but that's not a problem because the duplicate is 'b', which was found as the first.\n\nSo the code correctly captures the first duplicate when it is found.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first repeating character in a given string. If no character repeats, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves iterating through the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen using a set. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty set**: This set will help us keep track of the characters we have encountered as we iterate through the string.\n2. **Iterate through each character in the string**: For each character, check if it exists in the set.\n3. **Check for repetition**: If the character is found in the set, it means this character is repeating, so we return it immediately.\n4. **Update the set**: If the character is not found in the set, add it to the set.\n5. **Handle non-repeating case**: If we complete the iteration without finding any repeating character, return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently track the first occurrence of each character and immediately identify the first repeating character as we encounter it during the iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef first_repeating_char(s: str) -> str:\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty set called `seen` which will store the characters we have processed.\n- **Iteration**: We loop through each character in the input string `s`.\n- **Check and Return**: For each character, we check if it is already in the `seen` set. If it is, we return the character immediately as it is the first repeating character.\n- **Update Set**: If the character is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the set and continue with the next character.\n- **Return -1**: If the loop completes without finding any repeating character, we return -1 indicating no character repeats.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the first repeating character with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, by using a set to track characters in constant time.",
