  "r1_response": "<think>\nI need to write a Python function to determine if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward, like 121 or 1331. \n\nFirst, I should consider how to reverse the digits of the number. One straightforward method is to convert the number into a string. Once it's a string, reversing it is easy using slicing. Then I'll compare the original string to the reversed string. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.\n\nI should outline the steps:\n1. Convert the number to a string.\n2. Reverse the string.\n3. Compare the original and reversed strings.\n4. Return True if they match, otherwise False.\n\nI also want to handle negative numbers. Since negative numbers can't be palindromes due to the minus sign, I should include a check at the beginning of the function. If the number is negative, the function will return False.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the number mathematically without converting it to a string. This involves extracting each digit and building the reversed number, then comparing it to the original. However, the string method is simpler and more efficient for this purpose.\n\nTesting some examples: \n- 121 should return True.\n- 123 should return False.\n- 1331 should return True.\n- -121 should return False.\n\nI should make sure to handle edge cases, like single-digit numbers, which are inherently palindromes. Also, numbers ending with zero (except zero itself) cannot be palindromes because the reversed number would start with zero, but in integer form, leading zeros are not allowed. However, since the function receives an integer, this isn't a problem as the integer won't have leading zeros.\n\nI think the string method is clear and concise, making the function easy to read and maintain. So I'll proceed with converting the number to a string and comparing it to its reverse.\n\nNow, let's write the function. It will take an integer as input, check if it's negative, then compare the string and its reverse. If all conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, False.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a number is a palindrome, we can convert it into a string and check if it reads the same backward as forward. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = str(x)\n    return s == s[::-1]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check for Negative Numbers:**\n   - Immediately return `False` if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.\n\n2. **Convert to String:**\n   - Convert the integer to its string representation to easily manipulate and reverse the digits.\n\n3. **Reverse and Compare:**\n   - Reverse the string using slicing `s[::-1]`.\n   - Compare the original string `s` with the reversed string. If they are identical, the number is a palindrome.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- **Positive Palindrome:** `is_palindrome(121)` returns `True`.\n- **Negative Number:** `is_palindrome(-121)` returns `False`.\n- **Non-Palindrome:** `is_palindrome(123)` returns `False`.\n- **Single-Digit Palindrome:** `is_palindrome(5)` returns `True`.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages string manipulation to check for palindrome properties, making it both concise and easy to understand.",
