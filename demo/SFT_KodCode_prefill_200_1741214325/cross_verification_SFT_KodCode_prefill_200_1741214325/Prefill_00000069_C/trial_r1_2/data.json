  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called count_trailing_zeros that takes an integer as input and returns the number of trailing zeros it has. Hmm, trailing zeros are the zeros at the end of the number, right? Like 100 has two, 0 has one, and 123 has none.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, the simplest way is to check each digit from the end of the number until we hit a non-zero digit. Each time the last digit is zero, we increment a counter and then remove that zero.\n\nWait, but how do I do that in Python? Let me think. Using a loop, maybe a while loop, since we don't know how many zeros there are.\n\nWait, the steps should be:\n\n1. If the number is zero, return 1 because it's just a single zero.\n2. Otherwise, initialize a counter to zero.\n3. While the number is divisible by 10 (i.e., number % 10 == 0), do two things:\n   a. Increment the counter.\n   b. Divide the number by 10 to remove the last digit (which is zero).\n4. Once the loop ends, return the counter.\n\nWait, but what about when the number is zero? Because in the loop, it would immediately be handled. So maybe I can include a check before the loop. Because if the number is zero, the loop might not execute correctly.\n\nWait, no. If number is zero, the initial value is zero, then number %10 is zero, but then after dividing, it's still zero. So it would go into an infinite loop.\n\nSo I need to handle the number zero as a special case. So in the function:\n\n- If the number is zero, return 1.\n- Else, proceed with the loop.\n\nBecause if I don't, the loop would keep dividing zero by 10 forever. So that's an important edge case.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nFunction definition:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(number: int) -> int:\n\nThen, inside, first check if number is zero:\nif number == 0:\n    return 1\n\nThen initialize count to zero:\ncount = 0\n\nThen, loop while number %10 == 0:\n\nWait, wait. Let's see an example. Take 100.\n\ncount is 0. 100 %10 is zero, so count becomes 1. Then number is 10 (100//10=10).\n\nAgain, 10%10=0, count 2. Number becomes 1.\n\nNow, 1%10 is 1 !=0. So loop ends. Return 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 0. So the function returns 1, correct.\n\nAnother example: 1230. Trailing zeros are one. Let's see:\n\nnumber is 1230. 1230%10=0, count 1. Then number becomes 123.\n\n123%10 is 3 !=0, so loop stops. Count is 1.\n\nAnother example: 000. Wait, in Python, 000 is treated as 0, so the function would return 1.\n\nNow, what about numbers with more zeros, like 50000. The loop would run 4 times, count 4, and stop.\n\nBut what about when the number is negative? Like -100. The trailing zeros are still two, right? Because the negative sign doesn't affect the digits in the number.\n\nSo the code handles negative numbers correctly, because in Python, the modulo of a negative number can be positive. For example, -100 %10 is 0. So as long as the last digit is zero, it will count.\n\nSo I think this covers all cases.\n\nAnother test case: number=10. Should return 1.\n\nWhat about number = 1? Then the loop doesn't run, returns zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(number: int) -> int:\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1\n    count = 0\n    while number % 10 == 0:\n        count +=1\n        number = number //10\n    return count\n\nWait, let me test more cases.\n\nCase: number=0 \u2192 returns 1.\n\nnumber=5 \u2192 number is 5, 5%10=5, loop doesn't run \u2192 returns 0.\n\nnumber=10 \u2192 count is 1.\n\nnumber=100 \u2192 2.\n\nnumber=123 \u2192 0.\n\nnumber= -100 \u2192 2.\n\nnumber= -0 \u2192 wait, but in Python, -0 is treated as 0, so it should return 1.\n\nWait, but in Python, 0 and -0 are the same when treated as integers. Because -0 in Python is 0. So if someone passes -0, it's just zero. So the code handles it correctly.\n\nWhat about numbers that have multiple zeros but other digits in between? Like 1005. Then the trailing zeros is only 1, right? Because number is 1005. 1005 mod10 is 5 !=0, so count is zero. So function returns 0? Wait, wait! Wait, 1005 ends with 5, so trailing zeros are zero.\n\nYes. So in 1005, the trailing zeros are 0. So the function is correct.\n\nAnother example: number=10100 \u2192 ends with two zeros.\n\nSo, 10100 in the code. Let's see:\n\nnumber is 10100.\n\n10100%10==0 \u2192 count 1. Number becomes 1010.\n\nAgain, 1010%10==0 \u2192 count 2, number is 101.\n\n101%10 is 1 \u2192 loop ends. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWait another thing: what if number is divisible by higher powers of 10 but the end digits have non-zero. Like 10000000007, but that's just one trailing zero. But actually, no. It has 8 trailing zeros and a 7 at the end. Wait no, 10000000007 has 8 zeros before the 7, so trailing zeros are zero because the last digit is 7.\n\nYes. So our code works for that.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of trailing zeros in a given integer. Trailing zeros are the zeros that appear at the end of the number. For example, the number 100 has two trailing zeros, while the number 123 has none. The special case where the number is zero should return 1 as it has one trailing zero.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If the input number is zero, return 1 immediately since zero has exactly one trailing zero.\n2. **Loop and Count**: For non-zero numbers, initialize a counter to zero. Use a loop to repeatedly check the last digit of the number. If the last digit is zero, increment the counter and remove the last digit by dividing the number by 10. Continue this process until the last digit is not zero.\n3. **Return the Counter**: Once the loop exits, return the counter which holds the number of trailing zeros.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the trailing zeros by using modulo and division operations, which are computationally inexpensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(number: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts and returns the number of trailing zeros in the given integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if number == 0:\n        return 1  # Special case where the number itself is 0\n    count = 0\n    while number % 10 == 0:\n        count += 1\n        number //= 10\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input number is zero. If it is, the function returns 1 because zero is considered to have exactly one trailing zero.\n2. **Loop and Count**: For non-zero numbers, the function initializes a counter to zero. It then uses a while loop to repeatedly check if the last digit of the number is zero. Each time the last digit is zero, the counter is incremented, and the number is divided by 10 to remove the last digit. This process continues until the last digit is non-zero.\n3. **Return the Counter**: After the loop exits, the function returns the counter, which now holds the number of trailing zeros in the input number.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles both positive and negative integers, as well as the special case of zero, ensuring correct results for all possible integer inputs.",
