  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to write a Python function that converts a binary tree into its mirror. Hmm, okay, let's think about what mirroring a binary tree means. So, mirroring a tree would involve swapping the left and right children of each node. That makes sense because the mirror image would flip the structure around a vertical axis.\n\nFirst, I should consider how to approach this problem recursively. Because binary trees are naturally recursive structures. So, the idea is to traverse the tree, and for each node, swap its left and right subtrees. If a node doesn't have a left or right child, swapping would just leave it as is.\n\nWait, but recursion might not be the only way. Maybe I can do it iteratively as well, perhaps using a queue or stack. Let me think which approach is simpler. For trees, recursion often leads to cleaner and more intuitive code, especially since each subtree can be mirrored independently.\n\nSo, the recursive approach would involve checking if the current node is None. If it is, we just return None. If the node isn't None, we need to process its left and right subtrees and then swap them.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the correct approach is to create a mirror of a node by creating a new node with the same value, then assigning the mirror of the right subtree as the left child, and the mirror of the left subtree as the right child. Alternatively, if we're modifying the tree in place, we can swap the left and right children.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the original tree should be modified or a new mirrored tree should be created. The problem statement says the function takes the root of the binary tree, but doesn't specify whether to create a new tree or modify the existing one. I think it's safer to create a new mirrored tree rather than modifying the existing structure.\n\nWait, but in most cases, the mirror function would likely be expected to create a new tree and not alter the original. Alternatively, if we are allowed to modify the tree in place, that's another approach, but perhaps for simplicity, especially if the function is supposed to take a single parameter and return its mirror, perhaps it's better to create a new tree.\n\nWait, actually, let's read the problem again: \"The function should take a single parameter, which is the root of the binary tree.\" So I think it's better to create a new tree which is the mirror of the original. So we'd return the root of the new mirrored tree.\n\nSo, for the base case, if the root is None, we return None. Otherwise, we create a new node with the same value. Then recursively compute the mirror of the left and right subtrees and assign them appropriately. Wait, no: in the mirror, the left subtree of the new node should be the mirror of the original right subtree, and the right subtree should be the mirror of the original left subtree.\n\nLet me visualize this. Let's say I have a tree:\n\n    1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n / \\\n4   5\n\nThe mirror should be:\n\n    1\n   / \\\n  3   2\n     / \\\n    5   4\n\nSo for each node, the left and right children are swapped in the mirror. So for the root node 1, its left child 2 is swapped with its right child 3 in the mirror. Similarly, for node 2, its left child 4 is swapped with its right child 5, resulting in node 2's right becoming 5 and left becoming 4. Wait no, actually, in the example, the mirror of 2's subtree would put 5 on the left and 4 on the right, but in the example above, 2 is the left child of the root, so the mirror will place 3 as the left child of the mirror root, but that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think about each node's left and right children. So for each node in the original tree, in the mirrored tree, the left child becomes the right child, and the right child becomes the left child.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, in the mirror image, every node's left and right children are swapped. So the way to mirror the tree is to create a new node for each existing node and then assign the mirror of the original right subtree as the new node's left child, and the mirror of the original left subtree as the new node's right child.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFunction mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    new_node = Node with value root.value\n    new_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_node\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each node, the mirror would have its left child as the mirror of the original right subtree, and the right child as the mirror of the original left.\n\nSo this way, each recursive call handles a subtree. Let me test this logic with a simple example.\n\nConsider a tree with just root 1, left child 2, right child 3.\n\nAfter mirroring, the tree should have root 1, left 3, right 2.\n\nUsing the function:\n\nmirror_tree(1)\nnew_node: 1\nnew_node.left = mirror_tree(3) \u2192 returns new node 3, with no children.\nnew_node.right = mirror_tree(2) \u2192 returns new node 2, with no children.\nSo the mirrored tree is as expected.\n\nAnother example: node 2 has children 4 and 5. The function would create a new node 2 with left child as mirror of 5 (so a new node 5), and right child as mirror of 4 (new node 4). So in the mirrored subtree, 2 would have 5 as left and 4 as right.\n\nWait, but in the main tree's root case, after swapping, the root's left and right are swapped. So the function correctly builds the mirrored structure.\n\nI think this approach works.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, we need to implement a Binary Tree node class. Let's assume that the nodes have 'value', 'left', and 'right' attributes.\n\nSo first, I'll define a Node class:\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\nThen, the function mirror_tree takes the root as input and returns the root of the mirrored tree.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to return None when the node is None, and create a new node with the same value, then assign the mirrors of the right and left as left and right.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    # Create a new node with the same value\n    new_node = Node(root.value)\n    # Recursively mirror the left and right subtrees\n    new_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_node\n\nWait, let's test if this logic is correct.\n\nTake the simple case: root is 1, left is 2, right is 3.\n\nmirror_tree(1):\n\nnew_node = a new Node(1)\n\nnew_node.left = mirror_tree(1's right, which is 3). So call mirror_tree(3), which is None, so new_node.left becomes a new Node(3), which has left and right children as None.\n\nWait, no: wait, when mirror_tree is called on 3:\n\nroot is 3, which is not None.\n\nSo new_node = Node(3), then new_node.left = mirror_tree(3's right, which is None) \u2192 returns None.\n\nnew_node.right = mirror_tree(3's left, which is None) \u2192 returns None.\n\nSo new_node (3) has left and right as None.\n\nSo function returns this new_node (3).\n\nSo in the root's left is 3.\n\nThen, new_node.right = mirror_tree(1's left, which is 2). So mirror_tree(2):\n\nCreate new_node 2.\n\nnew_node.left = mirror_tree(2's right). If 2 has no right, returns None.\n\nnew_node.right = mirror_tree(2's left). Similarly returns None.\n\nSo new_node 2 is created, with left and right None.\n\nSo 1's right becomes 2.\n\nSo the mirrored tree's root's left is 3 and right is 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo this logic works for a simple two-level tree.\n\nAnother example: more levels. Suppose we have a tree like:\n\n        1\n      /   \\\n     2     3\n    / \\   / \\\n   4   5 6   7\n\nIts mirror would be:\n\n        1\n      /   \\\n     3     2\n    / \\   / \\\n   7   6 5   4\n\nSo applying the function:\n\nmirror_tree(1) creates a new node 1.\n\n1's left should be mirror of its right which is 3. So mirror_tree(3):\n\ncreates 3, with left as mirror of 3's right (7) and right as mirror of 3's left (6). So 3's left is mirror_tree(7) which is 7, no children. 3's right is mirror_tree(6) which is 6, no children. So 3's subtree is 3 with left 7 and right 6.\n\n1's right is mirror of its left which is 2. So mirror_tree(2):\n\n2 is a new node, left = mirror_tree(2's right=5), right = mirror_tree(2's left=4).\n\nmirror_tree(5) returns new 5 with left and right None.\n\nmirror_tree(4) returns new 4 with left and right None.\n\nSo 2's left is 5, right is 4. So when put under 1's right, the structure is as expected.\n\nSo the function correctly mirrors the entire tree.\n\nTherefore, this approach seems correct.\n\nI think that's the solution. So the code will involve defining the Node class and then implementing the mirror_tree function recursively.\n\nAnother thought: Since in Python, objects are mutable, but in this case, we're creating a new tree, so the original tree remains unchanged. That's good.\n\nSo the final code would be implementing this approach.\n\nWait, but the function needs to return the root of the mirrored tree, so the code would look like this.\n\nBut wait: What if the tree is empty (root is None)? The function returns None, which is correct.\n\nLet me write the code.\n\nBut perhaps I should include the Node class inside the function or as a global. Alternatively, the function could use whatever node structure is passed to it.\n\nWait, the function is supposed to be called with the root of the binary tree, so it's possible that the root is an instance of a Node class, as defined. So in the code, the function mirror_tree would have to create new Node instances.\n\nBut perhaps in a real-world scenario, the tree might be using a different class or structure. But for the problem's sake, defining the Node as above is acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    new_node = Node(root.value)\n    new_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_node\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nLet me test with the sample tree:\n\nSample tree:\n\n    1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n\nMirrored tree should be:\n\n    1\n   / \\\n  3   2\n\nWhich the function should create.\n\nOk, that seems correct.\n\nI think this covers the approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts a given binary tree into its mirror image. The mirror image of a tree is obtained by swapping the left and right children of each node at every level of the tree. This problem can be efficiently solved using a recursive approach.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to create the mirror image of a binary tree involves recursively traversing the tree and constructing a new tree where each node's left child is replaced with the mirror of the original node's right subtree, and the right child is replaced with the mirror of the original node's left subtree.\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None` as there are no more subtrees to process.\n2. **Recursive Case**: For each node, create a new node with the same value as the current node. Then recursively compute the mirror of the right subtree and assign it as the left child of the new node. Similarly, recursively compute the mirror of the left subtree and assign it as the right child of the new node.\n3. **Return the Root**: The function returns the root of the new mirrored tree.\n\nThis approach ensures that each subtree is mirrored correctly, and the entire tree is traversed and mirrored efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef mirror_tree(root):\n    if root is None:\n        return None\n    new_node = Node(root.value)\n    new_node.left = mirror_tree(root.right)\n    new_node.right = mirror_tree(root.left)\n    return new_node\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Node Class**: This class defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, with attributes for value, left child, and right child.\n- **mirror_tree Function**:\n  - **Base Case**: If the input root is `None`, the function returns `None`.\n  - **Recursive Case**: For a non-null root, a new node is created with the same value as the root. The function then recursively processes the right and left subtrees to build the mirrored structure. The mirrored right subtree becomes the left child of the new node, and the mirrored left subtree becomes the right child of the new node.\n  - **Return**: The function returns the root of the newly constructed mirrored tree.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node and its subtrees are processed correctly, leading to the creation of the mirror image of the original binary tree. The recursive solution efficiently handles each node and its children, ensuring that the entire tree is mirrored accurately.",
