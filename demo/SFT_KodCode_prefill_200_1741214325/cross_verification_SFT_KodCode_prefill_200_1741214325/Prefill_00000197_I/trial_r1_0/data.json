  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. Hmm, wait, Fibonacci sequence... right, it starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Or sometimes it starts with 1 and 1, depending on the definition. I should clarify that.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify whether n starts at 0 or 1. Oh, well, maybe the function can be general. But I think in the context of recursion, it's common to have the nth Fibonacci number where n is the position. Let me think about how the recursion works.\n\nThe base cases for Fibonacci recursion are when n is 0 or 1. Usually, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, etc. But sometimes people index starting at 1, so F(1)=0, F(2)=1. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that n starts at 0.\n\nBut wait, to keep it simple, perhaps n refers to the position in the sequence where F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc. So, for the function, I need to handle these base cases.\n\nSo the recursive approach would be: if n is 0, return 0; if n is 1, return 1; else, return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2). That makes sense.\n\nWait, but is that efficient? Because recursion can get slow for large n since it recalculates the same values many times. But the problem specifically says to use recursion, so efficiency isn't a concern here.\n\nSo I'll define the function as def fibonacci(n): and then check for base cases. Let me outline it.\n\nIf n is 0, return 0.\nIf n is 1, return 1.\nElse, return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2).\n\nBut wait, maybe I should handle n less than 0? Probably not, since the function expects a positive integer n. So I can assume n is a non-negative integer.\n\nTesting the function with small values: Let's see, fibonacci(0) should return 0, fibonacci(1) returns 1, fibonacci(2) is 1, fibonacci(3) is 2, fibonacci(4) is 3, etc. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nWait, but Python has a maximum recursion depth, so for large n, say n=1000, this function would hit a recursion error because it calls itself too many times. However, since the question is about writing a recursive function, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could we implement it with memoization to speed it up? Probably, but the problem didn't specify that, so maybe just the simple recursive version is enough.\n\nI think that's the function. Let me double-check.\n\nIf I call fibonacci(5), it should compute:\n\nfibonacci(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)\nfib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)\nfib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)\nfib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\nfib(1) =1\nSo fib(2)=1, fib(3)=1+1=2, fib(4)=2+1=3, fib(5)=3+2=5. Yes, correct.\n\nSo the function should handle that correctly. Alright, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\n### Approach\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n- F(0) = 0\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1\n\nThe approach involves using recursion to compute the nth Fibonacci number. The function will handle base cases where n is 0 or 1 directly, returning 0 and 1 respectively. For other values of n, the function will recursively call itself to compute the Fibonacci number using the relation fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The function checks if n is 0 or 1 and returns 0 or 1 immediately. These are the simplest cases and form the foundation of the recursion.\n- **Recursive Case**: For values of n greater than 1, the function calls itself twice, once with the argument n-1 and once with n-2. The results of these recursive calls are summed to compute the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThis approach leverages the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base cases. While this method is straightforward and easy to understand, it is important to note that it is not the most efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers for large values of n due to the repeated computation involved. However, it satisfies the requirement of using a recursive approach.",
