  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to find the maximum product of a triplet in an array that can have both positive and negative numbers. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the goal is to consider all possible triplets and find the one with the highest product. But wait, checking every triplet would be inefficient, especially if the array is large. Instead, I should find a smarter way without checking all combinations.\n\nI remember that for maximum product of triplets, there are a few cases to consider. The maximum product could either come from the three largest positive numbers or from the two smallest (most negative) numbers multiplied by the largest positive number. Because when you multiply two negatives, you get a positive which could result in a larger product if multiplied by another positive.\n\nSo, maybe I can sort the array first. That way, I can easily access the largest and smallest elements.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Consider two possibilities:\n   a. The product of the three largest numbers.\n   b. The product of the two smallest numbers (which could be negative) and the largest number.\n3. Compare these two products and return the maximum.\n\nWait, but are there other possibilities? What if there's a situation where the two smallest are negative, but the next largest after the two smallest are also negatives, and maybe with a positive in between? I think the initial idea covers those cases.\n\nFor example, in an array like [-5, -4, 3, 4, 5], the maximum product is either 3*4*5 = 60 or (-5)*(-4)*5 = 100. So, in that case, the maximum is 100, which is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: [-10, -9, 1, 2, 3]. The two products would be 1*2*3=6 and (-10)*(-9)*3=270, so 270 is larger.\n\nWhat about a case where there are more than three numbers, including both positives and negatives? Let's take [-100, -99, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Here, the two cases give 2*3*4=24 and (-100)*(-99)*4=39600. So the second case is larger.\n\nBut wait, there might be another case where the two most negative and third most negative, but that's only if the array has three negatives that are the largest, but then compared to the three largest positives. Wait, though, if all three largest are negatives, the maximum would be their product, but in that case, the largest in magnitude (like, most negative) would give the smallest product. So, in such cases, the two smallest negatives multiplied by the largest positive would still be better if that gives a positive.\n\nWait, wait. Let's take an array where all numbers are negative. Suppose [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]. The maximum triplet would be -3 * -2 * -1 = -6, but if I choose the two smallest (most negative) and the largest (least negative), that would be -5 * -4 * -1 = -20, which is worse. So in that case, the maximum product would actually come from the three largest negatives (-3, -2, -1), giving -6, because all products are negative. But wait, actually, in such a case, the maximum product is the one with the least negative value, which comes from the three largest (closest to zero) elements. So, for all negatives, it's sufficient to pick the three largest.\n\nBut in my initial approach, the two products considered are: option1 (product of last three, which are the three largest) and option2 (product of the two first (smallest) and the last). So in this case, when all are negative, calculating both options would cover the necessary scenarios.\n\nWait, but when the array is all negative, for example, let's say the array is size 5, sorted as [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6]. The maximum triplet would be -8 * -7 * -6 = -336. But wait, that's actually the most negative. But the maximum product in this case (all negatives) would be the three least negative numbers, which is the last three, giving the product as -336. Alternatively, considering the two smallest (most negative) and largest (least negative), that's (-10)*(-9)*(-6) = -540, which is worse. So, in this case, the maximum product is indeed -336, which comes from the last three.\n\nBut hold on, in this case, option1 is (-6)*(-7)*(-8) = -336, and option2 is (-10)*(-9)*(-6) = -540. So, option1 is better. So my approach, which takes the maximum of these two, would correctly choose option1.\n\nSimilarly, if there are more than three elements, some positive and some negative, the approach covers both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, what about when the array has four elements: [ -10, -5, 2, 3 ]. The possible triplets are:\n\n- (-10, -5, 2): product is 100\n- (-10, -5, 3): 150\n- (-10, 2,3 ): -60\n- (-5,2,3 ): -30\n\nSo the maximum is 150. Now, according to the approach:\n\noption1 is 2*3*(-5) ? No, wait, wait.\n\nWait no. After sorting, the array is [ -10, -5, 2,3 ].\n\nSo the three largest numbers are -5, 2,3. Their product is (-5)*2*3 = -30.\n\nThe two smallest are -10 and -5, multiplied by the largest,3: (-10)*(-5)*3=150.\n\nSo between -30 and 150, the maximum is 150. So correct.\n\nWhat about another case where the third element is also a possibility. For example, the array [ -10, 2, 3,4,5 ].\n\nOption1 is 3*4*5=60.\n\nOption2 is (-10)*2*5= -100.\n\nSo the maximum is 60. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about an array where the maximum product comes from two negatives and a positive that's not the largest. Hmm, would my approach capture that? For example, [ -100, -99, 1, 50, 60 ].\n\nOption1 is 1*50*60=3000.\n\nOption2 is (-100)*(-99)*60= 594000.\n\nWait, no that's way bigger. So, then my approach captures that.\n\nBut if, instead, the array was [ -100, -99, 1, 2,3 ], then option2 gives (-100)*(-99)*3=29700, which is larger than 1*2*3=6. So in that case, the correct maximum is achieved.\n\nWait, but what about an array where the best triplet is the two smallest negatives and the second largest positive? For instance, [ -100, -99, 3, 4, 5 ].\n\nHere, option1 is 3*4*5=60.\n\nOption2 is (-100)*(-99)*5=49500.\n\nSo the maximum is 49500, which my function would correctly select.\n\nBut what if the array was [ -10, -9, 1, 2, 3 ], then the two options are 1*2*3=6 vs (-10)*(-9)*3=270 \u2192 270 is larger.\n\nSo, I think the approach works.\n\nWhat about an array where the largest product comes from the third, fourth and fifth elements? Wait, since they are sorted, this approach considers the three largest, which would be the last three. So if the maximum is there, it's covered.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4,5,6]. The maximum is 4*5*6=120. Option1 would give that, and option2 would give 1*2*6=12, so the correct answer is chosen.\n\nWhat if the array has zero? Let's see. For example, [ -5, -4, 0, 3, 4 ].\n\nOption1: 0*3*4=0.\n\nOption2: (-5)*(-4)*4=80. So maximum is 80. So function works.\n\nBut wait, another case with three zeros: [0,0,0,0]. The maximum is 0.\n\nBut if the array has other numbers: [ -10, 0, 0, 5 ].\n\nOption1: 0*0*5=0.\n\nOption2: (-10)*0*5=0.\n\nSo maximum is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps also, if the array has two negatives and one zero, but three elements. So for example, [-5, -4, 0].\n\nProduct1: -5*-4*0=0.\n\nBut perhaps, the maximum is 0.\n\nYes, so the function would find that.\n\nWait, but maybe there are cases where there are four elements, and after two negatives and one positive, but to choose a higher triplet. Hmm, perhaps I should think about covering all possible cases where the maximum product can be achieved.\n\nWait, in some cases, maybe we need to also consider the product of the first three numbers, especially if all numbers are negative. Because in such case, the maximum triplet product is the three numbers closest to zero, which are the three largest (since all are negative). So, perhaps, another consideration is the product of the first three?\n\nWait, no. When the array is sorted, the first three are the smallest, which in negatives are the most negative\u2014so their product would be the most negative. But when all elements are negative, the product of the three largest is the least negative (i.e., maximum). So for example, [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1]: the maximum product is (-1)*(-2)*(-3) = -6, which is the maximum. The product of the first three is (-5)*(-4)*(-3)=-60, which is the minimum. So, no need to consider the first three in this case.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, are there cases where perhaps considering more combinations is necessary? For example, could the maximum product be from (second smallest, third smallest, something else), but maybe if array is like [ -100, -99, 1, 2, 3, x ].\n\nWait, x could be a very large positive, then (-100)*(-99)*x is huge.\n\nBut if x is negative, then x would be before 1, so in the sorted array it's placed before. Hmm, I think the approach still holds because when x is negative, the largest product would come from either the three largest (which would now include x perhaps if x is in the last elements), but I think it's getting complicated.\n\nWait, another scenario: in the array [ -10, 2, 3, 4 ].\n\nOption1: 2*3*4=24.\n\nOption2: (-10)*2*4= -80, which is worse. So, 24 is correct.\n\nAnother case: [ -10, 1, 2, 3, 4 ].\n\nOption1: 2*3*4=24.\n\nOption2: (-10)*1*4= -40.\n\nBut another triplet is 2*3*4=24, which is the max.\n\nBut wait, is there a case where the product of the four largest (except for one) gives a larger product? For example, [a, b, c, d], all positive except the first two.\n\nWait, in such a case, the three largest would give the maximum.\n\nAnother case: What about when we have four numbers, with two negatives and two positives, and choosing the maximum from both options.\n\nWait, perhaps all this is covered when considering the two options.\n\nTherefore, the approach seems solid.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute two possible products:\n\n   a. product1: the product of the last three elements (the three largest).\n\n   b. product2: the product of the first two elements (could be negative, so multiplying two negatives makes positive) and the last element.\n\n3. Return the maximum between product1 and product2.\n\nWait, but in some cases, what about the product of the first three elements? Or the product of the first two and the third or something else?\n\nWait, for example, in a sorted array [a, b, c, d, e], suppose a and b are negative, c, d, e are positive.\n\nBut the product of a, b, c is a*b*c: since a and b are negative, their product is positive, multiplied by c is positive. But is this a candidate for maximum?\n\nWell, for example, array: [-100, -99, 1, 2, 3]. The maximum is between (1*2*3)=6 and (-100)*(-99)*3=29700. But also, another product is (-100)*(-99)*1=9900, and (-100)*(-99)*2=19800. So, all these are candidates, but since 29700 is the biggest, it is chosen.\n\nBut in another case, maybe the product of a,b,d is higher. Like in [ -100, -99, 2, 3, 4 ], perhaps (-100)*(-99)*4 is the maximum, which is 39600.\n\nWait, regardless, since my approach takes the maximum between product1 (which is 2*3*4=24) and product2 (which is (-100)*(-99)*4=39600). So the function would find the maximum correctly.\n\nWait, but in some arrays, perhaps the maximum product is not covered by these two options.\n\nWait, let me take an example where the maximum is the product of a, c, d.\n\nFor example, consider the array [ -10, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]. Option1 is 3*4*5=60, option2 is (-10)*2 *5 = -100. So, the maximum is 60. But the product of (-10), 4,5 is (-10)*4*5 = -200, which is worse than 3*4*5.\n\nAnother example: [ -10, -9, 1, 3,4 ].\n\nOption1: 1*3*4=12.\n\nOption2: (-10)*(-9)*4=360. Which is higher. So correct.\n\nWhat about [ -10, -9, 2, 3,4 ].\n\nOption1: 2*3*4=24.\n\nOption2: (-10)*(-9)*4=360. So correct.\n\nAnother scenario: [ -100, -1, 2, 3,4 ].\n\nOption1: 2*3*4=24.\n\nOption2: (-100)*(-1)*4=400. So maximum is 400, which is correct.\n\nHmm, but wait. What if the maximum is achieved by a triplet that includes the first element, third element, and the last element. Like in [ -100, -99, 2, 3, 4]. The product of (-100), 2,4 is (-100)*2*4 = -800, which is worse than both options.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe if 2 is a larger number.\n\nWait, more importantly, perhaps in some cases, the product of the first element, the last element, and the third last element could be larger. For example, if the array has [ -100, 1,2,3,4,5], so the triplet could be -100, 5, and... Wait, wait. No, because when you take the last three, 3,4,5, which gives 60. The triplet of -100, 1,2 is (-100)*1*2=-200. Or -100, 4,5 is -2000, which is worse. But the product of the first two (-100,1) and last (5) gives -500. Still, none of these would be larger than 3*4*5=60. So no problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps in all cases, the maximum product is either the product of the three largest numbers or the product of the two smallest (most negative) numbers and the largest number.\n\nI think so, based on the examples I considered. Therefore, my approach should work.\n\nBut just to make sure, I need to think about the case when the maximum product comes from more than two options. For example, what if the maximum product is also achieved by the product of the two smallest and the third last element? Or perhaps, what if the maximum is somewhere in the middle.\n\nLet me take an array [ -100, -99, -5, 1, 2, 3, 4 ].\n\nIn this case, option1: 2*3*4=24.\n\noption2: (-100)*(-99)*4= 39,600.\n\nBut other triplets include (-100, -99, -5): their product is -50, (since (-100)*(-99)=9900, times (-5) is -49,500\u2014a negative number, not useful.\n\nAnother triplet is (-100, -99,4), which is 39,600, which is already covered in option2.\n\nWait, another possibility: the triplet (-100, -5,4). So, (-100)*(-5)*4= 2,000, which is less than 39,600.\n\nSo, in this case, the maximum is option2.\n\nWhat about an array where the maximum is from the first three elements?\n\nWait, in that case, it's possible only if all elements are positive, but since the first three are the smallest, then their product is smaller than the last three's. So no.\n\nWait, if all elements are negative, then the last three elements in the sorted array are the largest (closest to zero), and their product is the maximum (although still negative). The first two are the most negative, so their product multiplied by the last element (which is the largest, i.e., closest to zero) would be a more negative product compared to the product of the last three.\n\nWait, so for an array of all negatives, option1 is last three, which gives the maximum (as discussed earlier).\n\nI think I've thought through multiple scenarios, and the approach works.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute candidate1 as product of last three elements.\n\n- Compute candidate2 as product of first two and last element.\n\n- Compare candidate1 and candidate2, return the maximum.\n\nBut wait, why not consider the first three elements? Let's try:\n\nIf the array is [a,b,c,d,e], sorted. So for the first three, a<=b<=c<=d<=e.\n\nSo the product is a*b*c. But in most cases, except when all are negative, a*b*c would be less than e*d*c (since a is the smallest, etc.), but in negative cases, as discussed, we need to compare with two-negative option.\n\nWait, in an array like [ -10, -9, -1, 2, 3 ]. The product of the first three is (-10)*(-9)*(-1) = -90. The product of the last three is (-1)*2*3=-6. The product of the first two and the last is (-10)*(-9)*3=270. So, in this case, the maximum is 270, which my approach captures.\n\nSo including the product of the first two and the last is sufficient.\n\nWait, another case where perhaps the maximum is the product of the first three and something else: For example, the maximum could be the product of the first three. But that's only if all the last two are negative, making the last triplet a more negative product. But when the array has a mix of positive and negative numbers, the maximum is either the last three, or the first two and last one.\n\nTherefore, considering only these two cases is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the steps for the function are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute product of the last three elements.\n\n3. Compute product of the first two and last element.\n\n4. Compute the maximum between these two products.\n\nWait, but wait: in the examples given, option2 is the product of the first two and the last. But what if there's a case where the two smallest and the second last gives a higher product?\n\nLike, in [ -10, -9, 1, 3,4,5,6 ]. So the last element is 6, the second last is 5. So option2 is (-10)*(-9)*6=540.\n\nWhat about the product of (-10)*(-9)*5=450, which is less than 540.\n\nThus, considering the last element is sufficient because, given the array is sorted, the last element is the largest, giving the highest product when multiplied by two negatives.\n\nWait, but in another case, if the largest element is x, and second largest is y, which is less than x. So any triplet involving two negatives and a positive that's larger than x would not exist, because x is the largest.\n\nThus, the maximum product of two negatives and a positive is achieved when the positive is the largest (x).\n\nThus, my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, what if the second last element is positive and higher than the last when combined with the two first elements.\n\nWait, for example, array [ -100, -99, 3,4,5,6,7 ].\n\nThe maximum in option2 is (-100)*(-99)*7= 69300.\n\nWhich is higher than any other triplet including the two first and any other positive.\n\nSo, it's correct.\n\nSo, the function can be written as follows:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the product of the last three as candidate1.\n\n- Compute the product of the first two and the last element as candidate2.\n\n- The maximum product is the maximum of candidate1 and candidate2.\n\nWait, but for an array with exactly three elements, both candidates will give the same result, which is the product of all three, so no problem.\n\nAnother test: array of four elements [ a, b, c, d ].\n\nCompute:\n\ncandidate1: b*c*d.\n\ncandidate2: a*b*d.\n\nWait, but wait, what if a is negative and b is also negative? Then candidate2 could be larger if candidate1 is also a product that might be negative.\n\nWait, for example, array [ -5, -4, 3, 4 ].\n\ncandidate1 is (-4)*3*4= -48.\n\ncandidate2 is (-5)*(-4)*4=80.\n\nSo the function would return 80.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but in code, when the array is sorted, it's [ -5, -4, 3,4 ].\n\nSo the indices are 0: -5, 1:-4, 2:3, 3:4.\n\nSo candidate1 is array[1]*array[2]*array[3]= (-4)*3*4=-48.\n\nCandidate2 is array[0]*array[1]*array[3]= (-5)*(-4)*4=80.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, to find the candidates.\n\nBut first, sort the array.\n\nBut if the array has less than three elements, then it's not a valid input since we need a triplet. So the function can perhaps handle that, but the problem probably assumes the array has at least three elements.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef max_product_triplet(arr):\n    arr.sort()\n    candidate1 = arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3]\n    candidate2 = arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[-1]\n    return max(candidate1, candidate2)\n\nWait, but wait a minute, what about cases where another combination might be better?\n\nWait, for instance, in an array with four elements [ -10, 2, 3,4 ], the function returns the maximum between (2*3*4=24) and (-10*2*4=-80) \u2192 24. But in reality, the maximum product is 24, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the array [ -10, -9, 4,5,6 ].\n\ncandidate1 is 4*5*6=120.\n\ncandidate2 is (-10)*(-9)*6=540.\n\nSo function returns 540, correct.\n\nAnother test: when all elements are positive.\n\nFor example, [1,2,3,4]. candidate1: 2*3*4=24, candidate2: 1*2*4=8. So max is 24.\n\nBut the maximum triplet product is 2*3*4=24, correct.\n\nWait, another test: [ -1, 2,3,4,5 ].\n\ncandidate1:3*4*5=60.\n\ncandidate2:(-1)*2*5=-10 \u2192 function returns 60.\n\nWhich is correct, because 3*4*5 is the maximum triplet.\n\nBut in another variation, [ -100, 2,3,4,5 ].\n\ncandidate1 is 3*4*5=60.\n\ncandidate2 is (-100)*2*5= -1000.\n\nWait, so function returns 60. But wait, perhaps another triplet like 2*3*4=24 is less than 60.\n\nBut wait, in this array, the product of the first two elements and the last: -100*2*5= -1000, which is worse. The maximum triplet is indeed 3*4*5=60.\n\nWait, so the function returns 60, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when we have three large negatives and three large positives. Wait, for example [ -1000, -999, -1, 2,3,4 ].\n\ncandidate1 is 2*3*4=24.\n\ncandidate2 is (-1000)*(-999)*4= 3,996,000. So, function returns the correct maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the function works.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's consider an array of six elements: [ -10, -9, 1, 2, 3,4 ].\n\nSo, in this case, candidate1 is 2*3*4=24. candidate2 is (-10)*(-9)*4=360. So function returns 360.\n\nBut the other possible triplet, for example, [ -10, -9, 1,2,3,4 ]: could there be a triplet with 3 elements where two are negative, and one is positive, but not necessarily the last element.\n\nFor example, (-10)*(-9)*3=270, which is less than 360.\n\nAnother option: (-10)*(-9)*2=180, which is still less.\n\nSo function correctly chooses the higher product.\n\nBut wait, wait another example: [ -100, -99, 1,2,3,4,5 ].\n\ncandidate1 is 3*4*5=60.\n\ncandidate2 is (-100)*(-99)*5=50*99*5= 49500.\n\nSo function returns 49500, correct.\n\nThus, so far, all test cases I can think of are covered.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking of an array where the maximum product is not captured by either of the two candidates, but by a different triplet.\n\nBut then, in this approach, it's not considered.\n\nBut let me try to find such a case, if any exists.\n\nLet's think about an array [a, b, c, d, e], where a<=b<=c<=d<=e.\n\nSuppose a and b are negative, c is negative, d is positive, e is positive.\n\nSo, in this case, the two candidates are:\n\ncandidate1: c*d*e (which is negative * positive*positive \u2192 negative).\n\ncandidate2: a*b*e (negative*negative * positive \u2192 positive).\n\nBut there is a triplet: a, b, d. So their product is a*b*d, which would be positive as well. Maybe a*b*d could be larger than a*b*e?\n\nWait, for example: a=-10, b=-9, c=-5, d=2, e=3.\n\nSo, array: [ -10, -9, -5, 2,3 ].\n\ncandidate1: (-5)*2*3= -30.\n\ncandidate2: (-10)*(-9)*3= 270.\n\nBut what about the triplet a,b,d: (-10)*(-9)*2=180, which is less than 270, but more than -30. So in this case, the function returns 270, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's change d to 1 and e to 100:\n\narray: [ -10, -9, -5, 1,100 ].\n\ncandidate1: (-5)*1*100= -500.\n\ncandidate2: (-10)*(-9)*100= 9000.\n\nBut another triplet is a, b, 1: (-10)*(-9)*1=90, which is far less than 9000. So, function correctly returns 9000.\n\nAnother case: [ -10, -9, -8, 7,8,9 ].\n\ncandidate1: 7*8*9=504.\n\ncandidate2: (-10)*(-9)*9=810.\n\nSo function returns 810, correct.\n\nWait, but what about the triplet a, b, 8: (-10)*(-9)*8=720, which is less than 810.\n\nSo, function still correct.\n\nSo, perhaps in all cases, the maximum is either the last three, or the first two and the last one.\n\nTherefore, I think the function is solid.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing in Python, considering all these.\n\nBut I need to think about the case when the array has less than 3 elements. But probably, the function will raise an error, which is fine, but perhaps the problem statement assumes that the array has at least 3 elements.\n\nIn code, I can perhaps check len(arr)>=3, else return None or something, but the problem statement says it's an array, which I assume has at least three elements.\n\nSo writing function.\n\nWait, but the function is called 'max_product_triplet' but maybe it's better to handle empty cases, but I think as per the problem statement, we can assume arr has at least three elements.\n\nThus, the function can be written as:\n\ndef max_product_triplet(arr):\n    arr.sort()\n    # handle cases where length is 3\n    # product1 is last three (same as only triplet)\n    # product2 is first two and last, which same as product1 when len is 3\n    # so for len 3, returns the same product\n    candidate1 = arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3]\n    candidate2 = arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[-1]\n    return max(candidate1, candidate2)\n\nTesting this.\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,3,4]. Function returns max(2*3*4=24, 1*2*4=8) \u219224.\n\nTest case 2: [-1,2,3,4,5]. Function returns max(3*4*5=60, (-1)*2*5=-10) \u219260.\n\nTest case3: [ -100, -99, 2,3,4,5 ]. Function returns max(3*4*5=60, (-100)*(-99)*5=49500\u219249500.\n\nTest case4: [ -5, -4,3,4,5]. Function returns max(3*4*5=60, (-5)*(-4)*5=100\u2192100.\n\nTest case5: all negatives [ -5,-4,-3,-2,-1]. candidate1 is (-3)*(-2)*(-1)= -6. candidate2 is (-5)*(-4)*(-1)= -20. So the max is -6, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [ -10, -9, 1,2,3]. candidate1=1*2*3=6. candidate2=(-10)*(-9)*3=270. So returns 270.\n\nAnother case where candidate1 is higher: [ -1, -2, 3,4,5]. candidate1=3*4*5=60. candidate2=(-1)*(-2)*5=10. So returns 60.\n\nThus, the function seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum product of a triplet in an array that can contain both positive and negative numbers. The solution involves identifying potential triplets that could yield the highest product and comparing them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the largest and smallest elements, which are crucial for determining the maximum product.\n2. **Identify Key Triplets**: There are two primary cases to consider for the maximum product:\n   - The product of the three largest numbers.\n   - The product of the two smallest numbers (which could be negative) and the largest number. This case is important because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product, which could be large when multiplied by a positive number.\n3. **Compute and Compare**: Calculate the products for the two identified cases and return the maximum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_product_triplet(arr):\n    arr.sort()\n    candidate1 = arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3]\n    candidate2 = arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[-1]\n    return max(candidate1, candidate2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting helps in easily identifying the largest and smallest elements without additional complex computations.\n2. **Three Largest Numbers**: The product of the three largest numbers is computed by taking the last three elements of the sorted array.\n3. **Two Smallest and One Largest**: The product of the two smallest elements (which could be negative) and the largest element is computed by taking the first two elements and the last element of the sorted array.\n4. **Comparison**: The maximum product from the two computed candidates is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the potential triplets to just two cases, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
