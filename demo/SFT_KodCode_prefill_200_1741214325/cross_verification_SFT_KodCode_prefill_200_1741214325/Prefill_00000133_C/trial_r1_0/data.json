  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called multiply_by_three that takes a number and multiplies it by 3, then returns the result. Hmm, the function seems pretty straightforward. Wait, the user provided the code for that function twice, once as a docstring and another as a test case. I might be confused about what exactly the problem is. Oh right, maybe I'm supposed to correct the function so that it works with the provided docstring which includes the test cases.\n\nWait, looking at the first function definition, it has a docstring that says it multiplies by three and returns the result. The code just returns number *3, which seems correct. Then the second code block shows a function definition with a docstring that has some test cases. So perhaps the user wants the function to work such that when the test cases are run, the function's outputs match the expected results.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in writing the function and wants the function to be implemented correctly. Wait, the first function looks correct already. Unless maybe the user wants me to combine the two into a proper function with the correct docstring and implementation.\n\nWait, but the problem presented has a doctest maybe. The second function in the example shows a docstring with examples, perhaps using the doctest syntax. So maybe I need to write a function that passes those tests.\n\nLooking at the test cases, for 2, output is 6; 0 gives 0; -1 gives -3; 100 gives 300. Which are exactly what the function returns, so the function as written should pass those tests.\n\nSo perhaps the task is to just write the correct function with a proper docstring, including the examples.\n\nWait, let me see the initial function. The first version has a normal docstring explaining it multiplies and returns the result. The second version's docstring includes test cases, which seems like it's written in doctest format.\n\nSo, maybe what's needed is a function that, when the doctests are run, passes these examples. That requires that the function and the docstring correctly have those test cases.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user hasn't provided the correct function, or perhaps the second definition is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the first function is correct but the second is a way of showing test cases.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the first function has the correct implementation, and the second attempted function has a mistake but that the user wants me to correct the code, preserving the docstring.\n\nWait the function is written correctly in the first case. So perhaps the problem is non-existent and the function is already correct. Maybe the user wants me to explain the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is providing this as a problem to solve, and I should provide the correct function, adding a proper docstring.\n\nBut the problem statement is presented as writing multiply_by_three function. So perhaps the initial code is an example, and the solution involves rewriting it.\n\nAlternatively, looking again, perhaps I'm supposed to combine the two code snippets into a function that works correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the second function only contains a docstring but no implementation. Because when you look at the code, the second function is just a docstring with those test cases, and no body. So I should write a new function that includes that docstring and the correct implementation.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe problem statement includes two code blocks. The first is a function multiply_by_three with a docstring explaining what it does and returning number *3. The second code block is another multiply_by_three function but only has a docstring with examples.\n\nHmm, but in Python, only the last function definition in the code will remain, since each subsequent definition overrides the previous. So perhaps the correct approach is to have the function with the appropriate docstring and the correct body.\n\nSo, the correct function should have a docstring that includes the examples and the correct implementation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake when presenting the problem, and the function is supposed to be implemented with the right docstring including the test cases.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, I need to create a function multiply_by_three which returns three times the input number, and have its docstring include the test cases as shown in the second code block.\n\nSo putting it all together: the function should have a docstring that includes those specific test cases, and the code inside the function should correctly multiply the input by three.\n\nTherefore, the solution would be a combination of the correct implementation and the appropriate docstring with examples.\n\nThis way, when someone runs the doctests, they will pass, and the function behaves as intended.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function called `multiply_by_three` that takes a number as input, multiplies it by three, and returns the result. The function should be accompanied by a docstring that includes specific test cases demonstrating its usage and expected outputs. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward. We will define a function `multiply_by_three` that takes a single parameter `number`. The function will return the product of the input number and three. Additionally, we will include a docstring that provides a description of the function's purpose and several test cases to illustrate how the function behaves with different inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_three(number):\n    \"\"\" Multiply a number by 3 and return the result.\n    >>> multiply_by_three(2)\n    6\n    >>> multiply_by_three(0)\n    0\n    >>> multiply_by_three(-1)\n    -3\n    >>> multiply_by_three(100)\n    300\n    \"\"\"\n    return number * 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `multiply_by_three` is defined to take one parameter, `number`.\n- **Docstring**: The docstring explains the function's purpose and provides test cases that demonstrate expected behavior. These test cases use the doctest format, which allows them to be run as part of the function's testing.\n- **Implementation**: The function simply returns the result of multiplying the input `number` by three.\n\nThis solution ensures that the function is clear, concise, and well-documented, making it easy to understand and use. The included test cases help verify the function's correctness for various inputs, including positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers.",
