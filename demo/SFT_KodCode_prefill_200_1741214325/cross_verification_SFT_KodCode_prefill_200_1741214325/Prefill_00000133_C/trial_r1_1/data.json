  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I've got to figure out how to write a Python function called multiply_by_three that takes a number as input, multiplies it by three, and returns the result. Hmm, let's see. \n\nSo, functions in Python start with the 'def' keyword. I remember that. So I'll begin by writing 'def multiply_by_three(number):'. That sets up the function with one parameter, number.\n\nNext, inside the function, I need to multiply the given number by 3. Oh right, that's easy. So I can write a return statement like 'return number * 3;'. That should do it.\n\nWait, what about the different cases? Like, if the number is zero, or negative, will it handle that correctly? Let me think. Multiplying by three should work for any integer or float, positive or negative. So yeah, that should cover all cases.\n\nDo I need any error handling? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's not necessary for this simple function. I assume the input is a number since that's what's passed in.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function would look like:\n\ndef multiply_by_three(number):\n    return number * 3\n\nLet me test this with some examples. If I call multiply_by_three(2), it should return 6. Let's see in my head: 2 *3 is 6. Yep.\n\nWhat if it's zero? Multiply by three is still zero, so that works.\n\nWhat about a negative number? Like -1. Multiplying by 3 gives -3, which is correct.\n\nAnd a larger number, like 100, gives 300. That's right too.\n\nSo I think this should work. I guess there's no need for anything more complicated since the problem is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a single numerical argument and returns the result of multiplying that argument by three. The function should handle both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem is straightforward as it requires a simple multiplication operation. The approach involves defining a function that accepts a single parameter and returns the product of this parameter and the integer 3. This solution is efficient because multiplication is a constant-time operation, meaning it will work in O(1) time complexity regardless of the size of the input.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef multiply_by_three(number):\n    return number * 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `multiply_by_three` is defined to take one parameter, `number`.\n2. **Multiplication**: Inside the function, the input `number` is multiplied by 3 using the multiplication operator `*`.\n3. **Return Statement**: The result of the multiplication is returned immediately.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all cases including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero by leveraging Python's built-in multiplication capabilities. The function is concise and does not require any additional error handling beyond the scope of the problem's requirements.",
