  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have to find the solution for the user's problem. They mentioned two functions called multiply_by_three. The first one is a function that returns number *3 with a docstring explaining it. The second one is another function with the same name but a different docstring that includes some test cases.\n\nHmm, the user's main issue is probably about the function definitions and their docstrings, maybe testing. But looking deeper, I think the user is confused because they have two definitions of the same function. That's not possible in Python unless one overwrites the other.\n\nWait, the user might have intended to show a function with a detailed docstring, including examples, and another that's implemented. So perhaps the solution is to combine both, providing a function that meets the specifications in the docstring.\n\nLooking at the docstring in the second function, it includes examples like multiply_by_three(2) should return 6, and others. So I should write a function that correctly handles these cases. But since multiplying by three is straightforward, the function is simple.\n\nI should also include a proper docstring that explains the function and has the examples. Using the doctest format would be good so that the tests are clear. Wait, in the first function, the return part is correct, but the docstring could be improved. So maybe the correct approach is to write one function with the proper docstring that includes the examples as part of the documentation.\n\nWait, the second function also includes the same functionality. But perhaps the user is trying to learn how to write functions with proper docstrings and test cases. So the solution should be a single function with the correct implementation and a detailed docstring that includes usage examples.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function multiply_by_three takes a number, multiplies by 3, returns result. The docstring includes the description and examples. So the final code would be just that one correct function.\n\nI think I should write the function with the detailed docstring and ensure all examples work. The function is simple, but having the examples in the doc helps in testing.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that multiplies a given number by three and returns the result. The function should include a detailed docstring that explains its purpose and provides examples of its usage.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem requires a simple multiplication function. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Define a function named `multiply_by_three` that takes a single parameter, `number`.\n2. **Multiplication**: Inside the function, multiply the input `number` by three.\n3. **Return Result**: Return the result of the multiplication.\n4. **Docstring**: Include a docstring that describes the function's purpose and provides examples of its usage. This helps in understanding how the function works and what to expect from it.\n\nThe approach is straightforward as it involves a basic arithmetic operation. The function is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) since it involves a single multiplication operation.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_three(number):\n    \"\"\"Multiply a number by 3 and return the result.\n    \n    Args:\n        number (int or float): The number to be multiplied by 3.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int or float: The result of the multiplication.\n    \n    Examples:\n        >>> multiply_by_three(2)\n        6\n        >>> multiply_by_three(0)\n        0\n        >>> multiply_by_three(-1)\n        -3\n        >>> multiply_by_three(100)\n        300\n    \"\"\"\n    return number * 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `multiply_by_three` is defined to take one parameter, `number`.\n- **Multiplication Operation**: The function performs the operation `number * 3` and returns the result. This operation is efficient and runs in constant time.\n- **Docstring**: The docstring includes:\n  - A brief description of the function.\n  - An `Args` section describing the input parameter.\n  - A `Returns` section specifying the return value.\n  - An `Examples` section with usage examples that demonstrate how the function works, which is helpful for users to understand the function's behavior quickly.\n\nBy following this approach, the function is both simple and well-documented, making it easy to use and understand. The examples provided in the docstring can serve as test cases to verify the function's correctness.",
