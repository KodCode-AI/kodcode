  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to detect and remove duplicate elements from a list. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, one common way to remove duplicates is by converting the list into a set because sets don't allow duplicates. But wait, sets don't maintain the order of elements. Oh right, but if the list is using Python 3.7 or newer, the insertion order is preserved in sets. Or maybe I should use a different method to maintain the original order.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through the list and keep track of elements I've already seen. That way, I can add each element to a new list only once. So I can create an empty list for unique elements and a set to track seen elements.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Initialize an empty list to hold unique elements.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of elements we've seen.\n3. Loop through each element in the input list.\n4. For each element, check if it's in the seen set.\n5. If it's not in the set, add it to both the unique list and the seen set.\n6. If it's already in the set, skip it.\n7. Finally, return the unique list.\n\nThat sounds solid. Now, how about handling different data types? Since sets can handle any hashable type, integers, strings, floats should all work. What about unhashable types like lists or dictionaries? Well, the problem statement probably expects handling of typical elements, so I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the test case. I should test various scenarios:\n- An empty list should return an empty list.\n- A list with all unique elements should remain unchanged.\n- A list with duplicates should have them removed.\n- The order should be preserved, especially when duplicates are present.\n\nI'll create a test list with some duplicates, duplicate the order, and check if the output matches the expected unique elements in the correct order.\n\nWait, what about the original list? Should the function modify it or return a new list? Since the problem says \"remove,\" it's safer to return a new list and leave the original unchanged, which my approach does.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will be named remove_duplicates, take a list as input, and return the list with duplicates removed.\n\nTesting the function with a sample list like [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6] should return [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Let me make sure the test case covers this.\n\nI think that's a good plan. Now I'll write the code and test it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that removes duplicate elements from a given list while preserving the order of elements. The solution should handle typical data types such as integers, strings, and floats efficiently.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves iterating through the input list and using a set to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. This ensures that each element is added to the result list only once, thus removing duplicates. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Create an empty list to store unique elements and an empty set to track elements that have been added to the list.\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each element in the input list.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each element, check if it is already in the set.\n4. **Add Unique Elements**: If the element is not in the set, add it to both the list and the set.\n5. **Return the Result**: After processing all elements, return the list containing only unique elements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the order of elements is preserved as we iterate from the beginning to the end of the list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n    \"\"\"Remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving order.\"\"\"\n    seen = set()\n    unique_list = []\n    for element in input_list:\n        if element not in seen:\n            seen.add(element)\n            unique_list.append(element)\n    return unique_list\n\n# Test case\ndef test_remove_duplicates():\n    test_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]\n    expected_output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    assert remove_duplicates(test_list) == expected_output, \"Test failed: Output does not match expected.\"\n    print(\"Test passed.\")\n\ntest_remove_duplicates()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list as input and returns a new list with duplicates removed.\n- **Tracking Elements**: A set `seen` is used to track elements that have already been added to the result, ensuring efficient look-up and insertion operations.\n- **Order Preservation**: By iterating through the input list and adding each element only once in the order they appear, the function maintains the original order of elements.\n- **Test Case**: The test case verifies that the function correctly removes duplicates and preserves the order using a sample list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]`, which should result in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the removal of duplicates while preserving the order, making it suitable for a variety of use cases involving lists with potential duplicates.",
