  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that detects and removes duplicate elements from a list. Hmm, how do I approach this? Let me think. So, the function should take a list as input and return a new list without duplicates. But wait, should I modify the original list or create a new one? Maybe it's better to create a new list to avoid changing the original.\n\nFirst, I should figure out a way to track which elements I've already seen. Oh right, I can use a set for that because sets automatically handle uniqueness. So, I'll initialize an empty set called seen. Then, I'll create an empty list called unique_list.\n\nNext, I'll loop through each element in the input list. For each element, I'll check if it's not in the seen set. If it's not, I'll add it to both the seen set and the unique_list. That way, duplicates will be skipped because once an element is in seen, subsequent occurrences won't pass the condition.\n\nWait, what about the order of elements? Oh, right, using a set preserves the order because we're iterating through the original list and adding elements to unique_list in the same order, but only once. So that's good.\n\nNow, I need to write this in code. The function will be called remove_duplicates, take a list as an argument. Initialize seen as a set and unique_list as an empty list. Loop through each item in the input list. For each item, if item not in seen, add to both. Finally, return unique_list.\n\nTesting this function is important. I'll write a test case. Let's see, maybe test with a list that has duplicates, like [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]. The output should be [1,2,3,4,5]. Another test case with an empty list should return an empty list. What about a list with all unique elements? It should remain the same. Also, a list with all duplicates, like [5,5,5], should return [5].\n\nI think that's a good start. But wait, maybe I should consider edge cases, like when the list contains unhashable types, but the problem says elements, so assuming they're hashable. So, the function should handle most cases. I should write the test cases to cover these scenarios.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that removes duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of elements. The function should return a new list with unique elements without modifying the original list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Track Seen Elements**: Use a set to keep track of elements we have already encountered. This helps in quickly checking for duplicates.\n2. **Build Unique List**: Iterate through each element of the input list. For each element, check if it is in the set of seen elements. If it is not, add it to both the set and the new list.\n3. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return the new list which contains only unique elements.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed exactly once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list):\n    seen = set()\n    unique_list = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            seen.add(item)\n            unique_list.append(item)\n    return unique_list\n\n# Test cases\ndef test_remove_duplicates():\n    # Test case 1: List with duplicates\n    test_list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n    expected_output1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    assert remove_duplicates(test_list1) == expected_output1, \"Test case 1 failed.\"\n\n    # Test case 2: Empty list\n    test_list2 = []\n    expected_output2 = []\n    assert remove_duplicates(test_list2) == expected_output2, \"Test case 2 failed.\"\n\n    # Test case 3: All elements are unique\n    test_list3 = [5, 10, 15]\n    expected_output3 = [5, 10, 15]\n    assert remove_duplicates(test_list3) == expected_output3, \"Test case 3 failed.\"\n\n    # Test case 4: All elements are duplicates\n    test_list4 = [5, 5, 5]\n    expected_output4 = [5]\n    assert remove_duplicates(test_list4) == expected_output4, \"Test case 4 failed.\"\n\n    print(\"All test cases passed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_remove_duplicates()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `remove_duplicates` takes an input list and processes each element to build a new list of unique elements. It uses a set to track which elements have been seen, ensuring that each element is added to the result list only once. The test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicates, empty lists, all unique elements, and all duplicate elements, ensuring the function works correctly in all cases.",
