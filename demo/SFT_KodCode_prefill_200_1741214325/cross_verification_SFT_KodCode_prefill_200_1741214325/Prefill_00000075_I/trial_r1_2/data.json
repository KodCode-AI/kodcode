  "r1_response": "<think>\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfect number is. From what I remember, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.\n\nSo, to check if a number is perfect, I should find all its proper divisors. Proper divisors are the numbers that divide it exactly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.\n\nNext, I need to sum all these proper divisors. If the sum equals the original number, then the number is perfect; otherwise, it's not.\n\nFor the function itself, I'll start by handling edge cases. If the number is less than or equal to one, it can't be perfect, so I'll return False for those cases.\n\nThen, I'll initialize a sum to 1 because 1 is a proper divisor of every number except 1 itself. Starting from 2, I'll loop through possible divisors up to half of the given number, as any divisor larger than half would have already been accounted for by a smaller divisor.\n\nFor each number in this range, if it divides the given number without a remainder, I'll add both the divisor and the quotient to the sum, except when the divisor and quotient are the same, in which case I add it only once.\n\nAfter summing all proper divisors, I'll compare the total to the original number. If they're equal, the number is perfect.\n\nFinally, I'll test the function with known perfect numbers like 6 and 28 to ensure it works correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether a number is **perfect**, we need to check if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. Proper divisors of a number are the positive integers that divide the number exactly without leaving a remainder.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Perfect Numbers**: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the number is less than or equal to 1, it cannot be a perfect number. This is because 1 does not have proper divisors other than itself.\n\n3. **Calculate Proper Divisors**: For a given number, calculate all proper divisors. This can be done efficiently by iterating up to the square root of the number. For each divisor \\(i\\) found, both \\(i\\) and \\(\\frac{\\text{number}}{i}\\) are divisors. Make sure to avoid counting the number itself.\n\n4. **Sum the Divisors**: Sum all the proper divisors. If the sum equals the original number, it is a perfect number.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given number is a perfect number.\n    \n    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is perfect, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False  # By definition, perfect numbers are greater than 1\n    \n    total = 1  # Start with 1, since 1 is a proper divisor for all numbers > 1\n    sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5)  # Calculate square root once\n\n    # Check for divisors up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, sqrt_n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            total += i  # Add the divisor i\n            other_divisor = n // i\n            if other_divisor != i:  # Avoid adding duplicate when i and other_divisor are the same\n                total += other_divisor\n\n    return total == n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_perfect_number(6))   # Output: True\nprint(is_perfect_number(28))  # Output: True\nprint(is_perfect_number(12))  # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The function immediately returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 since they cannot be perfect numbers.\n\n2. **Proper Divisors Calculation**: The loop runs from 2 up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. For each divisor found, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient are added to the total sum, ensuring not to double-count when the divisor and quotient are the same.\n\n3. **Sum Comparison**: Finally, the sum of proper divisors is compared to the original number. If they are equal, the number is perfect, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for perfect numbers by reducing the number of iterations compared to checking all numbers up to \\(n-1\\), thus optimizing the solution.",
