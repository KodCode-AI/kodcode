  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called decimal_to_binary that converts a decimal number to its binary representation. But I can't use the built-in bin() function. Hmm, let's think about how to do this.\n\nSo, I remember that converting decimal to binary involves dividing the number by 2 and keeping track of the remainders. Let me recall the steps. Let's say for example, take n = 14.\n\nFirst, divide 14 by 2: quotient is 7, remainder is 0. Then 7 divided by 2 gives quotient 3, remainder 1. Then 3/2 is 1 rem 1. Then 1/2 is 0 rem 1. So the remainders are 0,1,1,1. But the binary is read from last remainder to first, so 1110, which is correct.\n\nSo the process is: while n is greater than 0, divide by 2, collect the remainders, build the binary string in reverse order.\n\nSo for the function:\n\nHandle the case when n is 0 separately, because if n is 0, the loop won't run and we should return \"0\".\n\nOtherwise, for n>0:\n\nInitialize an empty string or list to hold the bits. Using a list might be more efficient, since appending to a string in a loop is slow, but for small numbers it shouldn't matter. Let's use a list.\n\nWhile n > 0:\n\n- Get the remainder: remainder = n % 2\n- Append it to the list\n- Update n: n = n // 2\n\nOnce the loop is done, the list contains the binary digits in reverse order, so we need to reverse them.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the example of 14: the remainders are 0, 1, 1, 1. When the loop runs:\n\nn=14: 14%2=0, then append 0. n becomes 7.\nn=7: 7%2=1, append 1. n=3\nn=3: 3%2=1, append. n=1\nn=1: 1%2=1. append. n=0\nLoop stops.\n\nSo the list is [0,1,1,1], but the binary is 1110. So we need to reverse the list and then combine into a string.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    binary_digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // 2\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let's test for n=0. With the first condition, it returns \"0\". That's correct.\n\nTesting for n=1: loop runs once. remainder is 1, appends \"1\". then n becomes 0. reverse gives [ '1' ], joined is \"1\".\n\nFor n=2: loop steps:\n\nn=2: remainder 0, appends. n=1.\n\nn=1: rem 1, appends. n=0.\n\nList is [0,1], reversed and becomes [1,0], joined as \"10\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=5 \u2192 \"101\". Let's see:\n\nn=5: rem 1 \u2192 n=2\n\nn=2: rem 0 \u2192 n=1\n\nn=1: rem 1 \u2192 n=0.\n\nList is [1,0,1]. Reverse \u2192 [1,0,1]. Wait no:\n\nWait after collecting [1,0,1], when reversed it becomes [1,0,1]. Wait no, no, because when we collect the remainders as 5 mod 2 is 1 (n becomes 2), 2 mod 2 is 0, 1 mod 2 is 1.\n\nSo the list is [1, 0, 1]. Then reversed becomes [1,0,1] \u2192 no, wait no. Wait the initial list is [1,0,1]. Oh wait no, no no. Let's retrace:\n\nn=5: 5%2=1 \u2192 binary_digits appends 1. n=2.\n\nn=2: 0 \u2192 append. n=1.\n\nn=1: 1 \u2192 append. n=0.\n\nSo binary_digits is [1,0,1]. Then reverse() [1,0,1 becomes 1,0,1]. Wait, wait no, because [1,0,1] reversed is [1,0,1], same as before if the length is even? Wait no, reversing would change the order.\n\nWait in the case of 5: the list is [1,0,1]. So when reversed, it's reversed([1,0,1]) \u2192 would it be [1,0,1]? Because when you reverse [1,0,1], the first element becomes the last? Wait no:\n\nWait [1,0,1] has three elements. Reversed is (1,0,1) \u2192 the same as the original? No, wait no. Let's list them:\n\nIndexes 0:1, 1:0, 2:1.\n\nReversed indexes would be 2,1,0: so the elements are 1, 0, 1 again. Wait no, no. For the list [1, 0, 1], if you reverse it, you get [1, 0, 1], same as before because it's a palindrome.\n\nWait no, that's only in this specific case. What about the general case.\n\nWait, let's think with n=14. The list is [0,1,1,1]. When you reverse this list, it becomes [1,1,1,0], which is correct.\n\nWait, wait no, in the 14 example, the code correctly gets \"1110\". So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine n=5:\n\nWait n=5:\n\nn:5 \u2192 rem=1 \u2192 list [1] \u2192 n=2.\n\nn:2 \u2192 rem 0 \u2192 list [1,0] \u2192 n=1.\n\nn=1 \u2192 rem 1 \u2192 list [1,0,1] \u2192 n=0.\n\nSo list is [1,0,1]. So when we reverse, it's [1,0,1], which is same as before. But that joined would be \"101\", which is correct.\n\nWait no, no\u2014because 5 in binary is 101. So it's correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3:\n\nn=3%2=1 \u2192 list [1], n=1.\n\nn=1%2=1 \u2192 list [1,1], n=0.\n\nAfter reverse, it becomes [1,1], so \"11\" which is correct.\n\nWait n=4: n=4%2\u21920, list [0], n=2 \u2192 rem 0, list [0,0] \u2192 n=1.\n\nn=1 \u2192 rem 1, list [0,0,1]. Reverse \u2192 [1,0,0], which is \"100\" \u2192 correct.\n\nSo yes, the approach of appending and then reversing seems correct.\n\nWait, but wait: when you have n=15, for example:\n\n15 is 1111.\n\nSteps:\n\nn=15 \u2192 1 rem 1 \u2192 n=7.\n\nn=7 \u2192 1 rem 1 \u2192 n=3.\n\nn=3 \u2192 1 rem 1 \u2192 n=1.\n\nn=1 \u2192 1 rem 1 \u2192 n=0.\n\nbinary_digits is [1,1,1,1]. Reverse does nothing, but joined is \"1111\", correct.\n\nWait, wait no, wait appending the remainders as 1, then 7/2 is 3 rem 1 again. Oh, wait the n after each step:\n\nn = 15 //2 =7.\n\nn is 7: 7%2 is 1, append.\n\nn becomes 7//2=3.\n\nn=3: 3%2 is1, append.\n\nn=3//2=1.\n\nn=1: rem 1, append.\n\nn becomes 0.\n\nSo binary_digits is [1,1,1,1]. Then we reverse this list, which gives [1,1,1,1], same thing. So joined is correct.\n\nWait another case: n=6.\n\nn=6: rem 0 \u2192 list [0], n=3.\n\nn=3: rem 1 \u2192 list [0,1], n=1.\n\nn=1: rem 1 \u2192 list [0,1,1]. Reverse \u2192 [1,1,0] \u2192 \"110\" which is correct.\n\nYes, so the approach seems solid.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nHandle n=0 \u2192 return '0'.\n\nElse, loop:\n\ncollect remainders in binary_digits.\n\nreverse the list, then join as string.\n\nWait, but wait, how about for n=0, the code's first condition returns '0', which is correct.\n\nTesting on sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: decimal_to_binary(0) \u2192 \"0\". Correct.\n\nSample 2: decimal_to_binary(1) \u2192 \"1\". Correct.\n\nSample3: decimal_to_binary(2)\u2192\"10\".\n\nSample4: decimal_to_binary(3)\u2192\"11\".\n\nSample5: 4\u2192\"100\". Correct.\n\nSample6: 5\u2192\"101\".\n\nSample7: 14\u2192\"1110\".\n\nSample8: 255\u2192\"11111111\".\n\nSample9: 256\u2192\"100000000\"\n\nSample10: 1023\u2192\"1111111111\".\n\nThe code should handle all these.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? The test cases don't include any, so perhaps the function is only meant for non-negative integers. So assuming n is non-negative, or we should handle negatives if the function is called with negatives. The problem says decimal numbers, but the examples are non-negative. So perhaps the function should return for positive numbers as per the cases, but for negative, perhaps it should return an empty string or something? Or should we handle it? The problem description doesn't specify, so I'm assuming the function is supposed to handle non-negative integers.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if n=0? Handled.\n\n- What about when the while loop doesn't run, such as for n=0 \u2192 correctly handled.\n\nAnother test case, say n=10.\n\nbinary of 10 is 1010.\n\nLet's see: code should produce that.\n\nn=10: rem 0, append. n=5.\n\nn=5: rem 1, appends. \u2192 list is [0,1]. n=2.\n\nn=2: rem 0, appends \u2192 [0,1,0]. n=1.\n\nn=1: rem 1 \u2192 list [0,1,0,1]. Now reverse, which is [1,0,1,0], so \"1010\" which is correct.\n\nTesting in code:\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1 returns \"1\", correct.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number into its binary representation without using Python's built-in `bin()` function. The binary representation of a number can be found using a simple iterative process of division and remainder collection.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is straightforward and involves the following steps:\n1. **Special Case Handling**: If the input number is 0, directly return \"0\" as the binary representation of 0 is \"0\".\n2. **Iterative Division**: For numbers greater than 0, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and collect the remainders. These remainders represent the binary digits in reverse order.\n3. **Reversing the Remainders**: Once all remainders are collected, reverse the order of the list of remainders to get the correct binary representation.\n4. **String Construction**: Convert the list of remainders into a string and return it as the final result.\n\nThis method efficiently converts a decimal number to binary using a while loop and simple arithmetic operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    binary_digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // 2\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Special Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input `n` is 0. If true, it immediately returns \"0\" since the binary representation of 0 is \"0\".\n- **Collecting Remainders**: For non-zero values, the while loop continues dividing `n` by 2, collecting the remainder of each division. The remainder (either 0 or 1) is appended to a list `binary_digits`.\n- **Reversing the List**: After the loop completes, the list `binary_digits` contains the binary digits in reverse order. Reversing this list arranges the digits correctly.\n- **String Construction**: The reversed list is then joined into a single string which is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently convert the decimal number to its binary equivalent without using any built-in functions, adhering to the problem constraints.",
