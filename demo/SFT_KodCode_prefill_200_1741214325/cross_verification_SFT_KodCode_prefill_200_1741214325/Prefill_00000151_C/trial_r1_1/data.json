  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have to write a Python function called decimal_to_binary that converts a decimal number to its binary string representation. And I can't use the built-in bin() function. Hmm, let's think about how to do this.\n\nSo, first, I remember that converting a decimal to binary involves dividing the number by 2 and keeping track of the remainders. Right. Each division gives a remainder which is either 0 or 1, which becomes a bit in the binary number.\n\nWait, but what's the process step by step? Let's see:\n\nTake a number, n. Divide by 2. The remainder is the least significant bit. Then divide the quotient again by 2, and get the next bit, and so on until the quotient is zero. The binary number is the remainders read in reverse order.\n\nBut wait, in what order do I collect the remainders? Like, let's take n=5. \n\n5 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 1.\n2 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 0.\n1 divided by 2 is 0 with remainder 1.\nSo the remainders are 1, 0, 1. But we read them in reverse, so the binary is 101.\n\nOkay, so the function should collect the remainders each time, then reverse them at the end to get the correct binary string.\n\nBut what about the case when n is 0? Because dividing 0 by 2 repeatedly doesn't give any remainders. So the function should return \"0\" in that case.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Handle the case when n is 0: return \"0\" immediately.\n2. Initialize an empty list to collect the binary digits.\n3. While n is greater than 0:\n   a. Divide n by 2.\n   b. The remainder (n % 2) is the next digit. Append this to the list.\n   c. Update n to be the quotient (n // 2).\n4. After exiting the loop, reverse the list of digits to get the correct order.\n5. Join the list into a string and return it.\n\nWait, but in the examples, for n=0 we have '0'. How do we handle that. Because if n is 0, the loop won't run. So after the loop, if the binary_digits list is empty, we just return '0'.\n\nSo maybe, before processing, check if n is 0: return '0'. Else, perform the steps.\n\nLet's test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1: n=1.\nLoop enters because n=1>0.\nn%2 is 1. Append to binary_digits. Now, binary_digits is [1].\nn becomes 0.\nLoop ends.\nReverse binary_digits: [1], so binary is \"1\".\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nExample 2: n=2.\nLoop: 2//2 is 1, remainder 0 \u2192 append 0. n is now 1.\nNext iteration: 1//2 is 0, remainder 1 \u2192 append 1. n is 0.\nbinary_digits is [0,1].\nReverse: [1,0] \u2192 \"10\".\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n3 divided by 2, remainder 1 \u2192 list [1], n=1.\n1 divided by 2, remainder 1 \u2192 list [1,1], n=0.\nReverse gives 11.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat about n=14:\n\nLet's compute the remainders:\n\n14 /2 \u2192 7 rem 0 \u2192 list [0]\n7/2 \u2192 3 rem1 \u2192 [0,1]\n3/2 \u2192 1 rem1 \u2192 [0,1,1]\n1/2 \u2192 0 rem1 \u2192 [0,1,1,1]\nSo list is [0,1,1,1], reverse \u2192 1110. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=256.\n\n256 divided by 2 is 128 rem 0\n128 /2 is 64 rem0\n64 \u2192 32 rem0\n32 \u219216 rem0\n16\u21928 rem0\n8\u21924 rem0\n4\u21922 rem0\n2\u21921 rem0\n1\u21920 rem1\nSo remains are [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. After reversing it's 1 followed by 8 zeros, resulting in '100000000'. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems to work.\n\nImplementing this in code.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Check if n is 0; return '0'.\n- Else, collect remainders as I go, then reverse and create the string.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nSo in the function:\n\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    if n ==0:\n        return \"0\"\n    binary_digits = []\n    while n >0:\n        remainder = n %2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n //2\n    # Now reverse the list\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    # join and return\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n\nWait, but what if N is 1? Wait for n=1:\n\nn is greater than 0: append 1, n becomes 0. Loop exits. reverse [1], so returns '1' \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case: n=0, return '0'. All other cases, collect the remainders, reverse, join.\n\nLet's test the code with the given examples.\n\nWait, but let's make a table of test cases:\n\nTest n=0 \u2192 returns '0'.\nn=1 \u2192 '1'.\nn=2 \u2192 '10'?\nWait, in the code: for n=2, the remainders collected are 0 (since 2%2 is 0, and n becomes 1. Then, 1%2 is 1, n becomes 0. So binary_digits = ['0','1'], reversed to ['1','0'] \u2192 '10' as required.\n\nSo seems correct.\n\nWait, I'm trying to think: when n is even vs odd. Like, for 5:\n\nn starts as 5.\n\n5%2=1 \u2192 list [1], n=2.\n2%2=0 \u2192 list [1,0], n=1.\n1%2=1 \u2192 list [1,0,1], n=0.\nReversed \u2192 101 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, this logic works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number into its binary string representation without using Python's built-in `bin()` function. The solution involves repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and collecting the remainders to form the binary digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Special Case for Zero**: If the input number is zero, the function should immediately return \"0\".\n2. **Initialize an Empty List**: This list will be used to collect the binary digits obtained from each division step.\n3. **Repeated Division by 2**: While the number is greater than zero, repeatedly divide the number by 2. The remainder from each division (which can only be 0 or 1) is collected. Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n4. **Reverse the Collected Remainders**: After completing the divisions, reverse the order of the collected remainders to form the correct binary string.\n5. **Join and Return**: Convert the list of binary digits into a string and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    binary_digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // 2\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Special Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input number is zero and returns \"0\" immediately because zero in binary is simply \"0\".\n2. **Collecting Remainders**: For non-zero numbers, the function enters a loop where it repeatedly divides the number by 2. The remainder from each division is collected into a list. This remainder represents the least significant bit of the current state of the number.\n3. **Reversing the Order**: After the loop completes (when the number becomes zero), the collected remainders are in reverse order. Reversing this list gives the correct binary representation.\n4. **Forming the String**: The reversed list of binary digits is then joined into a single string, which is the final binary representation of the input number.\n\nThis approach efficiently converts a decimal number to its binary string representation by leveraging the properties of division and remainders, ensuring correctness and simplicity.",
