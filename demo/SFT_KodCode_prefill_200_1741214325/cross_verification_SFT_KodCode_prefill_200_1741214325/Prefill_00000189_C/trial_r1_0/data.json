  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to determine if a given number is a Fibonacci number. Hmm, I remember that Fibonacci numbers have some special properties. Oh right, there's a mathematical test for it.\n\nWait, I think it has something to do with perfect squares. Right! A number n is a Fibonacci number if either 5n\u00b2 + 4 or 5n\u00b2 -4 is a perfect square. So I need to check both of these conditions.\n\nFirst, I should calculate 5*n*n +4 and see if it's a square. But wait, what's a perfect square? Oh, a number that's the square of an integer. So I need a helper function to check if a number is a perfect square.\n\nHow do I check that? Maybe take the square root, round it to an integer, and then square it again to see if we get back the original number. That makes sense. So if s is the square root of x, then s squared should equal x exactly.\n\nSo the function is_perfect_square would take x, compute s as the integer square root, then check s squared equals x.\n\nNow, for the is_fibonacci function. It'll take n. Then compute 5n\u00b2 +4 and 5n\u00b2 -4. Check each of these using the is_perfect_square function. If either returns True, then n is a Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, what about n being zero or one? Let's think. The Fibonacci sequence usually starts with 0 and 1, then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two, so 0,1,1,2,3,5, etc. So testing n=0: 5*0 +4 is4, which is sqrt(4)=2, square is 4: yes, so 0 is considered a Fibonacci number. What about n=1: 5*(1)^2=5, plus 4 is9, whose sqrt is3, and 3\u00b2 is9. So yes, so it works.\n\nWhat about edges? Like n=2: 5*4=20, plus4 is24. Is 24 a perfect square? No, because 4\u00b2 is16 and 5\u00b2 is25, so no. Wait, wait: 5*2\u00b2 is20, so 5n\u00b2 is20, so +4 is24, and -4 is16. So 16 is 4\u00b2, so yes. So 2 is a Fibonacci number. Indeed, 2 is the fourth Fibonacci number.\n\nTesting n=3: 5*9=45 +4=49 is 7\u00b2, yes, so returns True.\n\nAlright, so the logic seems solid.\n\nWait, let me think about when n is negative. Because the problem says n is an integer, but what if n is negative? Since square is same for positive and negative, but our helper function will compute s as the integer square root, which for negative numbers would be an imaginary number. But wait, no, because in the helper function, x has to be non-negative because it's being square-rooted. So if n is negative, 5n\u00b2 is same as positive, so for n negative, 5n\u00b2 +4 is positive. But since our helper function returns False for x negative, but wait, what if x is negative? Oh wait, but when n is negative, 5n\u00b2 is positive. So 5n\u00b2 +4 is always positive. So the helper function is_perfect_square should not have a problem.\n\nWait, more precisely: when is x positive? For 5n\u00b2 +4, since n\u00b2 is always non-negative, 5n\u00b2 is non-negative, adding 4 gives x as at least 4, so x is positive. Same for 5n\u00b2-4: even if n is 1, 5*1=5-4=1 which is positive. For n=0, 0-4 is -4. Oh right, but n is 0 in that case. Let's see.\n\nWait, when n is 0, 5n\u00b2 +4 is 4, which is perfect square. So our function will return True, which is correct. But 5n\u00b2 -4 becomes 5*0 -4= -4, and is_perfect_square(-4) will compute s as sqrt(-4) which is imaginary, but in Python, taking the square root of a negative number using **0.5 gives an error. So how is is_perfect_square handling x negative? Let's think about the helper function.\n\nIn is_perfect_square, the code is s = int(x**0.5). But if x is negative, it'll throw an error. Because in Python, taking the square root of a negative number when using floating point operations returns a complex number, but when you cast it to int, an error occurs? Wait, no, actually, what happens is that for x negative, x**0.5 is a complex number. So when trying to compute s, you'll get an error. So in that case, is_perfect_square of -4 will cause an error because x is negative, right?\n\nWait, no, in Python, if you compute, say, (-4)**0.5, you get a complex number. But if you do x**0.5 where x is negative, it does produce a complex number which can't be cast to int without an error. So perhaps the helper function needs to handle negative x first.\n\nSo to prevent that, I should have a condition before. Like, if x is negative, return False immediately because negative numbers aren't perfect squares.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. So in the helper function, first check if x is negative: if yes, return False.\n\nSo for example, when n is 0, 5n\u00b2-4 is -4. So isPerfectSquare(-4) will return False, but isPerfectSquare(4) returns True, so the function correctly returns True because one of the conditions is met.\n\nTherefore, in the helper function, I'm going to start with: if x < 0, return False.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's adjust the helper function.\n\nSo, in is_perfect_square:\n\nif x < 0:\n    return False\ns = int(math.sqrt(x))\nreturn s*s == x\n\nWait, but in the original code, I use x **0.5. Maybe using math.sqrt is better because it returns a float, but also, math.sqrt will error for negative x, but our function will have already handled x <0.\n\nAlternatively, in the helper function, compute math.sqrt(x) after checking x >=0.\n\nSo, I think the helper function should handle x negative, perhaps by returning False. Such that, for x negative, is_perfect_square returns False.\n\nOtherwise, compute s as the integer of the square root of x, then check s squared equals x.\n\nOkay, so for the helper function:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = int(math.sqrt(x))\n    return s * s == x\n\nWait, but why do I need math.sqrt? Because in the original I used x**0.5. Oh wait, because in the original code, no math module is imported.\n\nWait, in the original code, it's using x**0.5, but perhaps x is a large number, like 5n\u00b2 could be very big. So perhaps using **0.5 method is okay.\n\nBut let's think about whether the helper function is correct as initially written.\n\nWait, the original code for is_perfect_square is:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    s = int(x ** 0.5)\n    return s * s ==x\n\nBut if x is negative, computing x**0.5 will give a complex number, and trying to take int of that will cause a TypeError in Python, right?\n\nFor example, if x is -4, x**0.5 is (2j), so int(2j) is a problem.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's test this:\n\nIn Python, if you try (-4)**0.5, it actually gives an error because exponentiating a negative to a fractional power is undefined in the real numbers, but in Python, it returns a complex number if using ** operator.\n\nWait no, wait, in Python, when you do (-4) ** 0.5, it returns a complex number: specifically, it returns 2j. Because 0.5 is equivalent to 1/2, and (-4) ** (1/2) is the square root of negative 4, which is 2j.\n\nSo attempting to assign s = int(2j) would fail. Because 2j is a complex number, and int() cannot convert a complex number to an integer.\n\nWait, no, let's test it:\n\nIn the code:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    s = int(x ** 0.5)\n    return s * s == x\n\nIf x is -4, x**0.5 is (2j), then trying to convert that to int gives an error because complex numbers can't be directly converted to int.\n\nThus, calling is_perfect_square(-4) will throw an error. So that's a problem, especially in the case where n is 0, because 5*0^2 -4 is -4, so 5n\u00b2-4 is -4, so trying to compute isPerfectSquare(-4) will throw an error.\n\nThus, in the code, that's a bug. To fix it, the helper function must first check if x is negative, return False, before computing s.\n\nSo in the is_perfect_square function, the first step is:\n\nif x < 0:\n    return False\ns = int(math.sqrt(x))\nBut wait, if x is a float, or when using x**0.5, which may give a float, but in the original function, perhaps we can handle that.\n\nWait, no, in the original code, the function uses x ** 0.5, which for positive x is a float, and int returns the integer part. But for x negative, it returns a complex number, which as we saw, is a problem.\n\nThus, to fix this, the helper function needs to check for x < 0 and return False.\n\nTherefore, the correct helper function should have:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = int(x ** 0.5)\n    return s * s == x\n\nWait, but wait: what about x is a perfect square but when taking x**0.5, it's a float which, when converted to int, becomes the correct integer, but when x is a perfect square. For example, x=25, 25**0.5 is 5.0, then s is 5, so yes.\n\nBut wait, what about 26**0.5 is 5.099..., which when converted to int is 5. Then 5*5 is 25, which is less than 26, so returns False, which is correct.\n\nBut another approach is to use math.isqrt in Python 3.8 and above, which returns the integer square root, so no casting is needed. Because math.isqrt(x) returns the largest integer s such that s\u00b2 <=x, and is faster and more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, for better functionality, we could modify is_perfect_square to handle x <0, then calculate s as the integer part of the square root.\n\nSo, for the is_perfect_square function:\n\nHandle x <0: return False.\n\nCompute s as integer closest integer to sqrt(x). But how?\n\nAnother approach is to compute s as math.isqrt(x), which returns the integer part.\n\nBut since math.isqrt is available from Python 3.8, perhaps it's better to use math.sqrt and then cast to int.\n\nSo integrating all that:\n\nUpdate is_perfect_square to:\n\nif x <0: return False.\n\nelse compute sqrt using x ** 0.5, cast to int, then s squared ==x.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = int(x ** 0.5)\n    return s * s == x\n\nWait, but this may not always work, due to floating point inaccuracies.\n\nFor example, x = 16843009\u00b2. Wait, perhaps it's better to use a method that correctly computes the square without inaccuracies.\n\nBut given that n is an int, and 5n\u00b2 is manageable as an int, which when added or subtracted by 4, can be a very big x.\n\nAnother issue is that for very large x, the square could be imprecisely calculated as a float, leading to incorrect results when converting to int.\n\nThus, perhaps using something like math.isqrt is better because it handles large integers more accurately and efficiently. However, this requires importing math and using math.isqrt, which returns the integer square root.\n\nSo to handle all cases, perhaps the helper function should be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = math.isqrt(x)\n    return s * s == x\n\nThis way, it's precise and handles large x.\n\nSo, I should adjust the helper function.\n\nThus, the initial code should have these corrections.\n\nSo, putting it all together: in the helper function, check for x <0, then compute s using math.isqrt, then see if s\u00b2 == x.\n\nSo the steps to implement:\n\n1. In is_perfect_square, handle x <0, return False.\n\n2. Compute s = math.isqrt(x).\n\n3. Check s*s ==x.\n\nSo with these changes, the functions should correctly handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, in the is_fibonacci_number function, the code would be:\n\ndef is_fibonacci_number(n: int) -> bool:\n    return is_perfect_square(5 * n * n +4) or is_perfect_square(5 *n *n -4)\n\nAnd the helper function is as above.\n\nWait, but what about very large n? For example, n= 2971215073, which is a Fibonacci number.\n\nTesting with this function should correctly return True.\n\nAnother test case: n=4. 5*16=80. 80+4=84: not a square. 80-4=76: 76 is not a square. Wait, wait\u2014is 4 a Fibonacci number? Wait yes, 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, etc.\n\nWait wait, 5*4\u00b2=5*16=80. 80-4=76. Wait, what is sqrt(76)? 8.72... no, so would the function correctly return False? But wait, 4 is a Fibonacci number, so why is 5*n\u00b2-4 not a square.\n\nWait wait\u2014wait 5*4\u00b2+4 =84.\n\nWait, 84 is not a square.\n\nWait, but 5*4^2 -4 =80-4=76, which is also not a square.\n\nWait wait, then why is 4 considered a Fibonacci number in that test?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier assessment. Wait no: according to the Fibonacci sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, etc. So 4 is not a Fibonacci number. Wait\u2014so it's correct to return False for 4? Or is 4 perhaps a Fibonacci number?\n\nNo, wait\u2014 Fib sequence is 0 (1st?), 1 (2nd), 1, 2, 3, 5. So 4 is not in the sequence. So the function would correctly return False.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 4 was a Fibonacci number but maybe I was wrong.\n\nWait, the nth Fibonacci numbers:\n\nn=0: 0\n\nn=1:1\n\nn=2:1\n\nn=3:2\n\nn=4:3\n\nn=5:5\n\nn=6:8\n\nNo, 4 isn't in there.\n\nSo for n=4, the function correctly returns 5*4^2 +4 = 5*16+4=84, 5*16-4=76, neither of which is a perfect square, so function returns False, which is correct.\n\nBut let me test another case where n is a Fibonacci number. Let's take n=5.\n\n5*n\u00b2 =5*25=125.\n\n125+4=129: not a square.\n\n125-4=121: which is 11\u00b2. So isPerfectSquare(121) returns True.\n\nTherefore, the function returns True.\n\nSimilarly, n=2:\n\n5*(2)^2 +4= 20+4=24 \u2192 not a square.\n\n5*4-4=16 \u2192 which is 4\u00b2 \u2192 yes. So returns True.\n\nYes.\n\nSo function is correct.\n\nBut, to account for the case when n=0:\n\n5*0\u00b2 +4=4 \u2192 2\u00b2 \u2192 so returns True.\n\nWhich is correct as 0 is a Fibonacci number.\n\nSo function is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1.\n\n5*1+4=9 \u21923\u00b2 \u2192 so returns True.\n\nThus, the function is correct.\n\nPotential problem I saw earlier was helper function failing on negative x. Now, with the helper function handling x <0 as return False, and using math.isqrt, which is precise, it should be correct.\n\nHence, the code solution is as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer \\( n \\) is a Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers have a special property that can be checked using a mathematical test involving perfect squares.\n\n### Approach\nA number \\( n \\) is a Fibonacci number if and only if at least one of \\( 5n^2 + 4 \\) or \\( 5n^2 - 4 \\) is a perfect square. To check if a number is a perfect square, we compute its integer square root and verify if squaring this root gives back the original number. The steps involved are as follows:\n\n1. **Check for Perfect Square**: A helper function `is_perfect_square(x)` is used to determine if a number \\( x \\) is a perfect square. This function first handles negative numbers by returning False immediately. For non-negative numbers, it computes the integer square root and checks if squaring this root returns the original number.\n2. **Fibonacci Check**: The main function `is_fibonacci_number(n)` computes both \\( 5n^2 + 4 \\) and \\( 5n^2 - 4 \\) and uses the helper function to check if either of these values is a perfect square.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_fibonacci_number(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Returns True if n is a Fibonacci number, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n    return is_perfect_square(5 * n * n + 4) or is_perfect_square(5 * n * n - 4)\n    \ndef is_perfect_square(x: int) -> bool:\n    if x < 0:\n        return False\n    s = math.isqrt(x)\n    return s * s == x\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function `is_perfect_square`**:\n   - This function takes an integer \\( x \\) and checks if it is a perfect square.\n   - If \\( x \\) is negative, it returns False immediately since negative numbers cannot be perfect squares.\n   - For non-negative \\( x \\), it computes the integer square root using `math.isqrt(x)` which efficiently handles very large numbers without floating-point inaccuracies.\n   - The function then squares this integer root and checks if it equals the original number \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Main Function `is_fibonacci_number`**:\n   - This function tests if \\( n \\) is a Fibonacci number by checking the conditions involving perfect squares.\n   - It computes both \\( 5n^2 + 4 \\) and \\( 5n^2 - 4 \\) and uses the helper function to check if either of these values is a perfect square.\n   - If either condition is satisfied, the function returns True, indicating that \\( n \\) is a Fibonacci number; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines if a number is in the Fibonacci sequence using mathematical properties and handles edge cases such as negative numbers and very large values robustly.",
