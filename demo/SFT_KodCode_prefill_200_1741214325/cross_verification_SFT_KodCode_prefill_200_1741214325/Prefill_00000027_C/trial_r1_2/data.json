  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called union_of_lists that takes two lists of integers and returns their union. Let's think about what a union means. Oh right, the union of two sets is all the elements that are in either of them, but without duplicates. So the output should be a list containing each unique element from both lists, but each appearing only once.\n\nAlright, so looking at the examples, the first one is [1,2,3] union [3,4,5] gives [1,2,3,4,5]. That makes sense. The second example has duplicates in the input lists, but the output has each number once.\n\nSo, how to approach this? I think the standard way is to combine both lists, then create a set to remove duplicates, and then sort it? Wait, wait, but the order in the examples is preserving the order of elements. Wait, no. In the examples, the output is ordered as elements appear, but union in sets doesn't maintain order. But in the examples, like the first one, it's [1,2,3,4,5], which is the order of combining the first list and then the second, adding elements not already present.\n\nWait, let me check the examples again. The second example input is [1,2,2,3] and [3,3,4,4,5]. The output is [1,2,3,4,5]. So the output lists the elements in the order of their first occurrence.\n\nSo the task is similar to combining the two lists and then making sure each element appears only once, but in the order they first appear, considering both lists.\n\nWait, but in which order do we process the elements? Like, for elements that are in both lists, which one's first occurrence determines the order in the final list?\n\nHmm, looking at the examples, perhaps the function needs to return a list that contains all unique elements from both lists, but the order is the order in which elements appear when going through list1 first, then list2, adding each element if it hasn't been added before.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first example, the first list is [1,2,3], so 3 is already in it. The second list has [3,4,5], but when we add them, 3 is already present, so it's not added again. So the result is 1,2,3 (from list1), then 4 and 5 (from list2).\n\nWait, but what if list1 has elements in a certain order, and list2 has some elements new but earlier in list2 but after in order? Maybe it's about going through list1 first, then list2, and adding elements only once, preserving the order of their first occurrence.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Iterate through list1, adding each element to a new list only if it hasn't been added before (including from list2's elements that come before in the order).\n2. Then, iterate through list2, adding each element only if it's not already in the new list.\n3. Or, perhaps, first add elements from list1, making them unique, then from list2, adding only those not already present.\n\nWait, perhaps the way is to collect all elements from list1, but only once, and then take elements from list2 that are not in list1, again only once.\n\nSo, to do this, I can create a new list. Start by processing list1, and for each element, add it to the new list only if it's not already there. Then process list2, adding elements not already in the new list.\n\nWait, let me think about it. For each element in list1, add it unless it's already in the result. Then for each in list2, same.\n\nBut wait, since duplicates in the same list \u2014 like if list1 has [1,1,2], then in the result it should only appear once.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize an empty list for the result.\n- Also, have a set to keep track of already added elements for quick lookup.\n- Iterate over list1, adding elements not in the set. If not present, add to result and the set.\n- Then, iterate over list2, do the same: for each element, if not in the set, add to the result and the set.\n- Finally, return the result list.\n\nYes, that should cover all cases. The order will be first the elements from list1 in the order they appear (adding each only once), and then the new elements from list2 in the order they appear (again, adding each only once).\n\nSo that's the plan. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe function signature is given: it takes two List[int] and returns a List[int].\n\nSo here's the step-by-step code outline:\n\nCreate an empty list, let's say 'result', and a set 'seen' to track elements.\n\nLoop through each num in list1:\n    if num not in seen:\n        append num to result\n        add num to seen set\nLoop through each num in list2:\n    same as above.\n\nReturn result.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's test this logic against the examples:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nlist1 = [1,2,3], list2 = [3,4,5]\n\nProcess list1:\n- 1 not in seen: add to result. result = [1], seen={1}\n- 2: not in seen, add. result now [1,2], seen has 2.\n- 3: add, result [1,2,3], seen has 3.\n\nThen process list2:\n- 3 is in seen, skip.\n-4: not in seen: add. result becomes [1,2,3,4], seen adds 4.\n-5: add, final result [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nlist1 = [1,2,2,3], list2 = [3,3,4,4,5]\n\nProcess list1:\n\n1 \u2192 added.\n2 \u2192 added.\nNext 2 is in seen, so skipped.\n3 added. So result after list1 is [1,2,3].\nProcess list2:\n3 present, skip.\n3 again, skip.\n4 not present: add. result [1,2,3,4]\n4: in seen, skip.\n5: added, final [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nThird case: first list empty.\n\nunion_of_lists([], [1,2,3]) \u2192 [1,2,3].\n\nProcess list1: nothing added.\nProcess list2: 1,2,3 added in order: final as expected.\n\nFourth case: list2 is empty \u2192 returns list1 with duplicates removed, but in our code, it correctly ensures that duplicates are handled.\n\nWait, because when list1 is like [1,2,2,2], the code when processing list1 would only add 1 and 2.\n\nSo for example, in the code, when processing list1, each element is checked before adding, so the code takes care of duplicates in each list.\n\nThus, the code correctly handles all the test cases.\n\nNow, think about any possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if an element appears multiple times in both lists, but spread across?\n\nLike list1 = [2,1,2], list2 = [1,3,1]. The result should be [2,1,3].\n\nWhich aligns with the code.\n\nAnother case: elements in the second list are already present in the first, but none duplicated.\n\nNow, in terms of type annotations, the function expects both parameters to be List[int], and returns List[int], so all is fine.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    seen = set()\n    for num in list1:\n        if num not in seen:\n            result.append(num)\n            seen.add(num)\n    for num in list2:\n        if num not in seen:\n            result.append(num)\n            seen.add(num)\n    return result\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nSample 1: Correct.\n\nSample 2: Correct.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the union of two lists of integers, ensuring that each element appears only once in the result and the order of appearance is preserved according to their first occurrence in either list.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a list to store the result and a set to keep track of elements that have already been added to avoid duplicates.\n2. **Iterate Through the First List**: For each element in the first list, add it to the result list if it hasn't been added before (using the set for quick lookup).\n3. **Iterate Through the Second List**: Similarly, for each element in the second list, add it to the result list if it hasn't been added before, using the same set for tracking.\n4. **Return the Result List**: After processing both lists, return the result list which contains the union of the elements in the order they first appeared.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is added only once and in the correct order based on their first occurrence in either of the input lists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    seen = set()\n    for num in list1:\n        if num not in seen:\n            result.append(num)\n            seen.add(num)\n    for num in list2:\n        if num not in seen:\n            result.append(num)\n            seen.add(num)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with an empty list `result` to store the final output and an empty set `seen` to track elements that have already been added to `result`.\n- **Processing List1**: For each element in `list1`, if it is not in `seen`, it is added to both `result` and `seen`.\n- **Processing List2**: Similarly, each element in `list2` is checked against `seen`, and if it is not present, it is added to both `result` and `seen`.\n- **Result**: The `result` list is returned, containing the union of elements from both lists without duplicates, preserving the order of their first occurrence.\n\nThis method efficiently handles duplicates and ensures the correct order, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
