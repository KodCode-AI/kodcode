  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called union_of_lists that takes two lists of integers and returns their union as a list. Hmm, the examples show that the union should contain each element once, even if it appears in both lists, similar to a set's union. But since lists can have duplicates, I guess my function should treat each element only once in the output, regardless of how many times they appear in either list.\n\nWait, but how are the elements ordered? Looking at the examples, first example: [1,2,3] union [3,4,5] gives [1,2,3,4,5]. So it seems that the order is preserved in the way that elements come from the first list, adding any new elements from the second list that aren't in the first, in the order they appear in the second list.\n\nOr maybe the function just needs to collect all unique elements from both lists and return them in a way that combines both, perhaps in the order they appear in the first list, then the second. But in the second example, [1,2,2,3] and [3,3,4,4,5] become [1,2,3,4,5]. So the order is adding from the first list's unique elements, followed by the unique elements from the second that are not in the first.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the result is the sorted list, but no, the first example's output is [1,2,3,4,5] which is in order, and so are the second. But I don't think sorting is required here because the examples are showing the same order as if elements from list1 come first, followed by new elements from list2.\n\nWait no, the first example's two lists are [1,2,3], [3,4,5], and the union is [1,2,3,4,5]. Which is the elements in the first list in order, followed by elements from the second list that aren't already in the first.\n\nSo the approach is to go through list1, adding elements to a result list if they haven't been added before. Then do the same for list2: for each element in list2, if it's not already in the result, add it.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to combine both lists, then create a set to find unique elements, and then order them based on the order of their first occurrence in either list.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the problem requires maintaining this order. Since the examples show that, probably yes.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is:\n\n1. Create an empty set to keep track of elements we've already added.\n2. Create the result list, starting with elements from list1 that are not in the set. For each element in list1, if it's not in the set, add it to the result and the set.\n3. Then do the same for list2: iterate through each element. If it's not in the set, add to result and set.\n4. Return the result list.\n\nYes, that would handle the cases correctly.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn the first sample, list1 is [1,2,3], so the result becomes [1,2,3], and the set is {1,2,3}. Then processing list2: 3 is already there, so skip. 4 is new, add to result, set. 5 is new, add. So result is [1,2,3,4,5], which is correct.\n\nIn the second example, list1 is [1,2,2,3]. Processing it:\n\nAdd 1 to result and set.\n\n2 is not in set, add.\n\nWhen 2 comes again in list1, it's already in set, skip.\n\n3 is added.\n\nResult after list1 is [1,2,3], set is {1,2,3}.\n\nThen process list2 [3,3,4,4,5]:\n\n3 is already present, skip all later 3s.\n\n4 is not in set, add to result, and set.\n\n4 again, skipped.\n\n5 added.\n\nResult becomes [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if list1 is empty, then just process list2, adding all unique elements in order.\n\nSame if list2 is empty, process list1.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nI can initialize an empty list, result, and a set, seen.\n\nThen loop through each element in list1:\n\nfor num in list1:\n    if num not in seen:\n        seen.add(num)\n        result.append(num)\n\nThen, loop through each element in list2 similarly:\n\nfor num in list2:\n    if num not in seen:\n        seen.add(num)\n        result.append(num)\n\nReturn result.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo, for example, for the case where list1 is [3, 1, 2] and list2 is [4, 5, 2], the union would be [3,1,2,4,5].\n\nTesting that: process list1, the first elements are 3,1,2 added in that order. Then list2, 4 not seen, add. 5 not seen, add. 2 is already there. So result is [3,1,2,4,5].\n\nBut in the examples provided, the ordering is such that list1's elements are added in their original order, then list2's elements in theirs. So this approach maintains that.\n\nI think this implementation should satisfy the requirements.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nDefine the function:\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n\nInitialize result as empty list, seen as empty set.\n\nLoop through each num in list1:\n\n    if num not in seen:\n\n        add to result and seen.\n\nLoop through each num in list2:\n\n    if num not in seen:\n\n        add to result and seen.\n\nReturn result.\n\nYes, seems solid.\n\nLet me write it out.\n\nThen test some cases.\n\nWait, what about the third example: list1 is empty, list2 is [1,2,3], so the result is [1,2,3].\n\nAnother test where an element is duplicated in both lists, but after being added once.\n\nExample:\n\nlist1 = [1, 1, 2], list2 = [2, 3]\n\nThe union should be [1, 2, 3].\n\nProcessing list1: first 1 is added, second 1 is skipped, 2 is added. Seen contains 1,2.\n\nProcessing list2: 2 is skipped, 3 is added.\n\nSo result is [1,2,3], correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: list1 has none, list2 has all, vice versa.\n\nI think this covers all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that returns the union of two lists of integers. The union should contain each unique element from both lists, maintaining the order of their first appearance.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Initialization**: Create an empty list to store the result and a set to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list.\n2. **Processing the First List**: Iterate through each element of the first list. For each element, if it is not already in the set, add it to both the result list and the set.\n3. **Processing the Second List**: Similarly, iterate through each element of the second list. For each element, if it is not already in the set, add it to both the result list and the set.\n4. **Return the Result**: The result list now contains the union of elements from both input lists, maintaining the order of their first appearance.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is added only once and in the order they first appear in either list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    seen = set()\n    for num in list1:\n        if num not in seen:\n            seen.add(num)\n            result.append(num)\n    for num in list2:\n        if num not in seen:\n            seen.add(num)\n            result.append(num)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `result` to store the final output and a set `seen` to keep track of elements that have been added to `result`.\n- **Processing List1**: We iterate over each element in `list1`. For each element, we check if it is in `seen`. If it is not, we add it to `result` and include it in `seen` to avoid duplicates.\n- **Processing List2**: We repeat the same process for `list2`, ensuring that only new elements (those not already seen) are added to `result`.\n- **Order Maintenance**: By processing `list1` first and then `list2`, we ensure that the elements from `list1` appear in the result in their original order, followed by elements from `list2` that haven't been seen before.\n\nThis method efficiently combines the two lists into their union while maintaining the required order and avoiding duplicates.",
