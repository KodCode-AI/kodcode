  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called union_of_lists that takes two lists of integers and returns their union. Hmm, what's the union? Oh right, the union is all the elements from both lists combined, but without duplicates. So each element appears only once, even if it's in both lists.\n\nLet me think about how to do this. So for example, if list1 is [1,2,3] and list2 is [3,4,5], the union is [1,2,3,4,5]. And if there are duplicates within a single list, like [1,2,2,3], those should appear only once in the result.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all unique elements from both lists and then return them in a list. How do I collect unique elements?\n\nMaybe I can convert each list into a set, then do a union of these sets. Sets automatically handle uniqueness because they don't allow duplicates. Then, converting back to a list. That makes sense.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Create a set from list1.\n2. Create a set from list2.\n3. Do a union of these two sets.\n4. Convert the resulting set back to a list.\n5. Sort the list or not? Wait, looking at the examples. Oh, the output lists are sorted as they are. For example, the first sample returns [1,2,3,4,5]. So the order doesn't seem to matter, but I'm given the examples in this order.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the examples again. Oh in the second example, the input lists are [1,2,2,3] and [3,3,4,4,5], the output is [1,2,3,4,5]. So it's not maintaining the order, it seems to be sorted.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is in the order of the first elements followed by the second. So maybe the function is supposed to return a list in which all elements are present, but their order doesn't necessarily matter. Or maybe the order is based on their first occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are just giving the output in the most straightforward way, but it's not a strict order. Since union is a set operation, which is unordered. So when we convert the set to a list, the order is arbitrary unless we sort it.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return the elements in sorted order because in the examples, the output is sorted. Let's look:\n\nFirst example: [1,2,3,4,5] which is clearly sorted.\n\nSecond example: inputs are [1,2,2,3], [3,3,4,4,5], so the output is [1,2,3,4,5], sorted.\n\nThird example: input [1,2,3], output is [1,2,3], sorted.\n\nFourth example when one list is empty. So it seems that the output is a sorted list.\n\nSo maybe the function is supposed to return a sorted list of the union. That changes things because simply converting a set to a list gives an arbitrary order.\n\nSo the steps should be:\n\n1. Create a set containing all elements from both lists.\n2. Convert this set to a list.\n3. Sort the list.\n4. Return it.\n\nWait, but for the second example, were the elements in any particular order? Let me see the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\nInput list1: [1, 2, 2, 3]\nInput list2: [3, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nOutput: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nSo yes, it's a sorted list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function output should be a list containing all unique elements, but in the order of their first occurrence in the combined list. Wait, but the examples don't show that. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps the output is simply all the unique elements, and the order may not be specified. Wait, looking at the sample outputs, all are sorted. So perhaps the function is intended to return the union as a sorted list.\n\nSo I need to consider that. So, the function can be implemented by combining the two lists, creating a set to eliminate duplicates, and then returning a sorted list of that set.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nSo in Python code:\n\n- Combine list1 and list2 into a single list. This can be done by list1 + list2.\n- Then create a set of this combined list to eliminate duplicates.\n- Convert the set to a sorted list.\n\nWait, but if I do that, what about the initial approach: using sets for both lists, then combining with a union, then sorting.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a set for all unique elements by taking the union of the two sets.\n\nBut in code, perhaps this is the way:\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1, list2):\n    combined = list1 + list2\n    unique_elements = set(combined)\n    result = sorted(unique_elements)\n    return result\n\nWait, does this work for the examples?\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nlist1 = [1,2,3], list2 = [3,4,5]\ncombined is [1,2,3,3,4,5]\nset of this is {1,2,3,4,5}, sorted is [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nlist1 = [1,2,2,3], list2 = [3,3,4,4,5]. Combined is [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5]\nSet is {1,2,3,4,5}, sorted as [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nThird sample: list2 is [1,2,3], list1 is empty. So combined is [1,2,3], set is the same, sorted is [1,2,3]. Correct.\n\nFourth sample: same as third.\n\nWhat if the input has elements out of order? Like list1 = [3,2,1], list2 = [4]. Then the combined list is [3,2,1,4]. The set is {1,2,3,4}, sorted becomes [1,2,3,4]. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, this approach is combining the lists, making a set, then sorting. Are there any cases where this would fail? What if the lists themselves have elements that are in different orders but contribute to the same set.\n\nBut no, because the set already captures all elements, regardless of where they are.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement, the function is supposed to have a return type of List[int]. But in Python, the sorted function returns a list, so the return is correct.\n\nTesting all the sample cases should pass.\n\nSo writing the function as:\n\nCreate a combined list of list1 and list2, then make the set, then sort it.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    combined = list1 + list2\n    unique = set(combined)\n    return sorted(unique)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, in the second case, the output is [1,2,3,4,5], which is what this would produce.\n\nOkay, that should handle all the cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the union of two lists of integers. The union of two lists is a list that contains all unique elements from both lists, sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Combine the Lists**: Concatenate the two input lists into a single list.\n2. **Remove Duplicates**: Convert the combined list into a set to automatically remove any duplicate elements, as sets only allow unique elements.\n3. **Sort the Elements**: Convert the set back into a list and sort it to ensure the elements are in ascending order.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list of unique elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles duplicates by leveraging the properties of sets and ensures the result is in a sorted order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef union_of_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    combined = list1 + list2\n    unique_elements = set(combined)\n    return sorted(unique_elements)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Combine the Lists**: The function starts by concatenating `list1` and `list2` into a single list called `combined`. This combined list includes all elements from both input lists, including duplicates.\n2. **Remove Duplicates**: The combined list is then converted into a set called `unique_elements`. This set automatically removes any duplicate values, ensuring each element is unique.\n3. **Sort the Elements**: The set of unique elements is converted back into a list using `sorted()`, which also sorts the elements in ascending order.\n4. **Return the Result**: The sorted list of unique elements is returned as the final result.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the union of two lists and ensures the result is both unique and sorted.",
