  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called remove_duplicates that takes a list and returns a new list with duplicates removed, but the order should stay the same. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nWait, so the input list can have elements that are either integers or strings. So my function needs to handle different types, but I guess that doesn't complicate things too much since I can check for their existence in some way.\n\nThe main idea is to go through each element in the input list and add it to the output list only if it hasn't been added before. So I need a way to keep track of the elements we've already seen.\n\nI remember that in Python, sets are great for tracking unique elements because they can't have duplicates. So maybe I can use a set to keep the elements that have been added. But wait, if I use a set, the order isn't preserved. Oh right, but the problem says I need to preserve the original order. So I can't just rely on the set alone; I also need to process the list in order and check each element as I go.\n\nSo here's the plan: Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen elements and an empty list to build the result. Then, iterate over each element in the input list. For each element, check if it's not already in the seen set. If it's not there, add it to both the result list and the seen set. That way, the first occurrence is kept and duplicates are skipped.\n\nBut wait, wait. What about elements that are the same value but different types? Like 1 and '1'\u2014would those be considered the same? Looking back at the examples, I see that in the test cases, [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], so it treats 2 and '2' as different. So my function should not consider 1 and '1' as duplicates. So the elements are checked for equality as per Python's equality checking. Which I think is correct.\n\nSo, for each element in the input list:\n\n1. If it's not in the seen set:\n   - Append it to the result list.\n   - Add it to the seen set.\n2. If it is in the seen set:\n   - Skip it.\n\nThat should handle everything correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about the test cases:\n\nTest case 1: empty list. The function should return an empty list. Easy, since the loops won't run.\n\nTest case 2: single element, returns the same.\n\nTest case 3: multiple elements with duplicates in structure given. It should de-duplicate.\n\nSo, looking at the example:\n\nremove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Because 2 appears twice, so the second 2 is skipped. Similarly for 4.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nSo, I'll write:\n\nCreate a variable, say seen = set()\n\nCreate an empty list, result = []\n\nThen, for element in input_list:\n\n   if element not in seen:\n\n       add to result\n\n       add to seen\n\nBut wait, wait a second. What about the order of insertion? Because the first occurrence is added, so the result list will have the elements in the order of their first occurrence. That's correct.\n\nWhat about elements that are the same but in different cases, like 'a' and 'A'? Since in Python 'a' != 'A'. So no problem, but the function correctly treats them as separate.\n\nSo, the code structure is straightforward.\n\nSo the function could be written as:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for element in input_list:\n        if element not in seen:\n            result.append(element)\n            seen.add(element)\n    return result\n\nThat seems simple enough.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nExample 1: input is [], output is []. Correct.\n\nExample 2: input [1], output [1]. Correct.\n\nExample 3: input [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about a case with mixed types, but same structure, like [1, '1', 1]? The function should return [1, '1'], because 1 is added again in the third position, but since it was already in the set, it's skipped.\n\nYes. So in this case, 1 and '1' are considered different and both are included.\n\nIs there any other edge case I can think of? How about if the list is very large, or elements are large objects? But since the function only appends if not seen, and uses a set for lookups, which are O(1), it's efficient.\n\nWait, but what about unhashable types? Wait, no: The function's parameter is List[Union[int, str]]. Both int and str are hashable, so the elements can be added to the set without issues.\n\nSo, this function should work as intended.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove duplicates from a given list while preserving the original order of elements. The input list can contain integers or strings, and each element should appear only once in the resulting list, maintaining their first occurrence order.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using a set to keep track of elements we have already seen as we iterate through the list. By leveraging the properties of sets, which provide average O(1) time complexity for membership checks and insertions, we can efficiently determine whether an element has already been added to the result list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n1. **Initialize a Set and a Result List**: We start by initializing an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the elements we have encountered. We also initialize an empty list called `result` to build our output.\n2. **Iterate Through the Input List**: For each element in the input list, we check if it is present in the `seen` set.\n3. **Check and Add Elements**: If the element is not in the `seen` set, we add it to both the `result` list and the `seen` set. If it is already in the set, we simply skip it.\n4. **Return the Result List**: After processing all elements, we return the `result` list which contains the elements in their original order without duplicates.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed exactly once, resulting in an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for element in input_list:\n        if element not in seen:\n            result.append(element)\n            seen.add(element)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Set for Tracking Seen Elements**: The set `seen` is used to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list. This allows us to quickly check for duplicates in constant time.\n- **Result List Construction**: The `result` list is built by iterating over each element of the input list and adding elements to it only if they are not already in the `seen` set. This ensures that the order of elements is preserved as per their first occurrence.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the problem of removing duplicates while maintaining the original order, making it suitable for lists of various sizes and compositions.",
