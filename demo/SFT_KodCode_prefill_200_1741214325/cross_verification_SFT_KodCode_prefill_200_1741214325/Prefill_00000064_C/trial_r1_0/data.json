  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers or strings and returns a new list where duplicates are removed, but the original order is preserved. Hmm, so how do I do this?\n\nLet me think about examples. If the input is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the output should be [1,2,3,4,5]. And for an empty list, it should return empty. Also, a single element list should remain the same.\n\nSo the main goal is to process each element in order and only include it once, even if it appears multiple times. But what's the best way to track which elements we've already seen?\n\nMaybe I can use a helper data structure, like a set, to keep track of elements that have been added. Since sets have O(1) lookups, that would be efficient. Then, as I iterate through each item in the input list, I check if it's in the set. If it's not, I add it to the result list and also add it to the set. If it is, I skip it.\n\nWait, but the list can contain elements of any hashable type, like integers and strings, so they can be added to a set. That should be fine.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.\n2. Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen elements.\n3. Iterate through each element in the input list:\n   a. If the element is not in the set:\n      i. Add it to the set.\n      ii. Append it to the result list.\n   b. Else, do nothing.\n4. Return the result list.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? Since we're iterating in order and only adding elements the first time they appear, the order should naturally be preserved.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in Python, if the list is large, using a list and a set could be efficient enough. Sets have average O(1) membership checks and add operations.\n\nBut what about unhashable types? The function says the input list contains integers or strings, which are hashable, so that's okay.\n\nLet me think about the code structure. The function is defined with input_list as a List of Union[int, str]. So the function signature is given.\n\nI'll start by initializing the result list and the seen set. Then loop through each item.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            seen.add(item)\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n\nWait, but I remember that in some cases, the initial seen might not capture elements correctly, but in this loop, it should work.\n\nLet me test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input_list = []\nResult would be []. That should be correct.\n\nSample 2: [1] \u2192 loop runs once, adds 1 to seen and result, returns [1]. Correct.\n\nSample 3: [1,2,2,3,4,4,5]. The loop will process 1, add to set, add to result. Then 2, same. Next 2 is skipped. Then 3 added, etc. So the result would be [1,2,3,4,5]. Which matches the sample.\n\nWhat about if the list has multiple duplicates in different orders, like [1,2,1,3] \u2192 should become [1,2,3].\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5], should result in [5].\n\nWhat about a mix of data types, like [1, '1', 1]? Since 1 and '1' are different in Python, the output should be [1, '1']. But wait, if the input is [1, '1', 1], the function will treat 1 and '1' as different because their types are different. So the code handles that correctly.\n\nWait, in the function, the set uses the equality of the elements. So if two elements are different in terms of value or type, they are considered different.\n\nSo the code should handle that case correctly.\n\nI think this logic should cover all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order of the elements. The function should handle a list containing integers or strings and return a new list with each element appearing only once.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using two main data structures: a list to store the result and a set to keep track of the elements we have already encountered. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Create an empty list (`result`) to store the output and an empty set (`seen`) to keep track of elements that have been added to the result list.\n2. **Iterate Through Input List**: For each element in the input list, check if it is present in the `seen` set.\n3. **Check and Add Elements**: If the element is not in the `seen` set, add it to both the `seen` set and the `result` list. If the element is already in the `seen` set, skip it.\n4. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return the `result` list which contains the elements in their original order without duplicates.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed in order and only added once, maintaining the original order and efficiently removing duplicates using the properties of sets for quick lookups.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            seen.add(item)\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The `seen` set is used to track elements that have already been added to the result, ensuring no duplicates are included.\n- **Iteration and Check**: As we iterate over each element in the input list, we use the set to check if the element has been encountered before. This check is efficient due to the average O(1) complexity for set membership operations.\n- **Adding Elements**: If an element is not found in the set, it is added to both the set and the result list. This ensures that the result list maintains the order of the first occurrence of each element.\n- **Efficiency**: The use of a set ensures that the solution is efficient, with an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage requirements for the set and the result list.\n\nThis approach effectively handles various cases, including empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with multiple duplicates, ensuring the correct output in each scenario.",
