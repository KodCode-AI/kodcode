  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to write a Python function called remove_duplicates that takes a list of integers or strings and returns a new list with the duplicates removed, while preserving the original order. Okay, so the examples provided show that for an empty list, it returns empty. For a single element, it returns the same element. And for a list with duplicates like [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], it returns [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nHmm, so the key things here are to remove duplicates and preserve the order. So the first thought is, how do I check for elements that have appeared before without using extra data structures? Because if I use a set, like the typical approach, that would let me know about duplicates but sets in Python are unordered, so adding to the new list based on that might not preserve the order if I rebuild later. Or wait, maybe using a set in combination with the list can help.\n\nLet me think. I can create an empty set to keep track of elements I've already added to the new list. Then, iterate through each element in the input list. For each element, if it's not in the set, add it to both the new list and the set. That way, duplicates are skipped. Because we're going in order, this should preserve the original order, adding each element the first time it appears and ignoring subsequent duplicates.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for the sample input [1,2,2,3,4,4,5], the function would loop through each element. 1 is not in the set, so add to new list and add to the set. 2 is not in the set, add it. Next 2 is in the set, skip. Then 3 is not in the set, add. 4 is not in the set initially, then next 4 is skipped, etc.\n\nSo for the code structure, I'll initialize an empty set called seen and an empty list called result. Then, for each item in input_list:\n    if item not in seen:\n        add to result\n        add item to seen\nFinally, return result.\n\nThat should do it.\n\nWait, what about cases where data types are mixed? But the function is supposed to handle both int and str, so checking with 'in' should still work since the data types are same when they are duplicates. For example, if the list contains 1 and '1', which are different in Python, they should be treated as separate elements, which is correct.\n\nTesting another case: [1, '1', 1], should return [1, '1'], which correctly removes the last 1 but leaves the string.\n\nWhat about unhashable types? Wait, in Python, for a set, the elements must be hashable. So since the function accepts only int and str, which are both hashable, this shouldn't be a problem. So elements like [1, [2], 3], but since the function's input is restricted to int and str, that's fine.\n\nHence, this approach should work.\n\nNow, in code:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            result.append(item)\n            seen.add(item)\n    return result\n\nYes, that should handle all the cases. Let me see if I need to handle any edge cases. What about empty list, which is handled as seen is empty, so no items added. Single elements are handled as expected.\n\nWait, for the type annotations, I need to make sure that the code has the correct annotations. The function argument is annotated as List[Union[int, str]], which should be correct.\n\nNow, thinking about performance. For each element in input_list, checking if it's in the set is O(1) average case, so the overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient. The space complexity is also O(n), which is necessary since we're storing the unique elements.\n\nIs there any way this can be improved? Maybe using a different data structure, but for the problem constraints, this approach is simple and efficient.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest case 1: remove_duplicates([]) returns []\nYes, because the loop doesn't run.\n\nTest case 2: remove_duplicates([1]) returns [1]\nYes, correctly added.\n\nTest case 3: remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]) returns [1,2,3,4,5], correct.\n\nAnother test case with mixed types: like [1, '1', 1, '1'] should return [1, '1'].\n\nWait, testing that:\n\nLoop:\n1 not in seen? Yes, add to result and seen.\nThen '1' not in seen? Well, since seen contains 1, '1' is a different item, so it's added. So 1 and '1' are treated as different elements, which is correct.\n\nHence, the code handles that.\n\nI think that's a solid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that removes duplicates from a list while preserving the original order. The function should handle a list containing integers and strings and return a new list with each element appearing only once in the order they first appear.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a set to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Create an empty set called `seen` to track elements that have been added and an empty list called `result` to store the output.\n2. **Iterate Through Input List**: For each element in the input list, check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n3. **Add Element if Not Seen**: If the element is not in `seen`, add it to both the `result` list and the `seen` set.\n4. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return the `result` list.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is processed in O(1) average time complexity for membership checks in the set, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the `seen` set and the `result` list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef remove_duplicates(input_list: List[Union[int, str]]) -> List[Union[int, str]]:\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen:\n            result.append(item)\n            seen.add(item)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Set for Tracking**: The `seen` set efficiently tracks which elements have already been added to the result list, ensuring no duplicates are included.\n- **List for Order Preservation**: The `result` list maintains the order of elements as they first appear, which is crucial for preserving the original order.\n- **Efficiency**: By leveraging the O(1) average time complexity for set operations, the function efficiently handles the input list, even for larger datasets.\n\nThis solution is optimal for the given problem constraints and ensures that the output list contains unique elements in their original order of appearance.",
