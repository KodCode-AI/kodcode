  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a bubble sort function in Python that takes a list of integers and returns the sorted list. Let's recall what bubble sort does. It's a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to implement this. So, the main idea is to have a loop that runs until no more swaps are needed, which indicates the list is sorted. Alternatively, I can use nested loops where the outer loop runs for each element and the inner loop compares and swaps adjacent elements.\n\nWait, right, the basic approach is to have a nested loop structure. The outer loop will iterate for each pass through the list. The inner loop will compare each pair of adjacent elements and swap them if necessary.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Make a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original, or maybe it's okay if we modify it; since the problem requires returning the sorted list, perhaps it's okay. Hmm, but in Python, the function is given a list, so if we modify it, the original outside might change. Wait, but wait, the function is passed arr, and returns arr, so in the examples, it seems that inside the function, we can work in-place. But wait, looking at the doctests, the function is called with certain lists and returns the sorted list. So perhaps in-place modification is acceptable, but after the function is done, the original arr outside would be modified if we don't create a copy. But perhaps for this problem, since the function is to return the sorted list, making a copy is not necessary as each function call is separate. Or perhaps I can just proceed with in-place because the function is only called once each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can make a copy to be safe. But for now, let's proceed; I can change the approach if needed.\n\nSo back to the steps:\n\n- Loop through the array multiple times until no swaps occur.\nAlternatively, use len(arr) - 1 passes, each time the largest unsorted element \"bubbles\" to its correct position.\n\nWait, the inner loop for each pass can be optimized by noting that after each pass, the last i elements are in place, so the next pass doesn't need to go all the way to the end. So perhaps in the outer loop, the number of passes is len(arr), and in the inner loop, it loops up to len(arr) - 1 - (pass number), or something like that.\n\nYes, that's a more efficient approach. So for each i in range(0, len(arr)-1), the inner loop would run from 0 to len(arr)-i-2, perhaps. Wait, for i in range(len(arr)), for each pass, starting from 0 up to len(arr)-1, which is the number of elements minus one.\n\nWait, no\u2014the standard outer loop is for i in range(len(arr)-1):. Then, in each inner loop, j runs from 0 to len(arr)-2, but maybe adjusting for each pass.\n\nAlternatively, the more efficient way is to have the outer loop run for n-1 times, and the inner loop runs from 0 to n-2-i for each i.\n\nNo, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let's think: in each pass, the ith largest element is placed in its correct position. So the first pass places the last element correctly, the second pass places the second last correctly, etc. So for each i in 0 to n-2, for the ith pass, the j in the inner loop goes from 0 to n-2 -i.\n\nWait, example: for an array of size 5.\n\nFirst pass (i=0): j goes 0 to 3. Because after first pass, the last element is in place, so the next pass can go up to j=2 (n-2 -1 = 2).\n\nHmm, maybe it's more accurate to say that for each pass, the inner loop can ignore the last i elements because they are already sorted.\n\nSo, perhaps the outer loop can be for i in range(len(arr)-1), and the inner loop runs from j=0 to (len(arr)-1 - i) -1, i.e., len(arr)-2 -i. Wait, or maybe j goes up to len(arr)-i-2, since the last i elements are already in place.\n\nWait, let's try for a small array:\n\nTake [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90].\n\nPass 0: j goes from 0 to 6-0-1 = 5? Because it's a list of 7 elements. So in the inner loop, j will be 0 to 5-1, which is 5-1=4? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the indices up to which we compare. For a pass, we compare j and j+1 up to j = len(arr) - i - 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to have each pass go from 0 to len(arr)-i-2.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each i from 0 to len(arr)-1:\n\n   for j in 0 to len(arr)-1 - i -1:\n\n      if arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap.\n\nSo for the first pass (i=0), j runs from 0 to len(arr)-i-2, which is for 7 elements, 0 to 4 (since 7 -0 -2 =5? Because in zero-based indices, for a 7-element array, the last index is 6. So for j, in each iteration, j+1 is <=6).\n\nWait, for j in range(len(arr)-1-i): because in each pass i, the last i elements are in their place. So for the first pass, j runs from 0 to len(arr)-2 (since j+1 must be <= len(arr)-1). Wait, perhaps the inner loop is for j in range(len(arr) -1 -i):  that is, for a pass i, we have to swap elements for j from 0 to (len(arr)-2 -i). Let's see:\n\nIn the first pass (i=0), we run j from 0 to 5 (since len(arr)-1 -0=6, and j ranges up to 5, so j+1 is 6). Wait, if len(arr) is 7, then len(arr)-1 is 6. So in the first pass, the inner loop j goes from 0 to 5.\n\nThat's correct, because after the first pass, the largest element is at the end. Then in the second pass, j goes from 0 to 4, because the second largest is now at position 5, so no need to check it again.\n\nYes, this makes sense. So in code, the outer loop can run for i in range(len(arr)-1), and the inner loop runs for j in range(0, len(arr)-i-1). Wait, because inside the inner loop, j+1 should be less than len(arr)-i.\n\nWait, because for the pass i, the elements after position len(arr)-i-1 are already sorted.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(n - i -1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n\nWait, no: j in range(n - i -1) would only loop up to n-i-2, because in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound. Let me test:\n\nIf n is 7, for i=0: inner loop j runs from 0 to 5 (because 7 -0 -1 =6; j's in 0 to5 (0<=j<6). Because in Python, range(6) is 0-5. Yes. So then in each iteration, j and j+1 are checked.\n\nSo the code nested loops would be:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(n - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\nWait, no. Let's see, the range for the inner loop is j in 0..(n-i-2), because inner loop is for j in range(n -i -1): which in Python, is 0..(n-i-2) since for example, range(3) is 0,1,2.\n\nWait, for example, when n=7, i=0: n-i-1 is 6. So j will range from 0 to 5 (0-5), which is correct. For i=1, n-i-1 is 5, so j runs 0-4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each i, the last i elements are correctly placed, so in the inner loop, we only go up to n - i - 1, which is the index before the last i elements.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: for a pass i, during the i-th iteration (0-based), we process elements from 0 up to (n -2 -i). Because for each such i, the (i+1)th largest element will bubble to the end.\n\nSo, for a 7-element array:\n\ni=0: inner loop j runs 0-5. After this, the largest element is at index 6.\ni=1: inner loop j runs 0-4. After this, the second largest is at index5.\ni=2: inner loop j runs 0-3. So in each pass, the part being processed is the unsorted portion of the array.\n\nSo the outer loop should run for i from 0 to n-2, as for a 7-element array, it runs 6 times (i=0 to 5).\n\nWait, wait, wait\u2014this would suggest that the outer loop is for i in range(n-1), which for n=7, gives i from0 to5 (6 iterations), which is correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    for j in range(n - i -1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\nAlternatively, I could use the swapped flag for optimization, so that if a pass results in no swaps, the list is already sorted and we can break early.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement, the sample test cases don't seem to require optimized code. So perhaps including the swapped optimization would be better for efficiency.\n\nWait, adding the swapped flag is a good idea because if the list is already sorted, the function can exit early instead of making unnecessary passes. So, maybe I can implement that.\n\nSo the plan with swapped flag:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    swapped = False\n    for j in range(n - i -1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            swapped = True\n    if not swapped:\n        break\n\nWait, but wait, even if a single swap occurs in the inner loop, the swapped flag is set to True, and we go to the next pass. If in that next pass, no swaps, we break. Correct.\n\nYes, that's more efficient.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBut first, perhaps I should also handle the case when the list is empty or has a single element. Looking at the test cases, the function should handle arr=[] or [5] correctly.\n\nWait, in the case when arr is empty, the outer loop won't run (n-1 = -1, but in Python, range(-1) is empty, so the function returns the same empty list. For arr of size 1, same thing\u2014outer loop runs 0 times, return the same.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nThe expected output is [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]. Let's see the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the code as written correctly implements the bubble sort.\n\nSo writing the function:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\nWait, wait\u2014that's not handling the cases correctly. Wait, for the second test case: [-2, -34, -60, -1, -50] expected output is [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1]. Let's see:\n\nWith the code as written, in each pass, the largest unsorted element is moved to the end.\n\nPass 0 (i=0):\n\nj runs from 0 to 3 (since n=5, 5-0-1=4, so j runs from 0 to3 inclusive? Wait, 5-0-1=4, so for j in range(4), j is 0,1,2,3. Because in range(4), j<4.\n\nBut the next element is j+1, which for j=3, is 4\u2014so in each step:\n\nCompare a[0] and a[1] (-2 and -34): since -2 > -34, swap. So after first j=0, the array becomes [-34, -2, -60, -1, -50].\n\nContinue for j=1: compare -2 and -60. -2 > -60: swap. Now array is [-34, -60, -2, -1, -50].\n\nj=2: compare -2 and -1: -2 < -1, no swap.\n\nj=3: compare -1 and -50: since -1 > -50? No, -1 is larger than -50. So -1 is 1 is more, so swap. Array becomes [-34, -60, -2, -50, -1].\n\nSo after first pass, the largest remaining element (-1) is at the end. But the array becomes correctly placed as such?\n\nWait, wait, no. Because in the array after j=3 swap:\n\nOriginal array before this pass is [-2, -34, -60, -1, -50]. After j=0: swap -2 and-34 \u2192 [-34, -2, \u2026], then j=1, swap -2 and -60 \u2192 [-34, -60, -2, \u2026], then j=2: no swap (since -2 < -1?), j=3: arr[3] is -1, arr[4] is -50 \u2192 since -1 >-50, so swap \u2192 arr becomes [-34, -60, -2, -50, -1].\n\nWait, but the correctly sorted list after pass 0 would have -1 as the last element. So yes. So move to next pass.\n\nIn pass i=1, the inner loop runs j from 0 to 2 (since 5-1-1=3, so range(3) is j=0,1,2.\n\nBut in this inner loop, during this pass, anything else is compared correctly.\n\nWait, but I don't think the code handles duplicates correctly, but in this case, there are no duplicates. So the code should proceed.\n\nAnother test case is [5], which should return [5]. The code handles it as len(arr) is 1, so range(0) is nothing. The function returns [5].\n\nAnother test case is [4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4], which should return [1,2,2,3,4,4]. Let's see:\n\nThe code should sort this correctly with several passes.\n\nSo it looks like the code should handle all test cases.\n\nNow, wait\u2014did I account for the type? The function signature is arr: List[int]. So perhaps since we're in Python, and lists are mutable, the function will modify the original list, but in the test cases, the function is called, and it's expected to return the sorted list.\n\nWait, in the first test case, 64,34,... becomes [11,...], the code would modify it correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo why are the sample test cases correct? Because in the function, the original arr is modified and then returned.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are mutable. So if arr is passed as a parameter and modified in the function, the original list outside would also be modified. Wait, for example:\n\na = [3,2,1]\nbubble_sort(a)\nprint(a) \u2192 will this print sorted list?\n\nYes.\n\nBut the function is supposed to return the sorted list, regardless of whether it's a copy or in-place. Since the test cases are expecting a return value, it's fine.\n\nSo the code as written should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The function is defined as:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n\nAnd the code inside is modifying arr and returning it.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case is [-2,34,-60,12,-50,72], which should return [-60,-50,-2, 12,34,72]\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe bubble sort code would correctly handle the negatives.\n\nFirst, the list is [-2,34,-60,12,-50,72].\n\nn=6.\n\ni=0:\n\ninner loop j runs to 4 (6-0-1=5; j runs from 0-4).\n\nCompare j=0: -2 and 34 \u2192 no swap.\nj=1:34 and -60 \u2192 34> -60 \u2192 swap \u2192 list becomes [-2,-60,34,12,-50,72]\n\nj=2: 34 and 12 \u2192 swap \u2192 list becomes [-2,-60,12,34,-50,72]\n\nj=3:34 and -50 \u2192 swap \u2192 list becomes [-2,-60,12,-50, 34,72]\n\nj=4: 34 and 72 \u2192 no swap.\n\nSo after this pass, the last element is 72, which is correctly placed.\n\nThen, in i=1, the inner loop j runs from 0 to 3.\n\nIn this pass:\n\nj=0: compare -2 and -60 \u2192 -2 >-60 \u2192 swap \u2192 [-60, -2,12,-50,34,72]\n\nj=1: -2 and 12 \u2192 no swap.\n\nj=2:12 and -50 \u2192 yes, swap \u2192 becomes [-60,-2, -50,12,34,72]\n\nj=3:12 and 34 \u2192 no swap.\n\nafter this, the swapped flag is True, because some swaps occurred.\n\nNext pass i=2.\n\nj runs from 0 to 2:\n\nElements: -60, -2, -50,12,34,72\n\nj=0: compare -60 and -2 \u2192 no swap.\n\nj=1: -2 and -50 \u2192 -2 > -50 \u2192 swap \u2192 becomes -60,-50,-2,12,34,72\n\nj=2: -2 and 12 \u2192 no swap.\n\nso swapped is True.\n\ni increases to 3.\n\nj runs from 0 to 1.\n\narray: [-60,-50,-2,12,34,72]\n\nj=0: -60 vs -50 \u2192 no swap.\n\nj=1: -50 vs -2 \u2192 yes, swap \u2192 becomes [-60, -2, -50, 12, 34,72].\n\nswap is True.\n\ni increases to4.\n\nj runs from 0 to 0.\n\narray:[-60,-2,-50,12,34,72]\n\nj=0: compare -60 and -2 \u2192 no swap.\n\nswapped remains False.\n\nSo after this pass, since no swaps were done, the break occurs.\n\nThe function returns the array, which is [-60, -2, -50, 12, 34,72]? No, wait, wait: wait after pass i=2, the array is [-60,-50,-2,12,34,72]. Then in pass i=3, the j loop runs from 0 to len(arr)-i-1=6-3-1=2, so j from 0 to2-1=1?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up in the loop logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample test cases are handled.\n\nIn any case, according to the test cases given, the function should work.\n\nNow, perhaps writing the code as above, and testing.\n\nWait, but looking back, the code I wrote earlier is exactly that.\n\nSo the function is written correctly.\n\nWait a slight moment: in the code I wrote, j loops for range(n - i - 1). But the maximum j is (n - i -1 -1), because in Python, range is exclusive.\n\nWait, for example, when i=0, n=5, arr has 5 elements. So j runs from 0 to 3 (since 5-0-1=4 \u2192 j in 0,1,2,3). Because j has to be less than 4. So j+1 is 4, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the code is correct.\n\nAnother way is to implement without the swapped flag for optimization, but the code above includes the optimization, which is more efficient.\n\nSo the final code should look like that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\nThe bubble sort algorithm works by making multiple passes through the list. In each pass, the largest unsorted element is \"bubbled\" to the end of the list. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is fully sorted.\n\nKey steps in the approach:\n1. **Outer Loop**: This loop runs for each element in the list, ensuring that each element is placed in its correct position.\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each pass of the outer loop, the inner loop runs through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements. If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped.\n3. **Early Termination**: If a pass through the list results in no swaps, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early for efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the list. This ensures that each element is placed in its correct position.\n- **Inner Loop**: For each pass `i`, the inner loop runs from the start of the list to the point where the largest unsorted element will be placed. This is calculated as `n - i - 1` to avoid rechecking already sorted elements.\n- **Swapping**: If adjacent elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped, and a flag `swapped` is set to `True`.\n- **Early Termination**: If no swaps occur during a pass, the list is sorted, and the algorithm breaks out of the loop early for efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted in O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case, with improvements due to early termination when the list becomes sorted.",
