  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a bubble sort function in Python. Wait, bubble sort is that algorithm where you repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they're in the wrong order. Yeah, right. So I guess I'll need to implement that.\n\nHmm, the function is called bubble_sort and takes an array of integers. Oh, and it returns the sorted array. So I should modify a copy of the input array and return it.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. I remember that bubble sort has nested loops. The outer loop runs for each pass through the array, and the inner loop does the comparing and swapping.\n\nWait, wait. How does the outer loop work? I think it runs for n-1 passes, where n is the length of the array. Because after each pass, the largest element bubbles up to its correct position. So for each pass, the elements from the start up to the nth position are checked.\n\nWait, more concretely, suppose the array has 7 elements. Then in the first pass, the 7th element is in place. Then the second pass, the 6th is in place, etc. So for each pass i, we go from 0 to (n - i - 1) maybe? Or is it slightly different.\n\nWait, let's say for each i in range(len(arr)-1), because each pass i places the i-th largest element in place. So, the number of passes can be up to len(arr)-1, but in practice, you can stop early if the array becomes sorted without needing all passes.\n\nWait, but for now, maybe implement it without optimization. Just do all passes.\n\nSo the outer loop would be for i in range(len(arr)), but wait, maybe len(arr)-1 times, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'll try a simple example. Let's take [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]. The sorted array should be [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90].\n\nHow many passes does bubble sort make? For 7 elements, I think 7-1=6 passes.\n\nWait, first pass: compare 64 and 34, swap \u2192 34,64. Then 64 and 25 \u2192 swap \u2192 25,64? No, wait. Let me see.\n\nWait the first pass through the array would compare every adjacent pairs and swap if they are in the wrong order. Each time, the largest unsorted element will bubble up to the end.\n\nWait, actually, each pass puts the next largest element into its correct position. So after the first pass, the last element is correct. After the second, the second last, etc.\n\nSo the outer loop should iterate from 0 to len(arr) - 1. Then in each iteration, the inner loop processes each pair except the already sorted part.\n\nSo in the first iteration i=0, the inner loop goes from 0 to len(arr) - 2 - i (since in first pass, we go up to len-1 - 0 -1 = len-2).\n\nWait, maybe the inner loop runs for j in range(0, len(arr) - i -1). That way, after i passes, the last i elements are correctly placed and don't need to be checked in the next passes.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because after each i, we have i elements sorted at the end.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n\nSo yes, that's the structure.\n\nWait, but in Python, how to swap. Oh, can just use a temporary variable, or use tuple unpacking.\n\nLike, arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nWait, then, for the sample inputs, let's see. For [64,34,...90], the first pass should push 90 to the end.\n\nBut perhaps I should test another case.\n\nWhat about the second sample, [-2, -34, -60, -1, -50]. The sorted output should be [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1].\n\nSo during the first pass, each adjacent pair in this array is checked.\n\n- Compare -2 and -34: -2 > -34 \u2192 swap \u2192 becomes [-34, -2, -60, -1, -50]\n\nWait no, wait the initial array is [-2, -34, -60, -1, -50]. Let's track each pass.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the algorithm.\n\nWait, another thing to consider: Sometimes, after a certain pass, the array might already be sorted, so we can break early.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, in this initial implementation, we can leave that optimization out unless it's easy to add.\n\nSo maybe after the code is written without it, think about adding it. But since the problem requires writing the function with those test cases, perhaps the optimization isn't necessary.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to include it, because for large arrays, it can save time.\n\nWait, but looking at the test cases, none of them are too large. But perhaps for correctness, it's optional.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort\n    swapped = False\n    for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            # Swap them\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            swapped = True\n    # If no two elements were swapped in inner loop, the array is sorted.\n    if not swapped:\n        break\n\nSo wait, that will make the algorithm more efficient by stopping early.\n\nSo that's a good idea.\n\nSo now, the function should correctly implement bubble sort.\n\nBut then, what about the edge cases? Like when the array is empty, the function should return empty. If the array has one element, it's already sorted.\n\nThe test cases include all these.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWait, but what about modifying the array passed in? Oh, wait, in the test cases, for example:\n\nbubble_sort([64, 34, ...90]) \u2192 [11, 12,...90]. So the function modifies a copy of the array or not?\n\nWait, in the code as written so far, we modify the array in place. But in Python, lists are mutable and the function might modify the original. But looking at the test cases, perhaps the function is allowed to modify the input, as the test cases seem to be assigning the return value.\n\nWait, but in the test cases, the [4,2,1,2,3,4] returns [1,2,2,3,4,4]. So the function replaces the original by a sorted version.\n\nWait, but the code as written modifies the input array in place. But I'm wondering whether the function should create a copy first to avoid modifying the input array.\n\nHmm. Because in the test cases, the inputs don't get modified since they're passed as literals. But in general, if the function is called with a list, it will modify it, which might not be desired.\n\nSo perhaps the function should make a copy of the input array and sort that, leaving the original unchanged.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.\n\nSo in the code, the first thing is to make a copy of the input array.\n\nLike, arr = arr.copy()\n\nWait, but in the function signature, the input is List[int]. So in Python, I can create a new list.\n\nSo:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Make a copy to avoid modifying the original list\n    arr = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                # Swap elements\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\nWait, but wait, what about when the array is empty? Adding the copy should handle it because an empty list's copy is also empty.\n\nSame for single elements.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nTest 1: bubble_sort([64,34,25,12,22,11,90]) \u2192 should return sorted list. Let's see.\n\nBut the code will loop 6 times because 7 elements. Yeah, but if in one of the passes, swapped is False, it breaks.\n\nSo, for the first pass in this example, each step will swap until the current maximum is at the end.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nAnother test case is the one with duplicates: [4,2,1,2,3,4] becomes [1,2,2,3,4,4]. So the code should correctly handle duplicates.\n\nLet's see in the code.\n\nYes, because the swapping takes place when arr[j] > arr[j+1]. So in case of equal elements, no swap occurs, which is correct.\n\nWait, but what about stability? Bubble sort is a stable algorithm, right. Because equal elements are not swapped, their original order is preserved. Since the problem examples don't have such cases, but the function should still handle them correctly, which I think it does.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting it with the test cases:\n\nSample 1: the function should return [11, 12,22,25,34,64,90] which is correct.\n\nSample 2: returns [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1], correct.\n\nThird sample: [-2,34,-60,12,-50,72] \u2192 after sorting, it's [-60, -50, -2, 12, 34, 72]. Which the code should handle.\n\nThe single-element case, empty, and already sorted are also handled.\n\nSo I think this code should pass all test cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Bubble Sort Overview**: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until no swaps occur, indicating the array is fully sorted.\n2. **Optimization**: By introducing an optimization to stop early if the array becomes sorted before all passes are completed, we can improve the efficiency of the algorithm.\n3. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as an empty array, a single-element array, and arrays with duplicate values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr = arr.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                # Swap elements\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Copy the Input Array**: To avoid modifying the original input array, we first create a copy of it.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for each element in the array. Each pass of the outer loop places the next largest element in its correct position.\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each pass of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates through the unsorted portion of the array, comparing each pair of adjacent elements. If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped.\n4. **Early Termination**: If no swaps occur during an inner loop pass, the array is already sorted, and the outer loop breaks early to save time.\n\nThis approach ensures that the array is sorted efficiently, even if it becomes sorted before all possible passes are completed, thus optimizing performance.",
