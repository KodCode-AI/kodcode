  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement the bubble sort algorithm for an integer list. Hmm, Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Right, so the process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.\n\nWait, how do I structure this in Python? I remember that you usually need nested loops. The outer loop runs for each element, and the inner loop does the comparisons and swaps.\n\nLet's think about the steps. First, take the array as input. Then, for each pass from 0 to len(arr) - 1, because each pass places the next largest element at the end. Right, yeah. So in each pass, go through the array up to n-i-1 to avoid checking the already sorted part.\n\nWait, but Python lists are mutable. So I can modify the list in place. Or should I create a copy? Hmm, maybe it's better to create a copy to avoid modifying the original list outside the function. Or perhaps the function is intended to sort and return a new list, but the examples seem to show it's a sort, so probably returns a new sorted list instead of modifying the input. Hmm. Or maybe it's better to make a copy of the array to sort, so the original isn't changed.\n\nWait looking at the examples, like the first one: [64,34,25,12,22,11,90] becomes [11,12,22,25,34,64,90]. So the function doesn't modify the input, it returns a new sorted array.\n\nSo in code: I'll create a copy of the input array. So I can do something like sorted_arr = arr.copy() ? Or maybe create a list slice sorted_arr = arr[:], which does a shallow copy.\n\nYes, so in the function, first I'll make a copy.\n\nThen, I need to loop over each element for i in range(len(sorted_arr)):\n\nWait, no. Wait in bubble sort, each pass pushes the largest element to the end. So for each i in range(len(sorted_arr)-1). Wait, no, let me correct. The number of passes should be equal to the number of elements, but each subsequent pass doesn't need to go all the way because the end is already sorted.\n\nWait, no. The outer loop should run from 0 to len(sorted_arr)-1. But after each pass, the next passes can skip the last i elements. So perhaps, nested loops: the outer is for the number of passes, then the inner runs from 0 to (len - (pass number) -1).\n\nWait, perhaps better to write it as n = len(sorted_arr). For i in range(n): and then for j in range(0, n-i-1).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what about for a zero-length list or a single element? The code should handle that, but the loops might not run, which is correct.\n\nNow, in the inner loop, check if sorted_arr[j] > sorted_arr[j+1]. If yes, swap them.\n\nSo: for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n\n   if sorted_arr[j] > sorted_arr[j+1], swap.\n\nHow to swap? Maybe using a temporary variable. Or use tuple unpacking.\n\nLike, sorted_arr[j], sorted_arr[j+1] = sorted_arr[j+1], sorted_arr[j]\n\nYes, that's efficient.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    sorted_arr = arr[:]  # make a copy to avoid modifying the original\n    n = len(sorted_arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort\n        # I remember some optimized versions use this. It might save some time.\n        # But the examples here might not need it, but including it is better.\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if sorted_arr[j] > sorted_arr[j+1]:\n                # Swap\n                sorted_arr[j], sorted_arr[j+1] = sorted_arr[j+1], sorted_arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        # If no two elements were swapped in inner loop, the array is sorted.\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return sorted_arr\n\nWait, wait! So in that code, for each i from 0 to n-1. Then in j from 0 to n-i-1 - but in Python, the ending index is exclusive, so the inner loop should be for j in range(n - i - 1): should that be up to (n-i-1) ? Or is it range(0, n -i). Hmm, confusion.\n\nWait, no. Suppose for the initial pass i=0, the inner loop runs j from 0 to (n - 0 -1) -1, because the end in range is exclusive.\n\nWait no: j runs from 0 to (n -i -1) as the upper limit.\n\nSo for example, when i=0, n is len(arr). So the inner loop runs j in 0 to n-1-1. Wait wait, len(arr) is n, so the indexes go from 0 to n-1. So j needs to go up to n-2, because when j is n-2, j+1 is n-1: which is the correct last pair.\n\nWait so, for the first pass, j runs from 0 to n-2. So in the inner loop, it's for j in range(0, n - i - 1).\n\nWait no, wait in the inner loop, if i is the current pass, then the length is (n - i) because each pass i, the last i elements are in place. So the inner loop should go up to (n -i -1) as the ending index in the range function.\n\nWait, wait it's like for each pass i, you're examining the subarray [0..n-i-1], because after i elements have been bubbled to the end.\n\nSo in code, the inner loop would start at 0 and end at (n - i -1), so j will run from 0 to (n-i-2) inclusive.\n\nWait no: in the first pass i=0: inner loop runs j from 0 to (n - 0 -1 -1) ??? Wait, no, I think I got it wrong.\n\nWait in the beginning, for the first pass (i=0), the inner loop should go from j=0 to j = n - 2. Because for j and j+1, the last pair to check is j =n-2, j+1= n-1.\n\nSo the inner loop goes up to j < (n -1), but wait no. The range should be from 0 to (n-1) and j+1 <n is to be checked.\n\nWait wait no, maybe using (n -i - 1) wouldn't be right.\n\nLet me reevaluate.\n\nThink when i is the current pass. After each pass, the largest element is bubbled to the end, so after pass 1 (i=0), the last element is in correct position. So in pass 2 (i=1), the inner loop only needs to go up to n-i-1-1= n-2, or wait thinking.\n\nWait for j in 0 to (n-i-2): so for each i, j runs from 0 to (n - i - 2). Therefore, in the inner loop, the range is 0 to (n - i -1), because the end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for each i in range(n-1):\n\nthen, for j in 0 to (n-i-1 -1), but that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the inner loop could be written as for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n\nWait, yes. Because in the first pass (i=0), j runs from 0 to (n - 1) (since n-0-1 is n-1, so range is 0 to n-1, making j go up to n-2, which is correct). For i=1, run j from 0 to (n-2), which is correct, since in the second pass, the last element is already sorted, so the (n-1)th is correct.\n\nSo the inner loop is: for j in range(0, n - i - 1).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = len(sorted_arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n\n   swapped = False\n\n   for j in range(0, n - i -1):\n\n       if sorted_arr[j] > sorted_arr[j+1], swap them, set swapped to True.\n\nThen, after the j loop, check if swapped is False. If yes, break.\n\nThis should correctly implement bubble sort.\n\nTesting the sample cases.\n\nSample 1: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n\nAfter initial copy, len is 7.\n\nFirst pass i=0:\n\nj runs from 0 to 5.\n\nCompare 64 and 34: swap. Now list is [34,64,...]. Set swapped=True.\n\nNext j=1: 64>25? Yes, swap to [34,25,64,...], swapped=True.\n\nj=2: 25 vs 12: swap to [34,25,12,64,...]. swapped. \n\nj=3: 12 vs 22: no swap. So list remains.\n\nj=4: 22 vs 11: swap to [34,25,12,11,22,64...]. swapped.\n\nj=5: 22 vs 90. No swap.\n\nAfter j loop, swapped is True.\n\nFor next passes, i=1.\n\nj runs from 0 to 5 (7-1-1=5? Wait no, 7-1-1=5, so range is up to 5, but in Python range(0,5) is 0-4.\n\nWait, corrected: inner loop is for j in range(0, n -i -1). So for i=1, n-i-1 is 7 -1 -1=5. So j loops from 0 to 5-1=4.\n\nSo in j from 0 to 4 inclusive?\n\nWait, no: in Python range(0, n - i -1) with i=1, n=7: 7-1-1=5, so j goes from 0 to 4 inclusive (since in range, the upper limit is exclusive). Oh wait wait, no. range is from 0 to (n - i -1). So when n -i -1 is 5, j runs from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4: which ends when j is 4, so j+1 is 5, which is 90.\n\nSo, let's see. But after first pass, the list is [34,25,12,11,22,64,90]. Wait the largest element is 90, bubbled to end.\n\nIn the second pass i=1:\n\nCheck elements up to index 5-1 =4? Or up to 5.\n\nWait j runs up to 4 (since n-i-1 is 5 in this case, but for i=0, it's 6-1=6- I think maybe my earlier logic is inverted. Let me think: in pass i=0, the last element is bubbled; in pass i=1, the previous element is considered.\n\nI think I'm getting tangled. Maybe to better approach this, let's take a small example.\n\nSample [5,3,8,2,1] ?\n\nPass 0:\n\nj runs from 0 to 3 (since 5-0-1=4, range is 0-4, which is 4 elements, j=0,1,2,3,4 (no, wait no, range(0,4) is 0,1,2,3; so j goes up to 3, j+1 is 4.\n\nSo in each j step, the inner loop will compare through 0-1,1-2, etc., up to 3-4. So that is correct.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps the code as earlier approach is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps proceed with implementing with the inner loop as:\n\nfor j in range(n - i - 1):\n\nand see.\n\nTesting another sample case:\n\nbubble_sort([-2, -34, -60, -1, -50] should return [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1].\n\nLet's see.\n\nsorted_arr is [-2, -34, -60, -1, -50]\n\nn=5.\n\ni=0:\n\nloop j from 0 to 4 (n - 0 -1 is 4, so j in 0 to 3):\n\nLooking at j=0: -2 and -34: swap. sorted_arr becomes [-34, -2, -60, -1, -50]\n\nj=1: -2 and -60: swap \u2192 [-34, -60, -2, -1, -50]\n\nj=2: -2 and -1: no swap.\n\nj=3: -1 and -50 \u2192 swap. So now [-34, -60, -2, -50, -1]\n\nswapped is True.\n\nProceed to i=1.\n\nn-i-1 = 5 -1 -1=3.\n\nj in 0 to 2 (since range(0,3) \u2192 0,1,2).\n\nFor j=0: -34 and -60 \u2192 34 is larger? Wait, no, because -34 is larger than -60? Yep, because -34 is bigger in value. So swap \u2192 [-60, -34, ...]\n\nThen j=1: -34 and -2 \u2192 -34 is larger than -2, swap \u2192 [-60, -2, -34, ...]\n\nj=2: -34 and -50 \u2192 comparing: -34 is larger than -50 \u2192 swap \u2192 [-60, -2, -50, -34, -1]\n\nswapped remains True.\n\nProceed to i=2.\n\nn -i -1 = 5-2-1=2. j runs 0-1 (range(0,2) \u2192 0,1).\n\nAfter previous pass:\n\n[-60, -2, -50, -34, -1]\n\nj=0: -2 and -50: is -2 > -50? Yes. Swap \u2192 [-60, -50, -2, ...]\n\nj=1: -2 and -34: yes, swap \u2192 [-60, -50, -34, ...]\n\nsorted_arr at this point is [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1]\n\nswapped = True.\n\ni=3:\n\nn-i-1 =5-3-1=1. So j runs 0 (range(0,1)).\n\nCompare -2 and -1 \u2192 yes, swap \u2192 [...] , -1 is correct.\n\nSo then, I increment i.\n\nWait, no. When i=3, in the j loop, j is 0:\n\nafter i=2 pass, sorted_arr is [-60, -50, -34, -2, -1].\n\nj=0: -2 >-1 \u2192 yes, swap \u2192 becomes [-60, -50, -34, -1, -2].\n\nThen, swapped is True.\n\nBut then, after the inner loop, we process.\n\nIn the next pass i=3:\n\nWait, no, because i runs from 0 to n-1 =4.\n\nWait n is 5, so for i in 0 to 4.\n\nSo in this case, after pass i=2, the array is [ -60, -50, -34, -2, -1 ]\n\nWait, in the next pass (i=3), j runs from 0 to (5-3-1) =1.\n\nWait, wait no, wait 5-3-1 is 1. So range(0,1) \u2192 j=0.\n\nAfter comparing -2 and -1, swapped = True.\n\nBut in the next pass i=4.\n\nWait, no, because for j... the code would then go to i=4.\n\nBut wait, in the code it's for i in range(n): which is 0-4, so 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWhen i=4, the inner loop runs for j in range(0, n-i-1) =5-4-1=0. So range(0,0) \u2192 loop does nothing.\n\nBut in the previous pass, after i=3, do any swaps happen after i=3?\n\nWait let me think.\n\nMaybe in code, after each pass i, the j loop does n-i-1 comparisons.\n\nWait perhaps the code would not have passed i=3, because the array was [ -60, -50, -34, -1, -2 ] during i=3.\n\nAfter i=3's inner loop: j runs 0. So j=0 compares elements 3 and 4? Wait, no, because sorted_arr is [ after i=3's loop ].\n\nWait confusion, perhaps implementing the code and testing is faster, but since I can't do that right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding print statements in the code.\n\nBut perhaps the implementation will handle it correctly.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting also the third example:\n\nSample: [-2, 34, -60, 12, -50, 72] should return [-60, -50, -2, 12, 34,72]\n\nProcess:\n\nAfter pass 0: the largest element is 72, should be at end.\n\nWait other passes should handle the rest, but perhaps this is correct.\n\nNow, about the edge cases: empty list returns empty, single element. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: [4,2,1,2,3,4] should sort to [1,2,2,3,4,4]. The code will handle duplicate elements correctly, because if elements are equal, they won't be swapped.\n\nSo, in summary, the code seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the bubble sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\nBubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Make a Copy**: Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list.\n2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through the list using an outer loop that runs from 0 to the length of the list minus one.\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, use an inner loop to compare each pair of adjacent elements up to the point where the largest element has bubbled up to its correct position in the previous pass.\n4. **Swapping Elements**: If an element is greater than the next element, swap them and set a flag to indicate that a swap occurred.\n5. **Early Termination**: If no swaps occur during an iteration of the outer loop, the list is already sorted, and we can terminate the process early.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    sorted_arr = arr[:]  # Make a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it\n    n = len(sorted_arr)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False  # Flag to check if any swap occurred in the current pass\n        \n        # We need to compare each element with the next one up to (n - i - 1) times\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if sorted_arr[j] > sorted_arr[j + 1]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                sorted_arr[j], sorted_arr[j + 1] = sorted_arr[j + 1], sorted_arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        \n        # If no swaps were made in the current pass, the array is already sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    \n    return sorted_arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Making a Copy**: The function starts by creating a copy of the input list to ensure the original list remains unmodified.\n- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list. Each iteration of this loop represents a pass through the list.\n- **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs from the start of the list up to `n-i-1`, where `i` is the current pass number. This reduces the number of comparisons in each subsequent pass because the largest elements have already been bubbled to their correct positions.\n- **Swapping Elements**: Inside the inner loop, each pair of adjacent elements is compared. If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped, and a flag is set to indicate that a swap occurred.\n- **Early Termination**: If no swaps occur during a pass, the list is already sorted, and the function breaks out of the outer loop early, improving efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted efficiently using bubble sort, handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements correctly.",
