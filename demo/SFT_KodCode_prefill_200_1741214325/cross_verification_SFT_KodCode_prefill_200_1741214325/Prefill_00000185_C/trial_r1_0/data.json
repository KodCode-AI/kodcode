  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to write a Python function called gcd that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using Euclid's algorithm. Hmm, I remember that the Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder when it's divided by the smaller, and so on until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nWait, let's think about how that works step by step. Like, when a is 12 and b is 18. The algorithm starts by seeing which is larger\u2014so 18 divided by 12 gives a quotient, and a remainder. 18 mod 12 is 6. Now we replace a and b, and now we find GCD of 12 and 6. 12 mod 6 is 0, so the GCD is 6. That makes sense.\n\nSo the function needs to handle this process. How do I handle recursive steps for this? Or maybe an iterative approach is better to avoid recursion depth issues?\n\nWell, recursion might be straightforward, but for some cases with very large numbers, it could hit Python's recursion limit. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the constraints, so maybe the test cases are small.\n\nBut just to be safe, I should think of an iterative version perhaps.\n\nSo the function gcd takes two integers, a and b. Wait, should I handle it when a is zero? Because if a and b are both zero, the GCD is undefined, but if a is zero and b is not, then GCD is the absolute value of b. Oh right, and also, I should probably take the absolute values since GCD is defined for positive integers.\n\nWait, the problem says a and b are integers, but they could be negative. So I should convert them to absolute values first.\n\nSo, plan:\n\nFirst, ensure both a and b are treated as their absolute values, because GCD is the same for the negatives.\n\nIf both are zero, it's undefined; perhaps return 0? Or maybe in the context of this function, it's outside the expected inputs.\n\nSo, in the function:\n\nHandle the case when both are zero, but assuming that the function is called with at least one non-zero integer, as per the test cases.\n\nThen, find the GCD using Euclid's algorithm iteratively.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the absolute values of a and b to handle negative numbers.\n\n2. While b is not zero:\n\n   a. temp = b\n\n   b. b = a mod b\n\n   c. a = temp\n\n3. When b is zero, a is the GCD.\n\nSo, the function would assign a and b as their absolute values. Then loop.\n\nWait, let's see code-wise:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # compute absolute values\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nDoes that make sense? For example, 12 and 18.\n\na starts as 12, b as 18. Wait, wait, no\u2014I think I mixed that up. Because the initial step is to make sure that a is larger? Or does the algorithm automatically handle that when a < b?\n\nLet me see: if a starts as 12 and b is 18.\n\nWait, initial a is 12, but b is 18. So in the loop, temp = b is 18, then b becomes a mod b which is 12 mod 18 which is 12. Because 12 is less than 18, mod returns 12. Then a becomes temp, which is 18.\n\nSo now a is 18, b is 12. Next iteration, compute 18 mod 12 = 6. So now, a is 12, b is 6.\n\nNext, a mod b is 0. After that, b is 12 mod 6, which is 0. So the loop stops, and a is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 7 and 13.\n\n7 and 13. Let's step through:\n\na is 7, b 13.\n\nSince b is not zero, swap: a becomes 13, b becomes7 mod 13 is 7.\n\nWait, 7 mod 13 is 7.\n\nSo a is now 13, b is 7.\n\nThen next step: a=7, b=13 mod7 = 6.\n\nThen a=7, b=6.\n\nNow 7 mod6 is 1, so a=6, b=1.\n\n6 mod1 is 0, so a=1, b=0.\n\nLoop ends. Return 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 98 and 56.\n\na is 98, b is56.\n\nFirst step, as 98 is bigger: 56 and 98 mod56 is 42 (56*1=56, 98-56=42).\n\nNow a becomes56, b=42.\n\nThen 56 mod42=14.\n\na=42, b=14.\n\n42 mod14= 0. a becomes14, b becomes0. So return14, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that. So that's the plan for the gcd function.\n\nNow, the lcm function. It needs to compute the Least Common Multiple of two integers.\n\nI remember that LCM can be calculated using the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). But wait, if a or b is zero, that could be a problem. But as per the problem description, let's see the examples:\n\nLike, the example shows lcm(12, 18) is 36.\n\nWhich is (12 *18)/6 = 216/6=36, yes.\n\nSimilarly, lcm(98,56)=392. Let's compute 98*56 is 5488, divided by 14 gives 5488/14=392.\n\nBut what if a or b is zero? Then LCM is zero, if either is zero. But let's see, maybe the function is called with non-zero a and b.\n\nBut as the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we should handle cases where either a or b is zero.\n\nWait, if a is zero and b is zero, then LCM is zero (since every number divides zero? Or is it undefined?), I think convention is that LCM(0,0) is zero, but for LCM(0, non-zero), it's zero.\n\nSo perhaps in the function, first handle if a is zero or b is zero: return zero.\n\nOtherwise, compute using the formula.\n\nSo, steps for lcm function:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n\nHandle case when a or b is zero: return 0.\n\nElse, compute lcm as (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd(a, b). Because we have to avoid floating points\u2014using integer division.\n\nWait, but wait: a and b are integers, so if they have a GCD d, then (a * b) will be divisible by d, so integer division is safe.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd(a, b)\n\nWait, but why the abs a and abs b? Because for negative numbers, the LCM would still be positive. For example, lcm(-12, 18) = 36.\n\nYes, because the LCM is always a positive integer, regardless of the sign of the inputs.\n\nWait, but when a is -12 and b is 18, the product is -216. Divided by 6 gives -36. While the actual lcm should be 36. So, taking absolute values is necessary.\n\nSo, in the formula, to compute (a*b), the sign is not an issue because when we take their absolute values, it's a positive product, and then the division is correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could compute using a and b's absolute values within the LCM function, which is what I have in the code.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps to compute as a * b // gcd, but take absolute values of a and b to make sure the sign doesn't matter.\n\nAlternatively, the function could return (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd(a,b). So, perhaps the if statement catches when either is zero, then returns zero, else applies the formula.\n\nDoes that work?\n\nTesting example given:\n\nlcm(12, 18):\n\ngcd is 6. (12 * 18) = 216, divided by 6 gives 36, correct.\n\nlcm(7,13): 7*13=91, gcd 1, so 91.\n\nlcm(98,56): 98*56=5488 //14= 392.\n\nSo that works.\n\nWhat about negative numbers?\n\nFor example, a=-2, b=3.\n\ngcd(2,3)=1. So (2*3)/1=6. lcm is 6.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if a =0 ? According to the if statement, returns 0.\n\nWhat if a=0 and b is 5, then returns 0.\n\nWhich is correct, as the lcm of 0 and any number is 0.\n\nAlright.\n\nSo to implement:\n\nFor the lcm function, first check if either a or b is zero. Return zero.\n\nElse, compute the product of absolute values of a and b divided by their GCD.\n\nSo, using integer division (//) to avoid any floating points.\n\nI can even test with a=0, but the problem examples don't provide that, so perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nOkay, so writing the code accordingly.\n\nWait, but what about when a or b is zero and the other is non-zero\u2014the function correctly returns zero, as if one is zero, the multiple is undefined, but in the context, the code returns 0 when a or b is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now I have to write both functions.\n\nBut the lcm function depends on the gcd function, so they need to be in the same scope.\n\nBut in the way the problem is presented, they're two separate functions, so that's okay.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nWait, the function names: both are functions to implement.\n\nFor the gcd function:\n\nWait, in Python, if a and b are zero, the code as above will run into an infinite loop because in the loop:\n\nInitially, a =0, b=0.\n\nIn the loop: a and b are both 0, so b is zero\u2014so wait, the loop condition is 'while b !=0'. So for a=0, b=0, the loop doesn't run. Then return a, which is 0. But wait, that's not correct if both are zero, as GCD(0,0) is undefined. But in the code as written, when both are zero, a and b are zero, so returning zero.\n\nBut according to many mathematical definitions, there's no GCD for zero and zero. So perhaps the function should raise an error or handle it.\n\nBut the problem's examples don't include this case. Looking back, the test cases in the function's docstring don't have a case where a or b is zero, so maybe the code doesn't have to handle that. Or if it is called, perhaps in the function, both a and b being zero could cause problems.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can assume that a and b are non-zero. But to make the code robust, it's better to have the function handle cases of zero.\n\nSo if both a and b are zero, then if they're passed as arguments to gcd, it would return zero. But according to mathematical standards, it's undefined. However, perhaps our code doesn't need to handle that, as it's not part of the problem's requirements.\n\nSo for the current problem, the code should handle all cases as per the test cases provided in the problem statement. So let's proceed with the code as in the previous plan.\n\nTherefore, the final code should be:\n\nImplement the GCD using iterative Euclid's algorithm, with taking absolute values.\n\nImplement the LCM as (a*b)//gcd(a,b) with checks when a or b is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function code will be as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement two functions: `gcd` and `lcm`. The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using Euclid's algorithm, while the `lcm` function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers using the GCD function.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **GCD Calculation using Euclid's Algorithm**:\n    - **Problem Analysis**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. Euclid's algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly applying the modulus operation until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n    - **Intuition**: By replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the two numbers, we iteratively reduce the problem size. This process continues until the remainder becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.\n    - **Edge Cases**: Handle negative numbers by converting them to their absolute values, as GCD is the same for the positives.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation using GCD**:\n    - **Problem Analysis**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Using the relationship LCM(a, b) = (|a| * |b|) // GCD(a, b), we can efficiently compute the LCM once the GCD is known.\n    - **Intuition**: The product of two numbers divided by their GCD gives the LCM. We use the absolute values to ensure the result is non-negative.\n    - **Edge Cases**: If either number is zero, the LCM is zero because zero is a multiple of every number.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.\"\"\"\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd(a, b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **GCD Function**:\n  - Convert both inputs to their absolute values to handle negative numbers.\n  - Use a loop to iteratively apply Euclid's algorithm, where the larger number is replaced by the remainder of the division of the two numbers. This continues until the remainder is zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.\n\n- **LCM Function**:\n  - Check if either input is zero and return zero immediately, as LCM of zero with any number is zero.\n  - Use the formula (|a| * |b|) // GCD(a, b) to compute the LCM, ensuring the result is non-negative and an integer.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes both GCD and LCM in an optimal manner, handling all edge cases appropriately.",
