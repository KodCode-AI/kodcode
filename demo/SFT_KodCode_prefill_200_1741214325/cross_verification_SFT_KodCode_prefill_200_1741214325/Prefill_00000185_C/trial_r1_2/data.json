  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write two functions: gcd and lcm. Let me think about how to do this.\n\nStarting with the gcd function. Oh right, the greatest common divisor can be calculated using Euclid's algorithm. I remember that Euclid's method involves repeatedly applying division to find the remainder and then using the remainder as the new divisor until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo how do I implement this? Let me think. I think it would be a good idea to make this as a function. Maybe a recursive approach would be clean. Because in each step, the GCD of a and b is the same as the GCD of b and a mod b. So the base case is when b is zero, then the GCD is a.\n\nLet me see, so the function would take a and b. Wait, but what if a is less than b? Oh, because when the function is called recursively, it swaps if needed. For example, gcd(18,12) would call gcd(12, 6) then gcd(6,0), so it returns 6. So the initial call could handle a being larger or smaller.\n\nSo I'll write the gcd function recursively. First, check if b is zero, if so return a. Otherwise, return gcd(b, a % b).\n\nNow for the lcm function. LCM is the least common multiple, which can be found using the formula: lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b). But wait, I should make sure that a and b are positive. So in the lcm function, I need to calculate this.\n\nWait, but what if either a or b is zero? Oh, wait, the problem says a and b are integers, but do the test cases have zeros? Looking at the sample inputs, like 12 and 18, no zeros. So perhaps in the problem's context, a and b are positive integers? The problem description mentions that the functions are for two numbers; maybe they are positive. I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo in the lcm function, compute the gcd of a and b, then compute (a * b) divided by that number. But wait, doing a * b could cause an overflow, but for now, I think it's acceptable as per the problem constraints.\n\nSo the steps for the lcm function:\n1. Calculate the gcd of a and b.\n2. Multiply a and b.\n3. Divide the product by the gcd.\n4. Return the result.\n\nBut wait, I should convert them to integers or handle any cases where division might not be exact, but since a and b are multiples of the GCD, it should always be an integer.\n\nSo now, let's outline the code.\n\nFirst the gcd function:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n\nWait, but what if a is zero? Like, gcd(0, 5) should be 5, right? Because any number and zero's GCD is the number. Looking at the function, in the base case, when b is zero, you return a. So if a is zero and b is non-zero, when you first call gcd(a=0, b=5), it will check if b (5) is zero, which it isn't. So it returns gcd(5, 0%5), which is gcd(5, 0). Then b is zero, so returns a which is 5. So that works.\n\nWhat if both a and b are zero? Well, GCD is undefined, but per the function, it'll return zero in that case. But maybe the problem doesn't test that scenario.\n\nOkay, moving on. So the gcd function should be written as above.\n\nNow the lcm function:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    g = gcd(a, b)\n    return (a * b) // g\n\nWait, but what if a or b is zero? Then the product is zero. Like, lcm(0,5) would cause the code to compute (0*5)/g. What's g? Because the gcd of 0 and 5 is 5. So 0*5 is 0, divided by 5 is 0. Which is correct since 0 is a multiple of both, so the lcm is 0. So that works in this case.\n\nBut wait, what if both are zero? Then, (0*0)/gcd(0,0) is (0)/0, which is undefined (Zero division error). So in that case, the function will crash. But according to the problem description, in the sample inputs, both a and b are positive integers. So for the given problem, perhaps this case isn't required to be handled.\n\nSo the lcm function should be okay.\n\nWait, but in Python, when you do division with //, since a*b and g are integers, it automatically does integer division. So for example, 12*18=216, divided by 6 gives 36.0 if using / but using // gives 36 as int.\n\nSo converting to int is necessary? Or no, because in Python 3, 12*18 is 216, which is an integer, and 216 divided by 6 using // is 36, an integer. So the return type is an integer.\n\nNow testing the examples.\n\ngcd(12,18): 12 and 18, the steps are:\ngcd(12, 18) \u2192 gcd(18, 12%18=12) \u2192 gcd(12,18%12=6) \u2192 gcd(6, 12%6=0) \u2192 returns 6. Correct.\n\ngcd(7,13): 7 and 13 \u2192 their GCD is 1. Correct.\n\ngcd(98,56): let's see. 98 % 56 is 42, then gcd(56,42), then 56%42=14. Then gcd(42,14), 42%14=0. So returns 14. Correct.\n\nFor the LCM function:\n\nlcm(12,18) is (12*18)/(6) \u2192 216/6=36. Correct.\n\nlcm(7,13): 7*13=91 / 1 =91. Correct.\n\nlcm(98,56): 98*56=5488 /14=392. Correct.\n\nSo the functions should pass these test cases.\n\nWait, but what about when a is zero? Like lcm(0,5) returns 0. Is that acceptable?\n\nIn the problem description, the sample inputs don't include zeros, so I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the code I need to write is:\n\nImplement the gcd function using Euclid's algorithm, then the lcm as (a*b)/gcd(a,b).\n\nBut I should make sure to handle when a or b is zero. Although the problem says the functions are for two numbers, I'm not told that a and b are non-zero, but perhaps the test cases only use positive numbers.\n\nWait, looking back, the examples have positive integers, but in code, I should consider that a and b can be zero. But without specific error handling, the function can return the correct mathematical result.\n\nBut perhaps in the code, the functions can handle any integer, including negatives. Because in the problem description, they say a and b are integers, not necessarily positive.\n\nAh, so I need to think about negative numbers.\n\nFor example, what is gcd(-12, 18)? The greatest common divisor is 6. Should the function return 6 or -6? Or, because GCD is always a positive number. So perhaps I should take the absolute value of a and b first.\n\nBecause in Euclid's algorithm, the sign isn't considered. So to make sure the numbers are positive, perhaps we should take absolute values.\n\nYes, because the GCD is always non-negative, since it's the greatest common positive divisor.\n\nSo in the gcd function, I should take the absolute values of a and b.\n\nLet me adjust the function:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n\nWait, but if either a or b is negative, we take the absolute value. So for example, gcd(-12, 18): a is 12, b 18. Then 12 mod 18 is 12. Return gcd(18,12), which gives us 6.\n\nSo yes, the correct result.\n\nBut wait, in the function I wrote earlier, because a and b are parameters, and when calling the function, the initial a and b are converted to their absolute values, but then the recursive calls pass b (unmodified) and a mod b. But actually, a and b inside the function have been converted to absolute values in the first call.\n\nSo in the first call, say, a is -12 and b is 18. They become 12 and 18. Then, in the recursive calls, after the first step, it will be 18, 12. So yes, that will work.\n\nWait, but wait in the first step, after taking a = abs(a), etc., then in the first recursive call, it's passing (b, a% b) which are the original a and b (after absolute). So the initial approach should work.\n\nYes, because the first step makes sure that a and b are positive. All the further recursive steps will have positive numbers because both b and a mod b are positive when a and b are positive.\n\nSo the adjustments to the gcd function are necessary to handle negative numbers.\n\nBut the problem description's sample inputs only use positive numbers, but as the function is supposed to accept any integers, the code should handle that.\n\nSo I need to modify the gcd function accordingly.\n\nNow, the lcm function: when a and b are negative. Because LCM is defined as positive, the formula (a*b) would be positive if a and b are both negative, but negative if one is negative. So then I take the absolute value of the result.\n\nWait, for example, lcm(-4, 6): the lcm is 12. But using (a*b) would be -24. divided by gcd(4,6)=2 \u2192 -24/2= -12, but the lcm should be 12. So to correct that, perhaps the lcm function should return the absolute value.\n\nOr perhaps the formula (a*b)//g can be negative, but the lcm is defined as a positive integer. So perhaps the lcm function should return the absolute value of the result.\n\nWait, but wait: (a*b) is 4*6=24, divided by 2 is 12. If a and b are both negatives, a*b is positive as well.\n\nWait, wait, for -4 and 6: a is -4, b is 6. So a*b is -24. The GCD of 4 and6 is 2. So -24/2=-12. But the LCM of -4 and 6 is 12. So the function returns -12. Which is not correct.\n\nSo to avoid this, perhaps I should take absolute values in the lcm function as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the lcm function I should use absolute values of a and b.\n\nBecause LCM is defined as the smallest positive integer. So perhaps the solution is to calculate the LCM of the absolute values.\n\nSo in the lcm function, regardless of a and b's sign, it's equivalent to the LCM of |a| and |b|.\n\nSo perhaps I should modify the lcm function.\n\nLet me think: in the lcm function, I'll take the absolute values of a and b, calculate their positive product, then divide by their gcd, which is also based on absolute values.\n\nBecause in the sample inputs, all a and b are positive, but the functions are supposed to accept any integers.\n\nSo in the lcm function, I will first compute the absolute values of a and b, then apply the formula.\n\nSo code for lcm:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    a_abs = abs(a)\n    b_abs = abs(b)\n    g = gcd(a_abs, b_abs)\n    return (a_abs * b_abs) // g\n\nBecause if a_abs is zero and b_abs is zero, it causes a division by zero, but again, we can assume that the problem expects that.\n\nWait, if a_abs and b_abs are both zero, then lcm is undefined, but according to our function, (0*0)=0 / (gcd(0,0)=0 \u2192 division by zero error.\n\nSo for the problem's purposes, perhaps this case is not required, as sample inputs are non-zero.\n\nHence, for the functions:\n\ngcd takes absolute values of a and b.\n\nlcm takes absolute values, then returns (a_abs * b_abs) // g.\n\nSo the final functions are:\n\nFor gcd:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n\nWait, no, in the first line, 'a = abs(a)', but the parameters are in the function definition and the function is called with the initial a and b. So if in the first call, a is negative, it's converted to positive. But then, the recursive calls pass the same a and b (or a mod b). So the function's recursive calls would always receive positive a and b?\n\nWait no. For example, consider the first call is a= -12 and b=18.\n\nIn the function, a becomes 12, b becomes 18.\n\nSince b is not zero, compute gcd(b, a%b), which is 18 and (12 mod 18)= 12.\n\nSo the next call is a=18, b=12.\n\nAgain, a=18 is positive, b=12 positive.\n\nThen compute gcd(12, 18 mod 12 =6).\n\nThen a=12, b=6.\n\ngcd(6, 12 mod6=0). Then a=6, b=0. So return a=6.\n\nAll works.\n\nThus, the function correctly handles negative numbers.\n\nSo to sum up, the functions should:\n\nFor gcd: convert a and b to their absolute values first.\n\nFor lcm: convert a and b to absolute values, compute as (a_abs*b_abs) // g, where g is gcd(a_abs, b_abs).\n\nNow coding this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers using efficient algorithms. \n\n### Approach\n1. **GCD Calculation Using Euclid's Algorithm**: \n   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. Euclid's algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the GCD. It repeatedly replaces the larger number by the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at this point is the GCD.\n   - To handle negative numbers correctly, we take the absolute values of the input numbers before applying the algorithm.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation Using GCD**:\n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. The LCM can be derived using the formula: \\( \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\). Using the GCD ensures the result is an integer.\n   - Similar to the GCD, we handle negative inputs by considering their absolute values before calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.\"\"\"\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    if b == 0:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return gcd(b, a % b)\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    a_abs = abs(a)\n    b_abs = abs(b)\n    if a_abs == 0 and b_abs == 0:\n        return 0  # or raise an error, as LCM(0,0) is undefined\n    g = gcd(a_abs, b_abs)\n    return (a_abs * b_abs) // g\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **gcd(a, b)**:\n  - Convert inputs `a` and `b` to their absolute values to ensure the algorithm works correctly with negative numbers.\n  - Use recursion to repeatedly apply Euclid's algorithm, reducing the problem size until `b` becomes zero. The non-zero value at this point is the GCD.\n\n- **lcm(a, b)**:\n  - Convert inputs `a` and `b` to their absolute values.\n  - Compute the GCD of the absolute values.\n  - Use the formula \\( \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\) to find the LCM, ensuring the result is an integer.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both positive and negative integers and ensures correct results for edge cases, including when one or both inputs are zero.",
