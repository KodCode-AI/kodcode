  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write two functions in Python: one for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and another for the Least Common Multiple (LCM). Hmm, I remember that GCD and LCM are related. Oh right, the formula connects them: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). So, if I can implement the GCD function, the LCM should be easier since I can reuse the GCD function.\n\nWait, let's start with the GCD first. I think the best way is to use Euclid's algorithm because it's efficient. How does that work? Oh right, the basic idea is that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. So you can repeatedly subtract or use modulus. But the Euclidean algorithm is faster. So, for example, GCD(a, b) can be found by taking a mod b, then replacing a with b and b with the result, and repeating until b is zero. Then a is the GCD.\n\nSo for the GCD function, I'll take two integers a and b. But wait, what about if a is smaller than b? Oh, because in the Euclidean algorithm, it's okay to have a < b since (a mod b will be a). So the process remains correct. Alternatively, we can swap them to make sure a >= b each time, but I think Euclid's approach can handle any order.\n\nSo the steps for GCD(a, b):\n\n1. While b is not zero:\n   a. temp = b\n   b. b = a mod b\n   c. a = temp\n2. When b is zero, a is the GCD.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example. Let's say a is 48 and b is 18.\n\nFirst iteration:\na=48, b=18\ntemp = 18\nb becomes 48 mod 18 = 12\na becomes 18.\n\nSecond iteration:\na=18, b=12\ntemp =12\nb becomes 18 mod 12 = 6\na becomes 12.\n\nThird iteration:\na=12, b=6\ntemp=6\nb becomes 12 mod6=0\na becomes 6.\n\nNow, b is zero, so the GCD is 6. That makes sense.\n\nAnother test case: GCD(7,13). Euclid's method: since 13 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 6. Then 7 divided by 6 leaves 1, then 6 divided by 1 leaves 0. So GCD is 1. Another test: GCD(98,56).\n\nLet's see, 98 divided by56 is 1 with rem 42. Then 56 mod42 is14. 42 mod14 is 0. So GCD is14. That's correct.\n\nSo the code structure for GCD would be:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n\nWait, but what about when a is 0? Because if a is 0, then the loop will not run (since b is not zero?), but let me think.\n\nWait, suppose a is 0 and b is 0. But that's impossible because GCD(0,0) is undefined. But in our function, how do we handle it? Well, the problem statements perhaps assume a and b are positive integers. The function's docstring shows that.\n\nIn any case, looking at the sample inputs for GCD: 12 and 18; 7 and13; 98 and56. So both a and b are positive. So perhaps we don't have to handle 0 or negative numbers, since the function's parameters are specified as int but possibly called with positive values.\n\nBut it's better to think about ensuring it works for non-negative integers. But if a is 0, and b is non-zero, the GCD is b (since GCD(0, b) = |b|). So maybe the function should handle that.\n\nWait, what's the initial state: if b is 0, the loop won't run, and a is the GCD. But if a is not 0, that's fine. But if a is 0, then b is the GCD? Wait, no because if both are 0, it's undefined. So in the function, perhaps we should first handle cases where a or b is 0.\n\nIn the examples, the function is called with a = 12, etc., which are positive, but the function takes int, perhaps negative values passed. So perhaps we should take absolute values first.\n\nYes, because GCD is defined for non-negative integers. So perhaps the first step is to take absolute values of a and b.\n\nWait, the problem probably expects a and b to be positive, but code defensively.\n\nSo in the GCD function, I'll convert a and b to their absolute values first.\n\nSo revised step:\n\na = abs(a)\nb = abs(b)\n\nSo if a or b is zero. So for example, if a is 0, then GCD is b. Because, if b is non-zero. Oh wait, in the algorithm, if a is zero, and b is non-zero. Suppose a is 0 and b is 5.\n\nThen first, temp =5, then b =0 mod 5 is 0. So a becomes5, and the next iteration, b is zero, so return 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother scenario: both a and b are zero. Well, the GCD is undefined, but the function would enter a=0, b=0. The while loop won't run because b is zero. So the function returns a, which is 0. But mathematically, GCD(0,0) is undefined. However, perhaps in code, it's better to handle that case.\n\nBut in the problem's context, maybe zero is not passed. But to make the function robust, perhaps we should account for that.\n\nWait, in the sample test cases, the function seems to return expected values without this, but perhaps the code will handle it as is.\n\nWait, let's see: If a is zero and b is not zero, the loop runs once.\n\nLet me simulate a=0, b=5:\n\nInside GCD function:\n\nLoop while b !=0:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nb is 5, which is not zero.\n\ntemp =5\n\nb is 0 % 5 which is 0.\n\na is set to5.\n\nThen, since b is zero, loop ends.\n\nThe function returns a which is5, correct.\n\nIf a is5 and b is zero: same as above. The function returns5.\n\nSo the function seems to handle the cases when one of the numbers is zero.\n\nWait, initial case: say a is0, b is0.\n\nThe function returns a, which is0. But in this case, GCD is undefined. But perhaps the function is intended to be used with positive integers, as per the problem statement.\n\nSo perhaps I don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n\nWait, but how is that? Because when both a and b are non-zero, the algorithm proceeds. When one is zero, it's handled correctly.\n\nSo that's the gcd function.\n\nNow, the lcm function. As mentioned earlier, lcm(a, b) is (a*b) divided by gcd(a, b). Wait, but what if a or b is zero? Because if either a or b is zero, their lcm is zero. Because LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So if either is zero, the only multiple possible is zero.\n\nSo in code, perhaps first handle the case where either a or b is zero, so return zero.\n\nOtherwise, compute as (a * b) // gcd(a, b). Because both a and b are positive at that point.\n\nWait, but wait: because when dealing with a and b as in their absolute values, when one is zero, in previous code, but in the problem statement, the lcm function is to be used with two numbers, perhaps positive.\n\nBut in the code, perhaps the lcm function should first check if a or b is zero.\n\nSo let's think about it.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut wait, since the gcd function ensures a and b are positive (since it takes absolute values). Wait, no: the a and b passed to the lcm function are as in the parameters, but in the gcd function, we've taken their absolute values.\n\nAh, right: when computing GCD, a and b are absolute values.\n\nWait, but in the lcm function, if the original a or b is zero, the result is zero.\n\nSo in code, the lcm function should first handle this.\n\nSo first, in the lcm function, check if a or b is zero. If yes, return zero.\n\nElse, compute the product, divided by gcd of a and b.\n\nWait, but the product could be large; but as per the examples, it's okay.\n\nNow, for example:\n\nlcm(12,18) = 36.\n\nLet's compute: 12 *18 = 216. GCD(12, 18)=6. So 216/6 = 36, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: lcm(7, 13)=91. 7*13=91, GCD(7,13)=1. So 91/1=91.\n\nAnother example: lcm(98,56). Compute 98*56=5488, GCD is14, 5488/14=392. Correct.\n\nSo the logic is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if in the gcd function, a and b are swapped? Like in the first example, a was 12, b 18. GCD returns same regardless of order.\n\nSo the lcm function is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    if a ==0 or b ==0:\n        return 0\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut wait, in Python, integers can get very large, so handling multiplication may not be an issue. Also, since the function parameters are int, it's okay.\n\nSo to summarize, functions:\n\nImplement GCD using Euclidean algorithm, with absolute values. Then implement LCM using the formula.\n\nWait, but in the GCD function, what happens if a is greater than b after making them absolute?\n\nNo, because in the Euclidean algorithm, each step reduces the numbers. So it's okay whether a is larger or not.\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n\nSo now, writing the code:\n\nFor GCD:\n\nHandling the absolute values first.\n\nFor LCM:\n\nHandling the zero case, then using GCD.\n\nTesting the functions with the given examples:\n\nSample 1: gcd(12, 18) should return6; lcm(12,18) returns 36.\n\nSample 2: gcd(7,13)=1; lcm(7,13)=91.\n\nSample3: gcd(98,56)=14; lcm(98,56)=392.\n\nSo all should work.\n\nI think that's it. Now I'll write the functions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write two functions: one to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm, and another to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the GCD function. \n\n### Approach\n1. **GCD Calculation using Euclid's Algorithm**:\n   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. Euclid's algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly applying the modulo operation. Specifically, the algorithm works as follows:\n     - Convert both numbers to their absolute values to handle negative inputs.\n     - Use a loop to repeatedly replace the larger number with the remainder of the division of the two numbers until the remainder is zero. The non-zero number at this point is the GCD.\n\n2. **LCM Calculation using GCD**:\n   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. The formula to compute LCM using GCD is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n     \\]\n   - First, handle the edge case where either of the numbers is zero, as the LCM of zero and any number is zero.\n   - Otherwise, compute the product of the two numbers and divide by their GCD to get the LCM.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.\"\"\"\n    a = abs(a)\n    b = abs(b)\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.\"\"\"\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        return 0\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **GCD Function**:\n  - The function starts by converting both inputs to their absolute values to handle any negative numbers.\n  - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly computes the remainder of the division of the two numbers. The loop continues until the remainder is zero. The non-zero number at this point is the GCD.\n\n- **LCM Function**:\n  - This function first checks if either of the inputs is zero, in which case the LCM is zero.\n  - If both numbers are non-zero, it uses the formula \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\\) to compute the LCM, leveraging the previously defined GCD function to ensure efficient computation.\n\nThis approach ensures that both functions are efficient and handle edge cases appropriately, providing correct results for all valid inputs.",
