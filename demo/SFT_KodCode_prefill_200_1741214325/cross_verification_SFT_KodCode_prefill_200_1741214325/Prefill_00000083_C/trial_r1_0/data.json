  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called area_of_circle that takes a radius as a float and returns the area, also as a float. Let's think about what the area of a circle is. Oh right, the formula is \u03c0 multiplied by the radius squared.\n\nWait, but what about the radius being negative? Oh, the problem statement says the radius is a float, but does that include negative numbers? Well, in reality, the radius can't be negative because length can't be negative. But sometimes people might enter a negative value, so should I handle that? Looking at the examples, I see one where the radius is -1, and the area seems to be \u03c0, same as if the radius was 1. So maybe I should take the absolute value of the radius before squaring it. Or perhaps square it first because negative squared is positive. Oh right, squaring a negative number makes it positive, so whether the radius is positive or negative doesn't matter because when you square it, the result is positive. So I can proceed without checking the radius's sign.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Square the radius.\n2. Multiply by \u03c0.\n3. Return the result.\n\nBut wait, where do I get \u03c0 from? Oh, in Python, the math module has a pi constant. So I should import math and then use math.pi.\n\nWhat about if the radius is zero? Well, zero squared is zero, multiplied by \u03c0 is zero. The check in the examples shows that that's the expected behavior, so that's covered.\n\nSo the function is straightforward: import math, compute math.pi * radius ** 2.\n\nWait, but the function needs to handle any float, including integers passed as floats, like 1, 2, etc. So the function doesn't have to do any type conversion beyond that; the operations will handle it.\n\nSo putting it together: define the function, import math, compute and return \u03c0*r^2. Let me write that.\n\nWait, but functions usually don't import modules inside them, unless they're doing it every time, which isn't efficient. So I should import math at the top of the script, outside of the function.\n\nWait, but in coding platforms or exercises, the tests probably import math themselves. Oh, but looking at the problem, the example uses math.pi. So the function will need to have access to the math module.\n\nSo I'll have to make sure that the function has an import of math, but perhaps in the context where this function is used, math is already imported. Or maybe I should include the import inside the function. Wait no, that's not common practice. Let's make sure the function imports math, or at least that it's available.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is part of a script where math is already imported. So in my code, I should import math and then compute it.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef area_of_circle(radius: float) -> float:\n    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the examples have when radius is -1, the area is \u03c0, which matches 1 squared. So yes, squaring the radius takes care of negative numbers automatically, as explained before.\n\nSo no need to worry about negative values, because squaring them makes them positive.\n\nBut wait, what about very large radii, or radii with high decimal points? The function just computes it normally since it's using floating-point arithmetic.\n\nSo putting it all together, that's the function.\n\nLet me see the examples again:\n\narea_of_circle(1) should return \u03c0. So 1 squared is 1, multiplied by \u03c0 is \u03c0\u2014matches.\n\narea_of_circle(2) is 4\u03c0, correct.\n\nradius 0 gives 0. So that works.\n\nradius -1 is same as 1, gives \u03c0.\n\nAll test cases pass with this function.\n\nWait, but do I need to handle any edge cases? Probably not, since the function is straightforward and the examples cover the main cases.\n\nYes, I think that's the solution. So the code would import math and compute the area as described.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the area of a circle given its radius. The mathematical formula for the area of a circle is well-known and straightforward, but we must ensure the solution handles various cases, such as positive, negative, and zero values for the radius.\n\n### Approach\nThe area of a circle is calculated using the formula \\( \\pi \\times r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. Here, \\( \\pi \\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. \n\nKey considerations for the solution include:\n1. **Handling Negative Radius**: Although a negative radius does not make physical sense in geometry, mathematically squaring the radius will yield a positive result, so the area calculation remains valid.\n2. **Zero Radius**: If the radius is zero, the area will be zero, as expected.\n3. **Precision**: Using the constant \\( \\pi \\) from Python's math module ensures high precision in the result.\n\nGiven these considerations, the approach is to:\n1. Import the math module to access the constant \\( \\pi \\).\n2. Define a function that takes the radius as a parameter.\n3. Compute the area using the formula and return the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef area_of_circle(radius: float) -> float:\n    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Importing the Math Module**: The math module is imported to access the constant \\( \\pi \\), ensuring a high-precision value for calculations.\n- **Function Definition**: The function `area_of_circle` is defined to take a single parameter `radius` of type float and return the computed area as a float.\n- **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated by squaring the radius (which handles negative values by converting them to positive) and multiplying by \\( \\pi \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and accurate, handling all specified cases correctly.",
