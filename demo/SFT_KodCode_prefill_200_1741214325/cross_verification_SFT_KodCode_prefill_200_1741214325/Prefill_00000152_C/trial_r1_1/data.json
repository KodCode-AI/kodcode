  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called is_even that determines whether a given integer is even or odd. But I can't use if-else statements. Oh right, the hint says to use bitwise operators only. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, I remember that in binary, the least significant bit determines if a number is even or odd. If the last bit is 0, it's even; if it's 1, it's odd. So, how do I check that using bitwise operations.\n\nWait, using a bitwise AND might help here. Because if I do number & 1, that will give me 0 if it's even, and 1 if it's odd. So for even numbers, the result is 0, which would be Falsey in a boolean context. For odd numbers, it's 1, which is Truthy.\n\nWait, wait, but the function needs to return a boolean. So how can I convert that into True and False correctly. Because if I return number & 1, then even numbers would result in 0, so returning that would be False. But for even numbers, we want to return True. Hmm, not quite right. So that approach gives the inverse of what we need.\n\nWait no. Because the function is_even should return True when the number is even. So, when number & 1 is 0, the function should return True. When it's 1, return False.\n\nSo, how can we turn that into a boolean expression. In Python, 0 is False, and any non-zero is True. So, if I take the result of number & 1, then for even numbers, it's 0, which is treated as False in a boolean context. Wait, that's the opposite of what I want. Because for even numbers, I want is_even to return True.\n\nOh right. So perhaps I can take the expression (number & 1) and then invert it somehow. Another approach is to compute (number & 1) and then check if it's equal to 0. Because if it's equal to 0, then the number is even.\n\nSo something like (number & 1) == 0. Yes, but that's using a comparison operator, which isn't a bitwise operator, but it's allowed since I can use any condition, just not an if-else.\n\nWait no, the problem says I can't use if-else statements, but I can have a return statement with a condition based on operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use bitwise operations to manipulate the value into giving 1 for even and 0 for odd, then convert those to True and False.\n\nSo, let's think. The bitwise AND gives 1 for odd, 0 for even. So to invert that, we can subtract it from 1, but wait, in terms of bitwise operations, how else can we do it.\n\nWait, perhaps using the NOT operator. But in Python, the bitwise NOT is ~, which inverts all bits. Let's see what that does. For example, if number is 2, in binary 10. number & 1 is 0. ~0 would be -1, which is all 1s in binary, but wait, since it's signed integers, that's not helpful.\n\nSo that approach might not work. Another idea: since number & 1 is 0 for even, to get 1 for even, perhaps shift right? No, shifting doesn't seem to help.\n\nMaybe the simplest way is to compute (number & 1) and then negate it as a boolean. Because, when number is even, number & 1 is 0, which is False. Then, not (number & 1) becomes True. For odd, number & 1 is 1, so not becomes False.\n\nWait, wait! is_even should return True for even numbers, which is when (number & 1) is 0. So if I return not (number & 1), that would be True when even. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me test this logic with some examples.\n\nTest case 1: number = 2. number & 1 is 0. not 0 is True. So is_even returns True, correct.\n\nTest case 2: number = 3. 3 is 11, &1 is 1. not is False.\n\nTest case 3: number =0. 0&1 is 0. not is True.\n\nTest case 4: number =-4. In binary, negative numbers use two's complement. Let's see, -4 in binary is ... but when we do -4 & 1, let's think. In two's complement, the last bit for even numbers is 0. So -4 is even, so -4 &1 is 0. So not 0 is True.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the function can be written as return not (number & 1) But wait, in Python, the bitwise AND operator is &, and the not is a logical operator. So perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to make sure it returns a boolean, we can cast it as a bool. Wait, but in Python, not 0 is True, not 1 is False. So no need for casting.\n\nSo the function can be written directly as:\n\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return (number & 1) == 0\n\nWait, but that uses a comparison operator. Is that allowed? Because the problem states that I should only use bitwise operators. Oh, but the initial instruction said that I can't use if-else statements. So using a comparison operator like == is allowed as part of an expression.\n\nBut wait, the original instruction says: without using if else, can use bitwise operators only.\n\nWait, no. Maybe I misunderstood. The question says to use bitwise operators only; does it mean that I shouldn't use any other operators except bitwise? Or perhaps, in addition to any.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"You can use bitwise operators only.\" So perhaps they don't want me to use any other operations, but only bitwise.\n\nSo, for the conditions, I should avoid using == or !=. So how else to evaluate evenness.\n\nHmm, but in Python, what's the return value of a bitwise AND operation. For even numbers, number&1 is 0, which is treated as Falsey, as earlier.\n\nSo perhaps I can exploit the boolean conversion. Like, the return value should be the inverse of the least significant bit.\n\nSo, as earlier, return (number & 1) == 0 would be the straightforward way, but if that == is not allowed, then perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, does the == count as a comparison operator? The problem says that I can't use if-else, but can use bitwise operators only. So maybe the forbidden is if-else, but other operators are allowed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that 0 is False, and non-zero is True.\n\nWait, so if I negate number & 1, but since in Python, you can't just take the bitwise NOT since that changes all the bits. Wait, here's another approach:\n\nThe evenness is indicated when (number & 1) is 0. So, if I multiply (number &1) by False, but that's probably not helpful.\n\nWait, wait. How about using the XOR operator? Or another bitwise trick.\n\nAlternatively, if I do -(number &1) and then check if it's 0... Hmm, no, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute (number & 1) and then see if the result is zero. But again, that would use an equality check.\n\nWait, given that the condition shouldn't use 'if', but the return statement can use a logical expression, perhaps the initial idea of returning not (number & 1) is the way to go. Because when number is even, number &1 is 0, which is False, so not makes it True. When it's odd, number &1 is 1, which is True, so not makes it False. So the function returns True for even numbers.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return not (number & 1)\n\nYes, that should work. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nTest case 1: is_even(2) returns True.\n\nBecause 2 &1 is 0, not 0 is True.\n\nTest case 2: is_even(3) returns False: 3&1 is1 \u2192 not is False.\n\nTest case3: is_even(0) \u2192 0&1 is0 \u2192 not is True.\n\nTest case4: is_even(-4) \u2192 negative even. Let's see, -4 is 4 in two's comp negative, which is even. So -4&1 is 0 \u2192 not is True.\n\nTest case5: is_even(-3) \u2192 -3 is odd, &1 is 1. not is False.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAlternatively, think about using (number &1) and then inverting it. So True or False.\n\nSo another approach: return (number &1) ^ 1, but in the context, 0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0. Then, that would be True for even, but 1 is True, and to return a bool is is_even, which expect True if even.\n\nWait, no. Because (number &1) would return 0 or 1. XOR 1 would give 1 and 0. So 0 \u2192 1, 1\u21920. So, return (number&1)^1 would evaluate to 1 for even, 0 otherwise. Then, in Python, 1 is True, 0 is False.\n\nSo, return (number&1)^1 would evaluate to True for even (since 0^1 is 1\u2192True), and False for odd (1^1 is 0\u2192False). So that should also work.\n\nWait, no.  is_even is supposed to return True when even. Let's see:\n\nIf number is 2 \u2192 even. 2&1 is 0 \u2192 0^1 is 1 \u2192 which is True. So correct.\n\nnumber is 3 \u2192 3&1 is1 \u21921^1 is 0 \u2192 which is False. Correct.\n\nnumber is 0 \u21920^1 is 1 \u2192True. Correct.\n\nnumber is -4 \u2192-4&1 is0 \u21920^1 is 1 \u2192True. Correct.\n\nYes, so that works. So another approach is to do: return (number & 1) ^ 1, which would be 1 if even and 0 otherwise, but wait no. Wait, 0^1 is 1, which is True. 1^1 is0, which is False. So in the function it returns True or False correctly.\n\nWait, but function is_even returns bool, and 1 and 0 are integer. So if we return (number&1)^1, the result is 0 or 1, which are int. So then we need to return it as a boolean. So the function would return True or False automatically when converting 0 and 1 to bool. For example, 1 is non-zero, so bool(1) is True, 0 is False.\n\nWait no: 0 is False, 1 is True. So using that, (number&1)^1 gives 1 for even (True), 0 for odd (False). But again, that requires that the function returns bool, but how?\n\nBecause the expression (number&1)^1 is integer, so when the function returns it, the return type is int, but according to the function signature, we need to return a boolean. So, perhaps we can cast it to bool.\n\nSo, return bool( (number &1) ^ 1 )\n\nWait, but for even numbers, that would be bool(1) \u2192 True. For odd, bool(0) \u2192 False. So that works.\n\nSo which approach is better.\n\nLet me think about the initial problem statement: they mention that we can only use bitwise operators, perhaps that includes that comparison and others are acceptable but the condition is that we can't have if-else statements.\n\nThe first approach, return not(number &1) is perhaps the simplest and cleanest. It uses one bitwise AND and a logical NOT, which is allowed.\n\nSo perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nAnother way:\n\nBut perhaps the function can be written as return (number &1) == 0.\n\nYes, but that uses a comparison operator. The condition about what's allowed is unclear.\n\nThe problem says, \"without using if else statements. You can use bitwise operators only.\" So, perhaps I can use any other operations except for if-else statements. So, using a comparison is acceptable because it's not an if-else.\n\nWait, someone else may have this problem. Let me see: one way uses not and a bitwise operation, the other uses a comparison.\n\nAssuming that the intended solution uses bitwise operations only, and not relying on equality checks.\n\nWait, perhaps best to go back: the problem says to write the function without using if-else, and to use only bitwise operators. So for instance, not using == or !=, but only bitwise operations like & ^ | ~.\n\nWait, the term \"bitwise operators\" in programming generally refers to the operators that work on bits, like &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>.\n\nIn Python, expressions like (number & 1) evaluate to 0 or 1. So how can we turn that into True or False.\n\nBut, for the purposes of a boolean return, the 0 and non-zero already work as False and True, but we need to invert them.\n\nWait, if the number is even, the result is 0, so we want to return True. So, we need to convert 0 to True, and 1 to False.\n\nSo, how to do that with only bitwise operations.\n\nWait, another approach: using addition. 0 becomes -1 if I add -1 and then apply some operation, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about how to get 0 to become 1 and vice versa.\n\nLet me think: 0 in two's complement? Well, 0 XOR 1 is 1, and 1 XOR 1 is 0. So (number &1) XOR 1 gives 1 for even, 0 for odd.\n\nWait no:\n\n(number&1) is 0 for even, 1 for odd.\n\n0 XOR 1 is 1 \u2192 1 is non-zero, but in the context of return, but the function expects a boolean, so 1 is True.\n\nSo for even, (number&1) is 0 \u2192 XOR 1 is 1 \u2192 which is True.\n\nFor odd, (number&1) is 1 \u2192 XOR1 is 0 \u2192 which is False.\n\nSo yes, we can write return (number&1) ^1 as a function.\n\nWait, but (number&1) is 0 or 1 only if number is non-negative. Wait, but with negative numbers.\n\nWait, for -4: -4 in binary is ... in two's complement, which ends with 100.\n\nWait, but -4 is even. So -4&1 is 0. So (number&1) for -4 is 0, so XOR1 is 1 \u2192 True.\n\nTesting:\n\nnumber =-4. -4&1 is 0, 0^1=1. So return 1, which is treated as True.\n\nAnother test: number =-3.\n\n-3 is odd. -3 in binary is ...111 in two's complement, perhaps. So -3 &1 is 1? So 1^1 is0 \u2192 False.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo in code: return (number & 1) ^1.\n\nWait, but wait: when you write (number &1) ^1, that's an integer. The function expects a boolean return.\n\nBut in Python, if you return 1 or 0, the function expects you to have a boolean returns. So perhaps the function returns True or False.\n\nSo, is 1 considered True and 0 considered False?\n\nYes.\n\nWait, when (number&1) is 0, 0 ^1 is1 \u2192 return 1 \u2192 which is True.\n\nSo, in the function, is_even is defined to return a bool. So returning 1 would satisfy, because in Python, 1 is treated as True, 0 as False.\n\nBut when the function returns an integer, like 1, Python can return it, but the function is expecting a bool.\n\nSo is_evn(2) \u2192 returns 1 \u2192 True is returned.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps better to return a boolean.\n\nSo, perhaps returning bool( (number &1) ^ 1 )\n\nBut in that case, 0 is False, 1 is True.\n\nSo, the function will return True for even.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write:\n\nreturn (number & 1) ^1 != 0.\n\nBut that would return True for even.\n\nBut\n\nWait, (number &1) ^1: for even number, it becomes 1 \u2192 1 != 0 is True.\n\nFor odd, 0 \u2192 0 !=0 is False.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code can be: return ((number &1) ^1) !=0.\n\nWait, no. Because for even numbers, (number&1)^1 is 1, which is not equal to zero \u2192 returns True.\n\nYes. So this also works.\n\nBut perhaps using logical not is more efficient.\n\nWait, return not (number &1) is better because it directly inverts the 0 and 1, so is more straightforward.\n\nYes, that's the simplest: not (number&1).\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return not (number & 1)\n\nWhich works for all test cases.\n\nLet me review:\n\nnumber =2: 2&1=0 \u2192 not 0\u2192 True.\n\nnumber =3:3&1=1\u2192 not1\u2192False.\n\nnumber=0:0&1=0\u2192True.\n\nnumber=-4:-4&1=0\u2192True.\n\nnumber=-3:-3&1=1\u2192False.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the logic is solid.\n\nTherefore, the function can be written simply as return not (number &1).\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given integer is even or odd. The solution must be implemented without using if-else statements and should use bitwise operators.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach leverages the properties of binary numbers. Specifically, the least significant bit (LSB) of an integer determines if the number is even or odd:\n- If the LSB is 0, the number is even.\n- If the LSB is 1, the number is odd.\n\nUsing a bitwise AND operation with 1 (`number & 1`), we can isolate the LSB:\n- For even numbers, this operation results in 0.\n- For odd numbers, this operation results in 1.\n\nTo convert this result into a boolean value, we use logical negation (`not`). This changes the result so that 0 (false in a boolean context) becomes `True` and 1 (true in a boolean context) becomes `False`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return not (number & 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Bitwise AND Operation**: The operation `number & 1` isolates the least significant bit of the number. If the result is 0, the number is even; if the result is 1, the number is odd.\n2. **Logical Negation**: The logical `not` operator converts the result of the bitwise AND operation into a boolean value. Specifically, it converts 0 to `True` (indicating an even number) and 1 to `False` (indicating an odd number).\n\nThis approach is efficient and concise, utilizing bitwise operations to achieve the desired result without additional conditional statements.",
