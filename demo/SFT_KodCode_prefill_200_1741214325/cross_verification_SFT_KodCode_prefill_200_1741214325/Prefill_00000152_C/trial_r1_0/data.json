  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called is_even that determines whether a given number is even or odd. And the catch is, I can't use any if-else statements. Oh right, I can only use bitwise operators. Hmm, interesting.\n\nSo, how do I check if a number is even without using conditional statements? Let's think about the properties of even and odd numbers. An even number is divisible by 2, which means it has 0 as the remainder when divided by 2. In binary terms, the least significant bit (LSB) determines this. If the LSB is 0, the number is even; if it's 1, it's odd.\n\nOh right! So using bitwise operations, I can check the LSB. How? Well, using a bitwise AND. If I do number & 1, it will give me 0 for even numbers and 1 for odd. For example, 2 is 10 in binary, so 10 & 1 is 0. 3 is 11, so 11 & 1 is 1.\n\nSo the plan is to compute number & 1 and then return whether that result is 0. Because if it's 0, the number is even. But how to convert that into a boolean without using if-else?\n\nWait, in Python, 0 is considered False, and any non-zero is True. So if I take (number & 1), it will be 1 for odd and 0 for even. So, is there a way to invert or check this?\n\nWait, the function is_even should return True for even numbers. So I can compute number & 1, and if it's 0, then it's even, else odd. But without ifs, how do I return True or False based on that.\n\nWait, maybe using not? Or maybe using a boolean conversion. Oh, here's an idea: the expression (number & 1) will be 0 when even, else 1. So, if (number & 1) == 0, then return True else False. But how?\n\nWait, another approach: calculate whether (number & 1) is zero, which would mean even. But since I can't use conditionals, perhaps I can use a logical operation that converts this into a boolean directly. Like, take number & 1, and return not that it's equal to 1? But no, how to do that without an if.\n\nWait, another thought: in Python, 0 is the only value that's considered False in a boolean context. So for even numbers, the bitwise & with 1 gives 0, but when we take the boolean, it's False. Wait, but the function needs to return True for even. So I want the opposite.\n\nSo, perhaps the function can compute (number & 1) == 0. Wait, no: the == operator is allowed, but when I evaluate number & 1, it's 0 for even. So (number & 1) == 0 is a boolean expression.\n\nWait, but is that allowed? Like, number is an integer. So number & 1 is an integer. Comparing that to 0 will be a boolean.\n\nWait wait, in Python, the == operator returns a boolean, True or False. So, for is_even, I can return (number & 1) == 0.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 2. 2 & 1 is 0. So 0 == 0 \u2192 True.\nSample 2: 3. 3 & 1 is 1 \u2192 1 == 0? No, so it returns False.\nSample 3: 0 \u2192 0 & 1 is 0 \u2192 returns True.\nSample 4: -4. Let's see, -4 in binary is ... well, in two's complement, but when you & with 1, it's 0 because the last bit is 0. So it's even.\nWait wait, in Python, the & operator works for negative numbers too. So how does it handle it?\n\nPython uses infinite-precision integers, so for negative numbers in two's complement, the least significant bit will be 0 for even and 1 for odd.\n\nTesting -3: binary is ...11111101, so last bit is 1. So -3&1 \u21921, so returns False.\n\nSo for all test cases, the logic works.\n\nSo the function can be written as: return (number & 1) == 0\n\nWait, but this uses a comparison, which is allowed. Wait, yeah, because I'm not using if-else statements. So that should be fine.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nThe function will be:\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return (number & 1) == 0\n\nAlternatively, since 0 is treated as False and any non-zero as True, another approach is to return not (number & 1). Because when number is even, number & 1 is 0; not 0 is True. When odd, it's 1, not 1 is False. So that's another way: return not (number & 1).\n\nWait, does that work?\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor 2: 2&1 is 0 \u2192 not 0 \u2192 True.\n\n3: 1 \u2192 not 1 \u2192 False.\n\n0 \u2192 0 \u2192 not \u2192 True.\n\n-4: 0 \u2192 True.\n\n-3: 1 \u2192 False.\n\nSo yes, that works.\n\nSo the function can be simplified to return not (number & 1).\n\nWhich is more efficient? Probably similar, but the second is more concise.\n\nWhich way is better to write it? Both should be correct.\n\nSo which version is better? The user said to use bitwise operators only, so perhaps the first uses a bitwise operator and equality, but the second uses bitwise and not.\n\nBoth are valid, but the second is more concise and perhaps uses only bitwise and boolean operations without using explicit conditionals.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    return not (number & 1)\n\nWait, let's test with all sample cases.\n\nSample 1: 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 not \u2192 True \u2705\nSample 2:3 \u21921 \u2192 not \u2192False \u2705\nSample3:0\u21920\u2192True \u2705\nSample4:-4\u21920\u2192True \u2705\nSample5:-3\u21921\u2192False \u2705\n\nYes, it works.\n\nSo the function can be written as a one-liner using not and the bitwise & with 1.\n\nSo I think either approach is correct, but using not is cleaner.\n\nOkay, so I will choose the second approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given integer is even or odd without using if-else statements. Instead, we will use bitwise operations to achieve this.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight into solving this problem lies in understanding the binary representation of numbers. Specifically, the least significant bit (LSB) of a number determines if it is even or odd:\n- If the LSB is 0, the number is even.\n- If the LSB is 1, the number is odd.\n\nUsing the bitwise AND operator `&`, we can check the value of the LSB. For any integer `number`, the expression `number & 1` will yield 0 if the number is even and 1 if the number is odd. We can then use the logical NOT operator `not` to convert this result into a boolean value, where 0 becomes `True` and 1 becomes `False`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_even(number: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Determine if a number is even using bitwise operators.\"\"\"\n    return not (number & 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The function `is_even` takes an integer `number` as input.\n- The expression `number & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation between `number` and 1, extracting the LSB.\n- Using `not` on the result of `number & 1` converts 0 to `True` and 1 to `False`.\n- Thus, the function returns `True` if `number` is even and `False` if `number` is odd.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the parity of the number using bitwise operations, adhering to the constraint of not using if-else statements.",
