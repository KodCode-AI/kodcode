  "r1_response": "<think>\nTo count the trailing zeros in a given number, I can use the mathematical property that the number of trailing zeros in a number equals the number of times 10 is a factor in that number.\n\nSince 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I'll count the number of times 2 and 5 are factors in the number. The minimum of these two counts will give the number of trailing zeros.\n\nI'll create a function to count the occurrences of a specific factor in the number. Then, I'll use this helper function to count both 2s and 5s and return the smaller count as the result.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in a given number, we can leverage the mathematical property that any number trailing zeros are produced by the factors of 10 in that number. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), trailing zeros are created by pairs of 2 and 5 in the number's prime factorization. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count of these two factors.\n\nLet's follow the step-by-step solution below:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to count how many times the number can be divided by 10, which translates to finding the minimum number of times the number can be divided by 2 and by 5.\n\n2. **Factor Counting**: We'll create a helper function to count how many times a number can be divided by a specified factor (in this case, 2 and 5).\n\n3. **Calculate Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros will be the minimum value between the counts of 2 and 5.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    def count_factor(n, factor):\n        count = 0\n        while n % factor == 0 and n != 0:\n            count += 1\n            n = n // factor\n        return count\n    \n    count_2 = count_factor(n, 2)\n    count_5 = count_factor(n, 5)\n    \n    return min(count_2, count_5)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(count_trailing_zeros(100))  # Output: 2\nprint(count_trailing_zeros(1000))  # Output: 3\nprint(count_trailing_zeros(5))     # Output: 1\nprint(count_trailing_zeros(8))     # Output: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n- **Helper Function (`count_factor`)**:\n  - This function takes two arguments: the number `n` and a `factor` (which will be 2 and 5 in our case).\n  - It repeatedly divides `n` by the `factor` while `n` is divisible by the `factor`, counting each successful division.\n  - The loop continues until `n` is no longer divisible by the `factor` or `n` becomes 0.\n\n- **Main Function (`count_trailing_zeros`)**:\n  - It uses `count_factor` to determine how many times the given number `n` can be divided by 2 and by 5.\n  - The minimum of these two counts is returned as the number of trailing zeros.\n\n- **Examples**:\n  - For `n = 100`, the counts are 2 for both 2 and 5, resulting in 2 trailing zeros.\n  - For `n = 1000`, the counts are 3 for both 2 and 5, resulting in 3 trailing zeros.\n  - For `n = 5`, the count for 2 is 0 and for 5 is 1, resulting in 1 trailing zero.\n  - For `n = 8`, the count for 2 is 3 and for 5 is 0, resulting in 0 trailing zeros.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the trailing zeros by focusing on the necessary prime factors, ensuring optimal performance.",
