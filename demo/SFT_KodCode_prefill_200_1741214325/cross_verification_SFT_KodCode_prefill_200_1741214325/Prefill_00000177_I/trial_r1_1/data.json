  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to sort an array using the Quick Sort algorithm. Hmm, Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, right? So, I remember that the basic idea is to pick a pivot element and then partition the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. Then, recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays.\n\nFirst, I should think about the base case for the recursion. If the array has zero or one element, it's already sorted, so I can just return it as is.\n\nNext, choosing the pivot. I think in some implementations, the last element is chosen as the pivot. Or sometimes the middle element. Maybe for simplicity, I'll pick the last element as the pivot.\n\nSo, I need to create three lists: elements less than pivot, equal to pivot, and greater than pivot. Wait, but I might not have duplicates, but it's safer to handle them by including an equal part in case there are duplicates.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. If the length of the array is 0 or 1, return the array.\n2. Select the pivot (maybe last element, arr[-1]).\n3. Create three lists: left, middle, right.\n4. Iterate through each element in the array:\n   a. If the element is less than pivot, add to left.\n   b. If equal, add to middle.\n   c. If greater, add to right.\n5. Then, recursively sort the left and right lists.\n6. Combine the sorted left, middle, and sorted right to form the final sorted array.\n\nWait, but sometimes the pivot selection can affect performance. Like, if the array is already sorted, picking the last element each time could lead to O(n^2) time. But for the purpose of this function, maybe it's acceptable since it's a basic implementation.\n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nThe function will be called quick_sort, taking arr as an argument.\n\nInside the function, first the base case:\nif len(arr) <= 1:\n    return arr\n\nThen pick pivot as last element:\npivot = arr[-1]\n\nThen create left, middle, right:\nleft = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\nWait, no, wait: arr is the original array, but the pivot is the last element, so to avoid including the pivot in the left, maybe I should loop through all elements, not just arr[:-1]. Wait, no, the last element is the pivot, so when looping through arr, I can include all elements except the pivot when creating left, middle, right.\n\nWait no, perhaps a better approach is to consider all elements, including the pivot. But since the pivot is included, during the iteration, the pivot itself will go into the middle list. So the code can be:\n\nleft = []\nmiddle = []\nright = []\nfor num in arr:\n    if num < pivot:\n        left.append(num)\n    elif num == pivot:\n        middle.append(num)\n    else:\n        right.append(num)\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nThen, recursively sort the left and right:\nsorted_left = quick_sort(left)\nsorted_right = quick_sort(right)\n\nFinally, concatenate the sorted left, middle, and sorted right:\nreturn sorted_left + middle + sorted_right\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    middle = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        elif num == pivot:\n            middle.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\nWait, but what about if the array is empty? Well, len(arr) <=1 covers 0 as well.\n\nTesting this function with an example. Let's say arr = [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]. \n\nWait, when I run it:\n\npivot is 1. Then, left will be elements less than 1, which is none (since 1 is the smallest). Middle will include all 1s. Right will include the rest. Then, in the recursive step, sorting the right, which includes [3,6,8,10,2]. Then, each recursive call will handle that.\n\nAnother test case: arr = [5,1,3,2,4]. Pivot is 4. Left is [5,1,3,2], right is empty. Wait, no, because 5,1,3,2 are less than 4? Wait no, arr is [5,1,3,2,4], so the pivot is 4. So 5 is greater than 4, so it goes to right. Wait, no, wait: 5 is greater than 4, so in the loop, for num in arr, which is 5,1,3,2,4.\n\nSo first num is 5: since 5>4, add to right.\nSecond num is 1: <4, add to left.\nThird num is 3: <4, add to left.\nFourth num is 2: <4, add to left.\nFifth num is 4: equal to pivot, add to middle.\n\nSo left is [1,3,2], right is [5], middle is [4].\n\nThen, recursively sort left [1,3,2]. Let's see: the next function call, the pivot is 2. Then elements are 1 (less), 3 (greater, since 3>2), so left is [1], right is [3], middle is [2]. So recursive call sorts left [1] which is base case, returns [1], and sorts right [3], which returns [3]. So for the left [1,3,2], it becomes [1]+[2]+[3] = [1,2,3]. Then, middle is [4], right is [5], which is sorted already, so the final array is [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: empty array. Let's see, function returns empty, correct.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? For example, arr = [ -3, 1, 0, -2 ]. Pivot is -2. Check each element:\n\n-3: less than -2, goes to left.\n1: greater, right.\n0: greater than -2 (since 0 > -2), right.\n-2: equal, middle.\n\nSo left is [ -3 ], middle is [ -2 ], right is [1,0].\n\nSorting left returns [-3]. Sorting right: [0,1]. Wait, no: in the next recursive call, right is [1,0], with pivot 0.\n\nFor [1,0]:\n\npivot is 0. So elements: 1>0: right is [1], 0: middle [0]. So left is empty.\n\nSo sorted left is empty, middle [0], right is [1]. So [0,1]. So the final array is [-3, -2, 0,1]. Correct.\n\nSo the function seems to handle these cases.\n\nWait, but in the case when all elements are the same. Like arr = [5,5,5,5]. Then, in each step, middle will collect all of them, and left and right are empty, so the function returns the same array, which is correct.\n\nThus, the function seems to handle various cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the Quick Sort algorithm in Python. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around this pivot. The pivot is chosen such that elements less than the pivot go to one side, elements greater than the pivot go to the other side, and elements equal to the pivot are in the middle. This process is then recursively applied to the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case Handling**: If the array has zero or one element, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: For simplicity, we choose the last element of the array as the pivot.\n3. **Partitioning**: Create three lists:\n   - `left`: Elements less than the pivot.\n   - `middle`: Elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `right`: Elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply Quick Sort to the `left` and `right` sub-arrays.\n5. **Combine Results**: Concatenate the sorted `left`, `middle`, and sorted `right` to form the final sorted array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    middle = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        elif num == pivot:\n            middle.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case**: The function immediately returns the array if its length is 0 or 1.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: The pivot is chosen as the last element of the array to simplify the implementation.\n3. **Partitioning**: The array is iterated through once, and each element is placed into `left`, `middle`, or `right` based on its comparison to the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: The `quick_sort` function is called recursively on the `left` and `right` sub-arrays.\n5. **Combining Results**: The sorted `left` sub-array is concatenated with `middle` (which contains all occurrences of the pivot) and the sorted `right` sub-array to produce the final sorted array.\n\nThis approach ensures that the array is divided and sorted efficiently, leveraging the divide-and-conquer strategy inherent in Quick Sort. The average-case time complexity is O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets, though it can be O(n^2) in the worst case if the pivot is chosen unstably. For the purpose of this implementation, we have used a simple pivot selection strategy, which works well for general cases.",
