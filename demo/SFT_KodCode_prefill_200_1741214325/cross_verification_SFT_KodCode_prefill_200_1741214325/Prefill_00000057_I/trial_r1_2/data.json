  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that counts the number of uppercase letters in a given string. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. So, the function should handle edge cases like empty strings or strings with no uppercase letters.\n\nFirst, I should start by initializing a counter variable to zero. That makes sense because if there are no uppercase letters, it should return zero, and it's also good for the empty string case.\n\nNext, I need to loop through each character in the input string. For each character, I'll check if it's uppercase. How do I check that in Python? Oh right, there's a string method called isupper() which returns True if the character is uppercase. So I can use that.\n\nSo the plan is: iterate over each character, if it's uppercase, increment the counter. After processing all characters, return the counter.\n\nLet me think about some test cases. If the string is empty, the loop won't run, so the counter remains zero, which is correct. If the string has no uppercase letters, same result. If there are uppercase letters, they should be counted.\n\nWait, what about non-alphabetic characters? Like numbers or symbols. Since isupper() returns False for them, they won't affect the count. That's fine, we only care about uppercase letters.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function will take a string as input, initialize a counter to zero, loop through each character, check if it's uppercase, and if so, add to the counter. Then return the counter.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Define the function, take the string as an argument. Initialize count to zero. For loop: for char in string. If char.isupper(), then count +=1. After the loop, return count.\n\nI think that's all. It should handle all cases, including edge ones.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that counts the number of uppercase letters in a given string. The function should handle edge cases such as an empty string or a string with no uppercase letters.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start by initializing a counter variable to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of uppercase letters encountered.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Character**: Loop through each character in the input string.\n3. **Check for Uppercase Letters**: For each character, use the `isupper()` method to check if it is an uppercase letter.\n4. **Update the Counter**: If a character is uppercase, increment the counter.\n5. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, return the counter value.\n\nThis approach ensures that all characters are checked, and only the uppercase letters are counted. The function handles edge cases efficiently because it correctly returns zero for an empty string or a string with no uppercase letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef count_uppercase_letters(input_string):\n    count = 0\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char.isupper():\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing a counter `count` to zero.\n- **Loop Through Characters**: It then iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.\n- **Check Uppercase**: For each character, the `isupper()` method is used to check if the character is uppercase. This method returns `True` if the character is uppercase, prompting the counter to be incremented.\n- **Return Count**: After all characters have been checked, the function returns the count, which represents the number of uppercase letters in the input string.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all specified cases, including strings with no uppercase letters or an empty string, ensuring correct results in all scenarios.",
