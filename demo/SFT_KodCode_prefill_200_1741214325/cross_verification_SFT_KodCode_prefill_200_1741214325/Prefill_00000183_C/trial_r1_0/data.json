  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called reverse_string that takes a string and returns it reversed. Hmm, let's think about how to do this. So, for example, if the input is \"hello\", the output should be \"olleh\". \n\nWait, how do you reverse a string in Python? I remember that strings have slicing capabilities. Oh right, you can slice them with steps. Like, to reverse, you can slice from the end to the beginning with a step of -1. So s[::-1] would reverse the string.\n\nSo maybe the function can just return s[::-1]. Let me think about that. Let's test this logic with some examples.\n\nIf s is \"hello\", s[::-1] is \"olleh\" which is correct. For \"Python\", it would be \"nohtyP\", right. What about empty string or single character? Yeah, they should just return as is, which they do with this approach. \n\nSo the function is pretty straightforward. I can write it like this. Wait, are there other ways? Like using reversed() and then joining? Because reversed returns an iterator, so maybe ''.join(reversed(s)) is another method. But the slicing is more concise. \n\nI think using s[::-1] is the simplest solution here. So the function body can just be return s[::-1]. Let's see the doctests provided. They have several cases including an empty string and a single character, which this solution should handle fine.\n\nSo I'll write the function as def reverse_string(s: str) -> str: return s[::-1]. That should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. This is a common task and can be efficiently achieved using Python's string slicing capabilities.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem leverages Python's string slicing feature. By slicing the string from the end to the beginning with a step of -1, we can easily reverse the string. This is done using the slicing syntax `s[::-1]`, where `s` is the input string. This method is concise and efficient, as it directly reverses the string in one step without needing additional functions or loops.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Write a python function to reverse a string.\"\"\"\n    return s[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `reverse_string` takes a string `s` as input. By using the slicing syntax `s[::-1]`, we create a new string that is the reverse of `s`. The slicing operation starts from the end of the string and moves backwards, effectively reversing the string. This approach handles all edge cases, including empty strings and single-character strings, by simply returning the input as is when reversed. The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, as slicing in Python creates a new string in linear time.",
