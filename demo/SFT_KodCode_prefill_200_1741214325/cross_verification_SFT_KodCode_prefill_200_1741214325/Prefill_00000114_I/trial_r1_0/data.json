  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to check if a given number is a prime number. Hmm, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the function should return True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.\n\nFirst, let me think about the steps involved. For a number 'n', I need to determine if it's prime. Here's what I should do:\n\n1. Handle the edge cases. If the number is less than 2, it's not prime. So I can immediately return False for numbers less than 2.\n2. For numbers 2 and above, I need to check for factors other than 1 and n.\n3. A common method is to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n. If any number in this range divides n evenly, then n is not prime. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n\nWait, right, because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so checking up to sqrt(n) is efficient.\n\nSo, how do I implement this?\n\nFirst, the function will take an integer as input. Let's call it 'num'.\n\nIf num is less than 2, return False.\n\nIf num is 2, return True because 2 is the smallest prime.\n\nFor numbers greater than 2, loop from 2 up to the square root of num (inclusive?), and check if any of them divide num without a remainder. If yes, return False. If none do, return True.\n\nWait, wait, how do I calculate the square root? Using the math module's sqrt function, but that returns a float. So I should convert it to an integer. Also, I should loop up to and including the integer part of the square root.\n\nIn code:\n\nImport math.\n\nFor i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1). Hmm, wait, in Python 3, range is exclusive of the end, so adding 1 will include the integer part.\n\nLet me think about even numbers. Suppose num is even, then it's not a prime unless num is 2. So maybe I can add a quick check for even numbers first.\n\nBut perhaps it's not necessary because the loop will catch it when i=2. So the function would check whether num is even, return False if it is and greater than 2.\n\nAlternatively, adding that as a first check might speed things up because the loop can be skipped for even numbers greater than 2.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nIf num < 2: return False\n\nIf num == 2: return True\n\nIf num is even: return False\n\nThen, check from 3 up to sqrt(num), in steps of 2, because even numbers are already handled.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\nAfter handling the even numbers, I can start checking from 3 and increment by 2 each time, which would only check odd numbers. Because any even number would have been caught already.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n\n    if num < 2:\n\n        return False\n\n    if num == 2:\n\n        return True\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_divisor = math.sqrt(num)\n\n    # Start from 3, check up to sqrt(num), step by 2\n\n    for i in range(3, int(max_divisor) + 1, 2):\n\n        if num % i == 0:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, but in Python, the range goes up to but not including the end. So to include the integer value of sqrt(num), we have to add 1 to the integer.\n\nFor example, sqrt(25) is 5, so adding 1, range would go from 3 to 6, i.e., 5 steps (3,4,5).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nmath.sqrt(25) is 5.0, so int(5.0) is 5.\n\nrange is 3, up to 5+1 =6, so the numbers would be 3,4,5, but wait, wait, let's see:\n\nrange(3,6,2) gives 3,5. Because 3 is the start, and each step is +2: 3, 5, then next would be 7 which is beyond 6.\n\nWait, so if the max_divisor is 5, and I need to include 5 as the upper limit?\n\nBut using range(3, 6, 2) would only include 3,5. So in the case of 25, it would check 3, but not 5?\n\nWait, but wait, for num=25, the square root is 5.0. So I need to include i=5 as a possible divisor.\n\nBut in the code as written, it's in the range up to and including 5. Hmm, no:\n\nWait, if max_divisor is 5, then range is 3 to (5+1)=6, but step is 2, so 3,5 are included.\n\nWait, 5 is included because 3,5 <6.\n\nSo for 25:\n\ni=3: 25%3 is 1, not zero.\n\ni=5: 25%5 is 0, so returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 49 is 7 squared.\n\nsqrt(49) =7, so max_divisor is 7.\n\nrange(3, 8, 2) includes 3,5,7.\n\ni=7 divides 49, so returns False. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: 9.\n\nnum=9.\n\nmax_divisor=3. So range(3,4,2) gives 3.\n\nCheck 9%3, which is 0, returns False. Correct.\n\nWait, what about 15:\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.872, so int is 3.\n\nBut 15%3 ==0, so returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother test: num=7.\n\nsqrt(7)=2.645..., so int is 2.\n\nSo the loop is from 3 up to (int(2.645)+1)= 3+1=3? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, max_divisor for num=7 is math.sqrt(7) ~ 2.645, int(max_divisor)=2.\n\nSo the loop is from 3 to (2 + 1)=3? No, because then the range is 3 to 3, which would not execute the loop. Because range in Python is up to, but not including, the end.\n\nWait, for i in range(3, 3, 2), that produces an empty sequence.\n\nSo in the case of num=7, the loop would not execute, and the function would return True, which is correct.\n\nWait, correct, because 3>2.645, so the loop doesn't run.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see with num=5.\n\nsqrt(5)=2.236, int is 2. So the loop is from 3 to (2+1)=3, which doesn't run, returns True. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: num=4.\n\nIt's even, returns False.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother case: num=3.\n\nnum>2, not even. sqrt(3)=1.732, int is 1.\n\nLoop is from 3 to (1+1)=2, which doesn't run. Hence returns True.\n\nBut wait, the sqrt(3) is 1.732, meaning any factors have to be up to 2, but 3 is less than 2. So no factors; thus, returns True.\n\nWait, 3 is a prime.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the code, after handling 2 and even numbers, the function proceeds.\n\nWait, okay, another test: num=21.\n\nmax_divisor is sqrt(21)~4.583. int is 4.\n\nLoop: starts at 3, steps by 2:3,5.\n\nBut 21's sqrt is less than 5, so 3 and 5.\n\nWait, 21%3 is 0, so i=3 returns false.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWhat about 13?\n\nsqrt(13)=3.605, so max_divisor is 3.\n\nLoop runs from 3 to 4 (since 3 +1=4), step 2.\n\nSo i=3.\n\n13%3 is 1, so loop continues.\n\nNo divisors, returns True. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nI think this code should work.\n\nBut I should think about what happens if num is 1: returns false. num=0: false. num=-3: false.\n\nWhat about non-integer inputs? For example, a float like 5.0.\n\nWell, the function is supposed to take a number. But for non-integer numbers, being prime isn't usually considered, but the function as written would check.\n\nFor example, 4.0 would return False, but 5.0 would pass the loop and return True, which is incorrect because 5.0 is a float and primes are defined for integers. So perhaps the function should first check if num is an integer.\n\nHmm, the problem says \"given number\", but the function is meant to determine if it's a prime. So perhaps the function should return False if num is not an integer.\n\nSo, adding:\n\nif not isinstance(num, int):\n\n    return False\n\nBut, wait, if someone passes 7.0, which is mathematically an integer float, should the function treat it as 7 and return True, or return False because it's a float?\n\nI think the standard approach is that a prime number is defined on integers greater than 1. So perhaps in the function, if num is not an integer, return False.\n\nSo, perhaps adding a condition at the beginning.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n\n    if not isinstance(num, int):\n\n        return False\n\n    if num < 2:\n\n        return False\n\n    if num == 2:\n\n        return True\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_divisor = math.sqrt(num)\n\n    for i in range(3, int(max_divisor) + 1, 2):\n\n        if num % i == 0:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nThis way, non-integer inputs are rejected.\n\nWait, but what about num being a boolean, like True or False?\n\nBecause in Python, True is 1 and False is 0, and isinstance(True, int) is True.\n\nSo True is 1, so is_prime(True) would return False, correct.\n\nSimilarly, is_prime(False) is same as 0, returns False.\n\nSo I think that condition is okay.\n\nSo this function should correctly handle integer and non-integer inputs.\n\nAnother test case: num=1.\n\nFunction returns False. Correct.\n\nWhat about num=3, returns True.\n\nnum=4, returns False.\n\nnum=7, returns True.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo perhaps this is a solid function.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a given number is a prime number, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check for Non-Integer Inputs**: Prime numbers are defined on integers, so if the input is not an integer, return False.\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Numbers less than 2 are not prime. Additionally, 2 is the smallest prime number.\n3. **Check for Even Numbers**: Any even number greater than 2 is not prime.\n4. **Test for Divisors**: For numbers greater than 2 and odd, check for divisors from 3 up to the square root of the number, incrementing by 2 to skip even numbers.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing these steps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if not isinstance(num, int):\n        return False\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    if num == 2:\n        return True\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    max_divisor = math.sqrt(num)\n    for i in range(3, int(max_divisor) + 1, 2):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- `is_prime(7)` returns `True` because 7 is a prime number.\n- `is_prime(8)` returns `False` because 8 is not a prime number.\n- `is_prime(2)` returns `True` as 2 is the smallest prime number.\n- `is_prime(1)` returns `False` because 1 is not a prime number.\n- `is_prime(15)` returns `False` because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5.\n- `is_prime(4)` returns `False` because 4 is an even number greater than 2.\n\nThis function efficiently checks for prime numbers by minimizing the number of divisibility tests, ensuring optimal performance even for larger numbers.",
