  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to determine if a given number is a prime number. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the function should return True if the number is prime, otherwise False.\n\nLet me think about the steps. First, I should handle edge cases. What if the number is less than 2? Then it's definitely not prime. So if n is less than 2, return False.\n\nNext, for numbers 2 and above. Wait, 2 is a prime number, right? So if n is 2, I should return True. What about even numbers greater than 2? They're not prime because they're divisible by 2. So I can check if n is even and greater than 2, return False.\n\nNow, for other numbers. I need to check if n has any divisors other than 1 and itself. How do I efficiently do that? The naive approach is to try dividing n by all numbers from 2 up to n-1. But that's inefficient for large numbers.\n\nWait, a better approach is to check up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root. So checking up to sqrt(n) is sufficient.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n1. If n <= 1, return False.\n2. If n == 2, return True.\n3. If n is even, return False.\n4. Check for factors from 3 up to sqrt(n), stepping by 2 (to skip even numbers).\n5. If any factor divides n evenly, return False.\n6. If no factors found, return True.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nFirst, function is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    Now, loop from 3 to sqrt(n) + 1, step 2.\n    For i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, how to compute sqrt(n) in Python? I can use math.sqrt(n), but I need to import math. Oh, but for the loop, I can calculate it once before the loop starts.\n\nAlso, since range takes integers, I'll convert the sqrt to an integer. Hmm, let's see. For example, sqrt(25) is 5.0, so adding 1 makes it 6, but the loop goes up to but not including 6, so it would check 3,5 in this case, which is correct since 5 is a factor.\n\nBut wait, let's think about whether using float would be an issue. Maybe it's better to cast it to an integer. Maybe using int(math.sqrt(n)) +1.\n\nWait, math.sqrt returns a float, so when I cast to int, it truncates. So for n=25, math.sqrt is 5.0, int is 5, plus 1 is 6. So the loop will go from 3 to 6, which is up to 5, inclusive. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but range is exclusive on the upper bound. So the code would be: range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1, 2). That way, it includes all numbers up to sqrt(n).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to loop while i*i <= n, which might save a bit of computation time, especially for large n.\n\nSo perhaps, the loop can be written with a while loop:\n\ni = 3\nwhile i * i <= n:\n    if n % i == 0:\n        return False\n    i += 2\n\nWait, then we don't need to compute sqrt(n) and convert it, which might be faster.\n\nI think the while loop approach is more efficient, especially for very large numbers. Let's consider that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    max_divisor = math.sqrt(n)\n    for i in range(3, int(max_divisor) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nBut wait, maybe just use the while loop without math. Let me think. Alternatively, I can compute i from 3, increment by 2, and while i*i <=n.\n\nSo, code would be:\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nThis approach avoids importing math, which is better for efficiency and keeping the function self-contained.\n\nWait, for n=9, the loop will check i=3, 3^2=9 <=9, and then n%i is 0, so returns False. Correct.\n\nWait, for n=3, the loop doesn't run because 3*3=9 is greater than 3, so returns True. Correct.\n\nWait, for n=4, it's even, so returns False after the third condition.\n\nWhat about n=25? The loop starts at 3, 3*3=9<=25, check 25%3 is 1, not 0. Then i becomes 5. 5*5=25 <=25, 25%5 is 0, returns False.\n\nSo that works.\n\nThis approach seems solid. Let's think about possible test cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1 -> False.\n\nTest case 2: n=2 -> True.\n\nTest case 3: n=3 -> True.\n\nTest case 4: n=4 -> False.\n\nTest case 5: n=5 -> True.\n\nTest case 6: n=6 -> False.\n\nTest case 7: n=7 -> True.\n\nTest case 8: n=9 -> False.\n\nTest case 9: n=11 -> True.\n\nTest case 10: n=15 (divisible by 3 and 5) -> False.\n\nAll these should be handled correctly.\n\nI think that's a good approach. So the function without using math is better as it's more efficient and avoids the math library. So I'll go with the while loop approach.\n\nSo the function is_prime(n) would be as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a given number is a prime number, we can use an efficient algorithm that checks potential factors up to the square root of the number. This approach helps in reducing the number of checks, making the function more efficient, especially for larger numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Non-Prime Cases**:\n   - If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.\n   - If the number is exactly 2, it is prime.\n   - If the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.\n\n2. **Check for Odd Factors**:\n   - Start checking from 3, and increment by 2 to skip even numbers.\n   - Continue checking factors up to the square root of the number. If any factor divides the number evenly, it is not a prime.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**:\n   - For numbers less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False` immediately as they are not prime.\n   - The number 2 is the smallest prime number, so the function returns `True` if `n` is 2.\n   - Any even number greater than 2 is not prime, so the function returns `False` in such cases.\n\n2. **Odd Factor Check**:\n   - The function starts checking for factors from 3 onwards, incrementing by 2 to skip even numbers, which are already handled.\n   - By checking up to the square root of `n`, the function efficiently determines if `n` has any factors other than 1 and itself.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for larger values of `n` by minimizing the number of divisibility checks.",
