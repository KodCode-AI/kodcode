  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to reverse a linked list in place. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a linked list is composed of nodes. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node. To reverse the list, I need to change the next pointers so that each node points to the previous one instead of the next.\n\nSo, I'll start by considering the node structure. I think each node should have a 'val' attribute for the data and a 'next' attribute pointing to the next node. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the function needs to take the head of the list as input and return the new head after reversal. Since this is an in-place reversal, I shouldn't create new nodes; I'll just rearrange the pointers.\n\nHmm, how do I do that without getting lost? Maybe I can use a iterative approach with three pointers: previous, current, and next. That way, I can keep track of the nodes as I reverse the links.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize three pointers: previous as None, current as the head, and next as None.\n2. While current is not None, do the following:\n   a. Store the next node in a temporary variable (next = current.next).\n   b. Reverse the link: current.next = previous.\n   c. Move previous and current one step forward: previous = current, current = next.\n3. After the loop, the new head will be the last node we processed, which is 'previous'.\n\nWait, but what about the initial case where the list is empty? The function should return None in that case. Or if the list has only one node, it just returns the same head.\n\nLet me test the logic with a small example. Suppose the list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None.\n\n- Initialization: previous = None, current = head (1), next = None.\n- First iteration: next = 2. current.next = None. So 1's next is None. Then previous becomes 1, current becomes 2.\n- Second iteration: next = 3. current.next = 1. Previous becomes 2, current becomes 3.\n- Third iteration: next = None. current.next = 2. Previous becomes 3, current becomes None. Loop ends.\n- The new head is 3, so the list is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None, which is correct.\n\nOkay, that seems solid. So in the code, I'll start with the function definition, then handle these pointers.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the original head's next is set correctly to prevent losing the list, but since current is moving step by step, and each next is stored before changing the link, it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nNow, about the code structure. I'll write a Node class first, just in case, but the function might not need it if it's already provided. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps including a simple Node class for clarity is good.\n\nWait, actually, the function itself doesn't require the Node class, it just manipulates the head node. But when creating nodes for testing, I need the Node class.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has their own Node class. Anyway, for the function, as long as each node has a next attribute, it should work.\n\nSo the function will be:\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head):\n\n    # Initialize pointers\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n\n    # After loop, prev is the new head\n    return prev\n\nWait, let me see... If the head is None, the function returns None, which is correct. If head is a single node, current will be the same, loop runs once, current.next becomes None, then prev becomes that node, which is the new head.\n\nTesting this should work.\n\nBut wait, is this in-place? Yes, because we're not creating any new nodes, just changing the next pointers.\n\nI think this should solve the problem. Now, I can write this as the formal answer.\n</think>\n\nTo reverse a linked list in place, we can use an iterative approach with three pointers to efficiently change the direction of the node links without requiring additional space for new nodes.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** Start with three pointers: `previous` set to `None`, `current` set to the head of the list, and `next_node` used to store the next node temporarily.\n2. **Iteration:** Traverse through the list while `current` is not `None`.\n   - Store the next node in `next_node` before changing the `current` node's next pointer.\n   - Reverse the link by setting `current.next` to `previous`.\n   - Move `previous` and `current` one step forward by updating `previous` to `current` and `current` to `next_node`.\n3. **Completion:** Once the loop ends, `previous` will point to the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis method ensures that the reversal is done in place with O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the list.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Node Class:** Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, containing a value and a reference to the next node.\n- **reverse_linked_list Function:** \n  - Initializes pointers to traverse and reverse the list.\n  - Loops through each node, reversing the `next` pointer to point to the previous node.\n  - Returns the new head of the reversed list.\n\nBy following this approach, we efficiently reverse the linked list in place, ensuring optimal performance and space usage.",
