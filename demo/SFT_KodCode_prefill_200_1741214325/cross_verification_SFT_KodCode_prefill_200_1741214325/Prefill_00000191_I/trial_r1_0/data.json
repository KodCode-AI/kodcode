  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to reverse a linked list in place. Hmm, I remember that reversing a linked list involves changing the pointers of each node so that they point to the previous node instead of the next. But how exactly do I do that?\n\nWait, let me think about the structure of a singly linked list. Each node has a value and a 'next' pointer. To reverse it, I think I need to go through each node and make the 'next' point backward. But how do I keep track of the previous node while doing this?\n\nMaybe I can initialize three pointers: previous, current, and next. Oh right, because current node's next pointer will be overwritten, so I need to save the next node before changing current's next.\n\nSo, the steps I think are:\n\n1. Initialize previous to None, current to the head of the list.\n2. While current is not None:\n   a. Save the next node (next_node = current.next)\n   b. Set current.next to previous (this reverses the link)\n   c. Move previous and current one step forward. So previous becomes current, current becomes next_node.\n3. After the loop, the new head should be the last node, but wait, no. Wait, actually, when we start, previous is None, current is head. After the first iteration, current's next becomes None, so the head now points to None, but that's the end of the reversed list. So the new head is the last node, which is the original last node which now points to the previous nodes.\n\nSo after the loop, the new head is 'current', no wait, wait. Wait, let's see with an example.\n\nSuppose list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None.\n\nFirst iteration:\nprevious = None, current = 1.\nnext_node = 2.\ncurrent.next = previous => 1.next = None.\nprevious becomes current (1), current becomes next_node (2).\n\nSecond iteration:\nprevious =1, current=2.\nnext_node=3.\ncurrent.next =1. So 2's next points to 1.\nprevious becomes 2, current becomes 3.\n\nThird iteration:\nprevious=2, current=3.\nnext_node=None.\ncurrent.next=2. So 3's next is 2.\nprevious becomes3, current becomes None. Loop ends.\n\nSo the new head should be the node that was the last node, which is 3, pointing to 2, which points to 1.\n\nBut in this process, the variable 'current' ends up as None, but 'previous' ends up as 3, which is the new head. Ah! So the new head is previous. So when the loop finishes, the head should be previous.\n\nSo the function needs to take the head as an argument, and return the new head.\n\nWait, but in Python, if the function is called, for example, with head = None (empty list), it should return None. Same for one-node list, it returns the same node.\n\nSo, putting this into code.\n\nI think the function will look like this:\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head):\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n\nWait, yes. Because when current is None, the loop ends, and prev is the last node, which is the new head.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example.\n\nExample 1: head is 1 -> 2 ->3.\n\ninitial prev is None, current is 1.\n\nIteration 1:\nnext_node = 2\ncurrent.next = None\nprev becomes 1\ncurrent becomes 2.\n\nIteration 2:\nnext_node=3\ncurrent.next=1\nprev is 2\ncurrent is 3.\n\nIteration 3:\nnext_node=None\ncurrent.next=2\nprev=3\ncurrent becomes None. Loop ends.\n\nReturn prev=3.\n\nWhich is correct: 3->2->1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother test case: single node. head is 5. Then prev starts as None, current is 5. First iteration: next is None. current.next is None (since prev is None, but that doesn't change anything). prev becomes 5. Loop ends. Return 5. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: empty list. head is None. Return None. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTherefore, the function is as written above.\n</think>\n\nTo reverse a singly linked list in place, we can use a three-pointer approach. This method iterates through the list, adjusting the pointers of each node to point to the previous node, thus reversing the list efficiently in a single pass.\n\n**Solution code:**\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** We start with three pointers: `prev` set to `None`, `current` set to the head of the list.\n2. **Iteration:** We traverse each node in the list using a `while` loop:\n   - **Store next node:** Before modifying the current node's next pointer, we store the next node in `next_node`.\n   - **Overlap current's next:** Set the current node's next pointer to `prev`, effectively reversing the direction of the link.\n   - **Advance pointers:** Move `prev` and `current` one step forward.\n3. **Completion:** Once the loop ends (when `current` becomes `None`), `prev` points to the new head of the reversed list.\n4. **Return:** The function returns `prev`, which is the new head of the reversed linked list.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently reverse the linked list in place with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.",
