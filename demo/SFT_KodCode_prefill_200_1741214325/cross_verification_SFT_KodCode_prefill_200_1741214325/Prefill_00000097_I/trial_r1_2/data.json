  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to remove duplicates from a list while keeping the original order. Hmm, how do I approach this? Let's think.\n\nSo, the main goal is to go through each element in the list and only include it if it hasn't been seen before, right? That means I need a way to track which elements I've already encountered.\n\nOh, right! I can use a dictionary to keep track of the elements I've seen so far. Wait, but wait, in Python versions before 3.7, dictionaries didn't maintain insertion order. But since I'm probably using a newer version, I can rely on the dictionary to preserve the order.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a list to keep track, but checking if an element is in a list is O(n), which might be slower for large lists. Using a set would be faster for lookups, O(1), since sets are designed for quick membership testing. So maybe I should use a set to track seen elements.\n\nWait, here's an idea: I'll create an empty set called seen. Then, I'll create an empty list called result. I'll iterate over each element in the input list. For each element, if it's not in seen, I'll add it to result and then add it to seen. That way, only the first occurrence is kept, and duplicates are skipped.\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose the list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]. The function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]. When I iterate, 1 is not in seen, so it's added. 2 is not in seen, added. 3 is added. Then 2 is already in seen, so it's skipped. Same with 1. 4 is new, so added.\n\nThat makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set called seen.\n2. Initialize an empty list called result.\n3. Iterate over each element in the input list.\n4. For each element, check if it's in seen.\n   a. If not, append it to result and add it to seen.\n   b. If yes, skip it.\n5. After processing all elements, return the result list.\n\nDoes this handle all cases? What about unhashable types, like lists or dictionaries? Well, if the elements are not hashable, adding them to the set will cause an error. But the problem statement just says a list, so I guess we can assume the elements are hashable, like integers, strings, etc.\n\nWhat about order preservation? Since we process each element in order and only add each element once, the first occurrence's position is preserved, so the order remains as it was.\n\nSo, to implement this, the function can be written as:\n\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for element in lst:\n        if element not in seen:\n            result.append(element)\n            seen.add(element)\n    return result\n\nLet me test this function with a few cases.\n\nTest case 1: lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]\nExpected output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nFunction should return this correctly.\n\nTest case 2: lst = [\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\", \"c\", \"a\"]\nExpected output: [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n\nTest case 3: Empty list: []\nFunction should return empty.\n\nTest case 4: One element: [5]\nReturns [5].\n\nTest case 5: All elements the same: [3,3,3,3]\nReturns [3].\n\nSeems solid. I think this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that removes duplicate elements from a list while preserving the original order of elements. The goal is to ensure that each element appears only once in the resulting list, maintaining the order of their first occurrence.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a set to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. This allows for O(1) average time complexity for membership checks, making the function efficient even for larger lists. Additionally, an empty list is used to store the result, preserving the order of elements as they first appear.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: For each element in the input list, check if it has already been encountered by looking it up in the set.\n\n3. **Update Structures**: If the element has not been encountered before, add it to both the result list and the set. If it has been encountered, simply skip it.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list, and uses O(n) space to store the result and the set of encountered elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    seen = set()\n    result = []\n    for element in lst:\n        if element not in seen:\n            result.append(element)\n            seen.add(element)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty set `seen` and an empty list `result`.\n- **Iteration**: It then iterates over each element in the input list `lst`.\n- **Membership Check**: For each element, it checks if the element is already in the `seen` set.\n  - **If Not Seen**: If the element is not in `seen`, it is added to both `result` and `seen`.\n  - **If Seen**: If the element is already in `seen`, it is skipped to avoid adding duplicates.\n- **Return Result**: After processing all elements, the function returns the `result` list which contains the elements in their original order without duplicates.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the removal of duplicates while preserving the order and ensures optimal performance for typical use cases.",
