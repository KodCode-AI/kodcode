  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called find_primes_in_range that finds all the prime numbers between a given start and end, inclusive. The function should return a list of these primes.\n\nHmm, let me think about what a prime number is. A prime is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, for each number in the given range, I need to check if it's a prime.\n\nWait, but checking each number by testing divisibility up to its square root isn't efficient for large ranges, but for this problem, maybe it's acceptable unless the test cases are with really big numbers.\n\nSo first, the function takes two arguments, start and end. Then, it needs to loop through each number from start to end, inclusive.\n\nFor each number n in this range:\n\n1. If n is less than 2, it's not prime. So we can immediately skip these.\n2. For n >=2, check if any number from 2 up to sqrt(n) divides n. If any do, it's not prime. Otherwise, add it to the list.\n\nWait, but what about numbers where start is 1? Like the test case where start is 1 and end is 5, you get [2,3,5]. So n has to be at least 2.\n\nSo, in code, for each n in range(start, end+1):\n\nIf n < 2, skip.\n\nElse, check if n is prime. So let's create a helper function is_prime that takes a number and returns True if it's prime.\n\nWait, no need for a helper function maybe. Maybe do it inline.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize an empty list of primes.\n- Loop n through the range from start to end, including both.\n- For each n, if it's less than 2, skip.\n- For other n, check for divisibility up to sqrt(n). For that, iterate from 2 to sqrt(n) +1. If any divisor divides n, break and mark as not prime. Else, add to primes.\n- Return the primes list.\n\nOkay, but let me think about the efficiency. What if start is 1 and end is like 1e6? Then, checking each number individually might be slow. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample test cases, maybe the inputs are manageable. Since the test cases include ranges up to 60, for example, efficiency isn't a problem.\n\nSo, let me plan the structure.\n\nFirst, create an empty list primes.\n\nLoop n from start to end, inclusive.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <=1: continue.\n\nElse:\n\nCreate a flag is_prime = True.\n\nCheck for divisors from 2 to sqrt(n). So for i in range 2 to int(sqrt(n)) +1.\n\nWait, because sqrt(n) might not be an integer, so we can take the integer part and add 1 to include the square root if it is integer.\n\nSo for i in 2 to int(n**0.5) +1:\n\nif n % i ==0, then it's not prime, set is_prime=False, break the loop.\n\nIf after checking all i's, is_prime is still True, then add n to primes.\n\nElse, skip.\n\nAfter processing all n, return primes.\n\nI think that's the plan.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWait, but let's think about some edge cases. For example, if start is 0 or 1. Like the fifth sample, which is start=1 and end=5, and returns [2,3,5].\n\nSo our code should handle n=2 and n=3, etc.\n\nWhat about in the case where start equals end, like the sample where start and end are 14. Then, n is 14, which is non-prime. So the list is empty.\n\nAnother thing, for n=2, the only even prime, the loop for divisors will not enter because sqrt(2) is ~1.414, int(1.414) is 1, so the range is 2 to 2, which actually runs from 2 to 2, so no loops. Thus, 2 is considered prime and added.\n\nWait, let's see: when n is 2, sqrt(2) is approx 1.414. int(sqrt(2)) is 1. So the range is from 2 to 2 (inclusive? Or exclusive? Because in the loop it's range(2, int(sqrt(n)) +1). Wait, if n=2, int(sqrt(2)) is 1, so +1 gives 2. Then, for i in range(2, 2) is an empty range. So the for loop doesn't run. Thus, is_prime remains True, and 2 is added.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for n=3: sqrt(3) is about 1.732. int is 1, so range becomes 2 to 2, no loop runs, 3 is added.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTesting n=4: sqrt(4) is 2, so range is 2 to 3. i starts at 2, 4%2=0, so not prime.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is more efficient for a range of numbers. However, for small ranges, the difference is negligible. But for a function that's supposed to handle potentially big ranges, the sieve might be better.\n\nHmm, considering that. Sieve is O(n log log n), while checking each number using trial division is O(n*sqrt(n)), which is much worse for large n.\n\nBut if the function is supposed to find primes in a range, sieve could be either implemented within that range or the sieve could be generated up to end and then filter the primes.\n\nBut let's think: when end can be up to, say, 1e6, sieve is better. But for the current problem, perhaps the trial division is easier to implement, even if it's less efficient.\n\nBut since the function is supposed to return primes within a given range, perhaps it's better to implement an optimized approach.\n\nWait, but which is better in code length and simplicity. For the requirements of this problem, let's consider the test cases are small.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the function will be tested on very large ranges. So for bigger ranges, the current approach would be too slow. So maybe using the sieve is better.\n\nBut implementing sieve can be a bit tricky. Let me think how.\n\nWell, if the range is from start to end, and end can be large, but sieve needs to compute primes up to end.\n\nWait, no, because the sieve of Eratosthenes needs to create a boolean array up to end. So for very large end, this can be memory-intensive.\n\nAlternatively, in the trial division approach, for each n in the range, check if it's prime. Each check is O(sqrt(n)).\n\nBut for n up to 1e12, this would be impossible. But in the problem's constraints, as given by the samples, it's manageable.\n\nBut since the problem provides test cases where the function returns primes up to 60, perhaps the intended solution is trial division.\n\nSo, let me proceed with the trial division method.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nFirst, generate all numbers from start to end. For each, check if it's a prime; if yes, add to the list.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nimport math\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_primes_in_range(start: int, end: int) -> List[int]:\n    primes = []\n    for n in range(start, end +1):\n        if n < 2:\n            continue\n        is_prime = True\n        sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n        for i in range(2, sqrt_n +1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(n)\n    return primes\n\nWait, but wait: in Python, math.sqrt returns a float, so math.isqrt is better since it returns an integer and is available in Python 3.8 and above.\n\nBut the problem is, for n in the range, when n is a perfect square, like 25, i would go up to 5, which is correct.\n\nWait, also, in the loop for i in 2 to sqrt(n) +1.\n\nWait, earlier plan was to loop from 2 to sqrt_n +1, but with math.isqrt, sqrt_n is already the integer part.\n\nSo for math.isqrt(n), let\u2019s say n=25, sqrt is 5. So loop would be 2 to 5+1, which is 6, but the actual loop is 2 to 5 inclusive. Because in Python, the end is exclusive.\n\nWait, yes, in code, for i in range(2, sqrt_n +1): because when sqrt_n is 5, range(2, 5+1) is 2,3,4,5. Because 5+1 is 6, which is the end of the range (exclusive). So yes, the loop will run for all i up to 5, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should correctly identify primes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: find_primes_in_range(5,10) --> [5,7]\n\nIn the code:\n\nn=5: 5 >=2. sqrt is 2, since isqrt(5) is 2. So i loops 2,3? Wait, range(2, 2+1) is 2,3? No, range(2,3) in Python is [2]. Because 2 is the start, stop is 3. So i runs 2 only. 5%2 is 1, so 5 is prime. So added.\n\nn=6: isqrt is 2 (2^2=4 <6, next is 3^2=9>6). So i is 2. 6%2 ==0, not prime.\n\nn=7: isqrt is 2. So check 2. 7%2 is 1. So 7 is added.\n\nn=8: i=2, 8%2==0 \u2192 no.\n\nn=9: i runs 2 to 3. 9%3=0 \u2192 no.\n\nn=10: i runs 2 to 3. 10%2=0 \u2192 no.\n\nThus, primes are [5,7]. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 10-15 \u2192 [11,13]\n\nn=10: 2-3,10%2=0 \u2192 no.\n\nn=11: isqrt(11)=3. So i ranges 2-4? Wait wait, 3+1 is 4. So range(2,4) \u2192 i=2,3.\n\n11%2=1, 11%3=2 \u2192 added.\n\nn=12: divisible by 2 \u2192 no.\n\nn=13: isqrt is 3. i 2-4: 2,3,4? Wait, 3+1 is 4. range(2,4) would be 2,3.\n\n13%2=1, 13%3=1 \u2192 added.\n\nn=14: 14%2=0 \u2192 no.\n\nn=15: divisible by 3 \u2192 no.\n\nSo [11,13]. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: 20-25. 20 and 21,22,23,24,25. 23 is prime (since factors up to sqrt(23)=4). So yes, 23 is added. 25 is 5^5. So i runs 2-6? Wait, sqrt is 5, +1, end is 6. i=2, 25%5=0. So not added.\n\nThus, output is [23].\n\nAnother sample: start=14, end=14 \u2192 14, which is not prime \u2192 list is empty.\n\nSample: start=50, end=60. 50 is even. 51 is divisible by 3. 52 even. 53 is prime: sqrt is 7. So check 2-7. 53 mod 2,3,5,7? 53%2=1, and not divisible by any \u2192 added. 54: even. 55: 5*11. 56 even. 57: 3*19. 58 even. 59 is next: sqrt is 7. So primes are 53,59.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, testing the case where the start is 1: 1-5 gives [2,3,5].\n\nWhich code correctly does.\n\nWait, let's make sure. For n=1, the code skips because n<2. So no issue.\n\nAnother test case: n=2 is correctly added.\n\nWait, but let's see: when start is 2 and end is 2, function returns [2]. Correct.\n\nHow about when start is 0: 0-5? The function should return [2,3,5]. Correct.\n\nSo now, edge cases.\n\nAnother edge case: start > end. But according to the problem statement, the function should assume that start is <= end. Or else, the function might have to handle that case.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says to write a function that takes a given range, so I'm assuming that start is less than or equal to end. But perhaps, for invalid cases where start>end, the function returns empty list. Or otherwise, handles it.\n\nLooking again at the problem statement: looking at the sample inputs, in the sample where 14 is passed as both, the function returns an empty list. So probably, no issues.\n\nBut in code, it's better to handle cases where start > end. So, perhaps we should add:\n\nif start > end:\n    return []\n\nSo, perhaps the function should handle that.\n\nBut the test cases given do not include such a scenario, so perhaps it's better to add that condition.\n\nSo, in the code, first we check if start > end: return empty list.\n\nYes, that would be a good addition.\n\nSo, the code would be modified to:\n\nprimes = []\n\nif start > end:\n    return primes\n\nelse:\n    loop n from start to end.\n\nThus, better to include that.\n\nSo, adding:\n\nprimes = []\nif start > end:\n    return primes\n\nWait, but in Python, range doesn't allow reverse steps if step is not given as negative. So if start>end, the range would return empty, thus the for loop doesn't execute.\n\nWait, so in the code, without checking, if start is 10 and end is 5, the range is 10 to 5, which in Python, the default step is 1, but 5 is less than 10, so the range is empty. So the loop doesn't run, the primes remain empty.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo no need to add this condition because if start>end, the for loop won't execute, and the function correctly returns the empty list.\n\nThus, the code may not need that condition.\n\nTesting: if function call is find_primes_in_range(10,5), the for loop doesn't run. So returns empty list.\n\nThus, correct behavior without the condition.\n\nThus, the code remains as above.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nImport math.\n\nWait, do I need to import anything else? Well, the function uses math.isqrt.\n\nWait, in Python, for versions before 3.8, math.isqrt isn't available. But assuming that the problem uses Python 3.8 or above.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that finds all prime numbers within a given range (inclusive). A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves checking each number in the given range to determine if it is a prime number. For each number, we will:\n1. Skip numbers less than 2 as they are not prime.\n2. For numbers greater than or equal to 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number in this range divides the number without a remainder, it is not a prime. Otherwise, it is a prime.\n\nThis approach is efficient for small ranges and leverages trial division up to the square root of the number to check for primality, which optimizes the number of checks needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_primes_in_range(start: int, end: int) -> List[int]:\n    primes = []\n    for n in range(start, end + 1):\n        if n < 2:\n            continue\n        is_prime = True\n        sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n        for i in range(2, sqrt_n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(n)\n    return primes\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers found.\n2. **Iterate through the Range**: Loop through each number `n` from `start` to `end` (inclusive).\n3. **Check for Non-Prime Numbers**: If `n` is less than 2, skip it since it is not a prime.\n4. **Primality Check**: For each number `n`, assume it is a prime (`is_prime = True`). Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, set `is_prime` to `False` and break the loop.\n5. **Collect Primes**: If `n` is determined to be a prime, add it to the `primes` list.\n6. **Return Result**: After processing all numbers in the range, return the list of primes.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each number and ensures that we correctly identify all prime numbers within the specified range.",
