  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called is_palindrome_number which takes an integer and returns a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome. Hmm, a palindrome number reads the same backward as forward. So 121 is a palindrome because reversing it gives 121 again. But wait, what about negative numbers? Oh right, negative numbers can't be palindromes because the minus sign is at the beginning, and when reversed, it would be at the end. So any negative number should return False.\n\nFirst, handle the case where the number is negative. I'll check if the number is less than zero and immediately return False if that's the case.\n\nIf the number is zero, that's a palindrome, so return True.\n\nThen, I think I need to reverse the number and compare it with the original. How to reverse an integer? Well, I can convert the number to a string and then reverse it, then compare both string representations. Oh wait, but if the number is 10, converting to string would give me '10' reversed as '01', which is '10' != '01', so that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way is to reverse the number mathematically without converting to a string. Maybe I should do that to avoid string operations, but since the numbers can be large, maybe it's better to stick with strings since it's easier.\n\nWait, the problem constraints say nothing about the size, but in Python, converting to strings isn't a problem even for big numbers. So, I can proceed that way.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. If the number is negative, return False.\n\n2. Else, convert the number to a string, reverse it, and check if the original string equals the reversed string.\n\nBut wait a second, let's see. Let's test with the examples given:\n\nExample 1: 121 \u2014 reversed is 121, so True.\nExample 2: 1331 \u2014 reversed is 1331, True.\nExample 3: 12321 \u2014 reversed is same, True.\n0 returns True, as per the test case.\n\nHow about 7? It's single digit, so True.\n\nWhat about 10? The string is '10', reversed is '01' \u2014 which is not the same, so returns False. That makes sense because 10 is not a palindrome.\n\nSo implementing this:\n\nFunction:\n\nTake the number. If it's negative, return False.\n\nElse, convert to a string. Reverse the string. Compare.\n\nIf they're equal, return True, else False.\n\nWait, but string reversal can be done with slicing in Python: [::-1].\n\nYes, so for example, str_num = str(number), reversed_num = str_num[::-1], then compare if str_num == reversed_num.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nWait, what about the number zero? Number is 0, which is a palindrome.\n\nDon't forget the case when the number is 0. But in the above logic, 0 is not negative, so it will be converted to string '0', reversed is '0', so condition holds.\n\nTest case for 0: returns True.\n\nAnother test case: number like 1. Wait, according to the examples, 0, 1, 9, etc., are single-digit and return True, which is correct.\n\nSo, implementing:\n\ndef is_palindrome_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    if number < 0:\n        return False\n    s = str(number)\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\nWait, but wait. What about numbers with leading zeros in the reversed string? Wait, the function treats the number as a string, so leading zeros won't be considered because integers don't have leading zeros. For example, 120 becomes '120' reversed as '021', but as a number? But in this code, it's treated as a string, so s is '120' and reversed is '021'; since they're different, it's correct.\n\nBut can that be a problem? Let's say the number is 10. The strings '10' and '01' are different, which is correct because 10 is not a palindrome.\n\nAnother test case: -121 returns False, which is correct.\n\nWhat about number 2? '2' reversed is '2', so returns True.\n\nOK, I think this function covers all the cases in the examples and more.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. This approach involves converting the number into a string to easily reverse and compare it.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Negative Numbers**: Negative numbers cannot be palindromes because the negative sign would be at the end when reversed, which is not the same as the original number. Hence, if the number is negative, we immediately return `False`.\n\n2. **Convert Number to String**: Convert the integer to its string representation. This allows us to easily reverse the digits of the number.\n\n3. **Reverse the String**: Use string slicing to reverse the string. In Python, this can be done with `[::-1]`.\n\n4. **Compare Strings**: Check if the original string is equal to its reversed version. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    if number < 0:\n        return False\n    s = str(number)\n    return s == s[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Negative Check**: The function first checks if the number is negative. If it is, the function returns `False` immediately.\n- **String Conversion**: The number is converted to a string to leverage string manipulation capabilities.\n- **Reversing the String**: The string is reversed using slicing (`[::-1]`), which creates a new string with characters in reverse order.\n- **String Comparison**: The original string and the reversed string are compared. If they are identical, the number is a palindrome.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including single-digit numbers, zero, and negative numbers, ensuring accurate results for all valid integer inputs.",
