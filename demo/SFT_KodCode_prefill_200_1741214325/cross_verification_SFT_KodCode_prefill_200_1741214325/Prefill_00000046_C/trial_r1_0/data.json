  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called is_palindrome_number that takes an integer and returns a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome. Hmm, what's a palindrome? Oh right, it's a number that reads the same backward as forward. Like 121 or 1331.\n\nWait, but negative numbers? Oh, looking at the examples, is_palindrome_number(-121) returns False. So negative numbers can't be palindromes because the minus sign would make the first character different from the last. Got it.\n\nSo the steps I think are: first, check if the number is negative. If it is, return False immediately.\n\nBut what about zero? Oh, looking at the example, is_palindrome_number(0) is True. So zero is a valid case.\n\nNow, the main part: how to check if the number is the same reversed.\n\nI remember one way is to reverse the digits of the number and compare it to the original.\n\nSo let me think about how to reverse a number. Like, take 121: we can get each digit starting from the end and build the reversed number.\n\nBut wait, what about numbers that end with zero? Like 120. The reversed would be 021, but leading zeros aren't allowed in integers, so that's easy since 021 is 21, but 120 reversed is 21, which is different so it won't be a palindrome anyway.\n\nSo, proceed:\n\n1. Handle the case where the number is negative. Return False.\n\nHow? Well, if the number is less than zero, then it's negative. So something like:\n\nif number < 0:\n    return False\n\n2. Convert the number into a string and compare it with its reverse. Or maybe work purely with integers.\n\nHmm, in code, sometimes it's easier to handle strings, but maybe I should do it without converting to a string. Let me think about how to reverse the number.\n\nSo for non-negative numbers:\n\noriginal_num = number\nreversed_num = 0\n\nwhile the number is greater than zero:\n    remainder = number % 10 \u21d2 gives the last digit\n    reversed_num = (reversed_num * 10) + remainder\n    number = number // 10\n\nWait, wait, wait. But wait: in each iteration, number is getting smaller, right? So loop until number becomes zero.\n\nWait, no, the loop condition is number > 0. So, yes.\n\nWait, but what about numbers that have leading zeros when reversed? Oh, but in integer form, leading zeros are discarded. But since the original number doesn't have leading zeros, except for 0 itself, which is a palindrome, so we're safe.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nnumber=121:\nreversed_num starts at 0.\n\nLoop 1: number=121 \u2192 rem=1 \u2192 reversed=0*10+1=1. number=12.\nLoop 2: rem=2 \u2192 reversed=1*10+2=12. number=1.\nLoop3: rem=1 \u2192 reversed=12*10+1=121. number=0 \u2192 loop ends.\n\nSo 121 is same as reversed, so True.\n\nAnother example: 12321.\n\nLet's see reversed steps:\n\n12321 / 10 \u2192 rem=1 \u2192 reversed 1, number 1232\nNext, rem=2 \u2192 reversed 12. number 123.\nNext rem=3 \u2192 reversed=123 \u2192 number 12\nrem=2 \u2192 rev 123*10+2=1232. number 1.\nrem=1 \u2192 rev 12321. So correct.\n\nBut what about numbers that end with zero? Like 1001:\n\nBut let's see. Number=1001.\n\nLoop:\nrem=1 \u2192 rev=1, number=100.\nrem=0 \u2192 rev=10 (since 1*10 +0=10). number=10.\nrem=0 \u2192 rev=100 (10*10+0=100). number=1.\nrem=1 \u2192 rev=1001. So 1001 is same as reversed, it is a palindrome, so it would return True.\n\nSo yeah, the approach works.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n- If number is negative: return False.\n- Else, split the number into two parts: original and reversed. Then compare.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to handle the edge case first. Also, what about numbers like 1, 0, etc.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\ndef is_palindrome_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    if number < 0:\n        return False\n    original = number\n    reversed_num = 0\n    while number > 0:\n        remainder = number % 10\n        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + remainder\n        number = number //10\n    return original == reversed_num\n\nWait, but what about cases where the original is zero? Well, in the loop, number would start as zero, which is not greater than zero, so the loop doesn't run. reversed_num remains zero, and returns original (0) equals reversed_num (0) \u2192 True, correct.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nTest1: is_palindrome_number(121) should return True. Let's see, the process:\n\noriginal is 121, reversed becomes 121, so True.\n\nTest2: is_palindrome_number(1331) \u2192 True?\n\nWait, let's compute.\n\n1331.\n\nLoop:\n\nnumber starts as 1331 >0:\n\nrem=1 \u2192 reversed=0*10+1=1 \u2192 number 133.\n\nnext: rem=3 \u2192 rev=1*10+3=13 \u2192 number 13.\n\nrem=3 \u2192 rev=13*10+3=133 \u2192 number 1.\n\nrem=1 \u2192 rev=133*10+1=1331. So compare original 1331 == 1331 \u2192 True.\n\nAnother test case: 9 returns True. Correct.\n\nWhat about 123? Let's see.\n\noriginal is 123.\n\nloop:\n\nnumber=123.\n\nrem=3 \u2192 rev=3 \u2192 number 12.\n\nrem=2 \u2192 rev=32 \u2192 number 1.\n\nrem=1 \u2192 rev=321. Compare to original 123. Not equal. Return False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 56789 \u2192 reversed is 98765. So not same. Return False.\n\nWhat about -121 \u2192 function returns False, correct.\n\nWhat about 1001?\n\nFunction:\n\n1001>0 \u2192 loop starts.\n\nrem=1 \u2192 rev=1, number 100.\n\nrem=0 \u2192 rev=0 + 1*10=10? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, number starts as 1001.\n\nfirst step:\n\nnumber is 1001 \u2192 rem=1. reversed becomes 1. number becomes 100.\n\nnext iteration:\n\nnumber=100.\n\nrem=0. reversed is 10 \u2192 because 1*10+0=10. number becomes 10.\n\nnext iteration:\n\nrem=0 \u2192 reversed is 100 (10*10+0). number becomes 1.\n\nnext iteration:\n\nrem=1 \u2192 reversed is 100 *10 +1=1001. number becomes 0.\n\nNow compare original (1001) with reversed (1001) \u2192 return True.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nWait another point: What about when the original number is zero? The function returns True, which is correct.\n\nWhat about two-digit palindromes, like 11? Correct.\n\nEjemplo: number=11.\n\nReversed:\n\nnumber=11.\n\nloop starts:\n\nrem 1 \u2192 rev=1. number becomes 1.\n\nrem 1 \u2192 rev=11. number becomes 0. return 11 ==11 \u2192 True.\n\nWait, but something's wrong. Let me compute 11 in code:\n\noriginal=11, reversed starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration: number=11, remainder=1. reversed=1. number=1.\n\nSecond iteration: number>0? yes, 1>0. remainder=1. reversed=1*10 +1=11. number=0.\n\nSo yes, 11 is considered a palindrome.\n\nSo it works.\n\nAnother test: number=10 \u2192 reversed is 1 (since 10)\n\nWait, original is 10.\n\nLoop:\n\nnumber=10:\n\nrem=0. reversed=0+0=0 \u2192 number becomes 1.\n\nnext: number>0? yes.\n\nrem=1 \u2192 reversed=0*10 +1=1. number becomes 0.\n\nSo reversed is 1. compare 10 ==1 \u2192 False.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo I think this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for Negative Numbers**: Negative numbers cannot be palindromes because the negative sign would make the first character different from the last. Thus, if the input number is negative, we immediately return `False`.\n\n2. **Reverse the Number**: For non-negative numbers, we reverse the digits of the number. This is done by repeatedly extracting the last digit of the number and building the reversed number.\n\n3. **Compare Original and Reversed Numbers**: After reversing the digits, we compare the original number with the reversed number. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    if number < 0:\n        return False\n    original = number\n    reversed_num = 0\n    while number > 0:\n        remainder = number % 10\n        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + remainder\n        number = number // 10\n    return original == reversed_num\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Negative Check**: The function first checks if the input number is negative. If it is, the function returns `False` immediately.\n\n2. **Reversing the Number**: The function then initializes the reversed number to 0 and repeatedly extracts the last digit of the input number using modulo 10. This digit is then appended to the reversed number by shifting the digits of the reversed number left (multiplying by 10) and adding the extracted digit. The input number is then reduced by removing the last digit (integer division by 10). This process continues until all digits are processed.\n\n3. **Comparison**: Finally, the reversed number is compared with the original number. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for palindromes without converting the number to a string, ensuring optimal performance and handling all edge cases correctly.",
