  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a recursive function called factorial that takes an integer n and returns its factorial. But wait, the original function is iterative, right? So the user provided an iterative version, and now I have to make a recursive one.\n\nFirst, let me remember what a factorial is. For a positive integer n, n! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. So for example, 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Oh and 0! is 1, that's a special case. Also, if n is negative, the function should return None because factorial isn't defined for negatives.\n\nSo the function signature is the same: def factorial(n: int) -> int | None:.\n\nHmm, how to convert the iterative version to recursion. Let's think about the base cases first. For n=0 or n=1, the factorial is 1. So if n is 0 or 1, we return 1. But wait, the original function returns 1 for n=0 and returns factorial correctly. So for recursive case, when n is greater than 1, we can call factorial(n-1) and multiply by n.\n\nBut wait, what about negative n? Oh right, the function should check if n is negative and return None immediately.\n\nSo the structure would be something like:\n\nif n < 0:\n    return None\nelif n == 0 or n ==1:\n    return 1\nelse:\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nThat makes sense. So for n=2, it would return 2*factorial(1) which is 2*1=2, correct. For n=3, 3*factorial(2)=3*2=6, and so on.\n\nWait, but in recursion, we have to ensure that we don't get into an infinite loop. What if someone calls factorial(0)? Oh, because in the base case, if n is 0 or 1, we return 1. So that's covered.\n\nTesting with n=5: factorial(5) =5 * factorial(4) which is 5*4*factorial(3), and so on until factorial(1) returns 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the original function and how it's handled. The recursive function should mirror that logic but in a recursive way.\n\nAnother thing to consider: what if n is not an integer? Like, say n is a float, but in the function, n is typed as int, so that's handled.\n\nBut the function returns int | None, so when n is negative, returns None, else returns integer.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function is:\n\nCheck if n is less than 0, return None.\n\nElse if n is 0 or 1, return 1.\n\nElse, return n multiplied by factorial(n-1).\n\nThat should cover all cases.\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1: n = 0\nFunction returns 1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: n = 1\nFunction returns 1. Correct.\n\nExample 3: n = 5\nFunction returns 5*4*3*2*1 =120. Correct.\n\nExample 4: n = -3\nFunction returns None. Correct.\n\nEdge case: n = 1 (already covered), n=2, which returns 2. Correct.\n\nWhat about a larger number, say 10? It should return 3628800. Correct.\n\nI think this should work. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given integer \\( n \\). The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The factorial of a number \\( n \\) (denoted as \\( n! \\)) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\( n \\). By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1, and factorial is not defined for negative integers.\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: We can solve this problem using recursion. Recursion is a method where the function calls itself with a modified argument until it reaches a base case.\n3. **Base Cases**:\n   - If \\( n \\) is negative, return `None` because factorial is not defined for negative integers.\n   - If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, return 1 as these are the base cases for factorial.\n4. **Recursive Case**: For \\( n \\) greater than 1, the function will call itself with \\( n-1 \\) and multiply the result by \\( n \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we break down the problem into smaller subproblems until we reach the base cases, and then combine the results to get the final answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the factorial of n using recursion. If n is a negative integer, \n    the function returns None. For n=0 or n=1, the function returns 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return None\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The function first checks if \\( n \\) is negative, returning `None` if true. If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, it returns 1 as these are the starting points for calculating factorials.\n- **Recursive Case**: For \\( n \\) greater than 1, the function calls itself with \\( n-1 \\) and multiplies the result by \\( n \\). This recursive call continues until it reaches the base case.\n\nThis recursive method efficiently breaks down the problem into smaller parts, leveraging function calls to simplify the calculation until reaching the simplest form. The final result is then built up step-by-step as the recursion unwinds.",
