  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to find the nth Fibonacci number. Hmm, where do I start? I remember the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and so on.\n\nWait, sometimes people start counting from 0 and sometimes from 1. I should clarify that. Oh right, in the problem statement, does n start at 0 or 1? The Fibonacci sequence is often defined with F(0)=0, F(1)=1. So I think I'll go with that.\n\nSo the function needs to take an integer n as input and return the nth Fibonacci number. Let's think about the base cases first. If n is 0, return 0. If n is 1, return 1. That makes sense.\n\nFor other values of n, the Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding ones. So I could use recursion, but wait, recursion might not be efficient for large n because it recalculates the same values many times. I think for larger n, an iterative approach would be better.\n\nLet me outline the iterative method. I can initialize two variables, a and b, where a is F(n-2) and b is F(n-1). Starting from 2, I can loop up to n, updating a and b each time.\n\nLet me sketch this:\n\nif n == 0:\n    return 0\nelif n == 1:\n    return 1\nelse:\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        c = a + b\n        a = b\n        b = c\n    return b\n\nWait, let me test this logic. For n=2, the loop runs from 2 to 2, so once. c = 0 +1 =1, then a becomes 1, b becomes 1. Return b which is 1. Yeah, that's correct because F(2)=1.\n\nFor n=3, loop runs from 2 to 3. First iteration (i=2): c=1, a=1, b=1. Second iteration (i=3): c=1+1=2, a=1, b=2. Return 2, which is F(3)=2. That works.\n\nWhat about n=5? The sequence up to F(5) is 0,1,1,2,3,5. So F(5)=5. Let me see: The loop runs from 2 to 5, which is 4 iterations. Starting with a=0, b=1.\n\ni=2: c=1, a=1, b=1\ni=3: c=2, a=1, b=2\ni=4: c=3, a=2, b=3\ni=5: c=5, a=3, b=5\nReturn 5, correct.\n\nGreat, so the iterative method seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a recursive helper function, but it's less efficient. Maybe for the sake of thoroughness, but I think iterative is better here because it's O(n) time and O(1) space, which is efficient.\n\nAnother approach could be using Binet's formula, which is a closed-form solution. But that might involve floating-point operations and could be less accurate for large n due to precision issues. So iterative is probably the best approach.\n\nLet me code this function now.\n\nWait, what if n is zero? The function correctly returns 0. And if n is one, it returns 1. So the base cases are covered.\n\nI think this should handle all cases. Let me think about possible test cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=0 \u2192 returns 0, correct.\nTest case 2: n=1 \u2192 1, correct.\nTest case3: n=2 \u21921.\nTest case4: n=5\u21925.\nTest case5: n=10\u219255.\n\nLet me compute n=10 manually. The sequence up to 10 is: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55. So yes, F(10)=55.\n\nAnother edge case: what if n is negative? Oh, but the problem says nth Fibonacci number, and probably n is non-negative. So I'll assume n is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut perhaps I should add a check to handle cases where n is less than 0, maybe raise a ValueError. Otherwise, trying to loop from 2 to n when n is less than 2 could cause issues.\n\nSo adding a condition: if n <0, raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\") or something like that.\n\nSo updating the function:\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n ==0:\n        return 0\n    elif n ==1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n+1):\n            c = a + b\n            a = b\n            b = c\n        return b\n\nThat should handle negative n gracefully.\n\nI think that's a solid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo find the nth Fibonacci number, we can use an iterative approach that efficiently calculates the result with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Problem Analysis:**\n   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.\n   - We need to determine the nth Fibonacci number, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\n2. **Base Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0, return 0.\n   - If `n` is 1, return 1.\n\n3. **Iterative Approach:**\n   - For values of `n` greater than 1, use two variables to keep track of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.\n   - Iterate from 2 to `n`, updating these variables to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers at each step.\n   - After completing the loop, the variable holding the latest Fibonacci number is returned.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Handle cases where `n` is negative by raising an appropriate error.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            c = a + b\n            a = b\n            b = c\n        return b\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- `fibonacci(0)` returns `0`.\n- `fibonacci(1)` returns `1`.\n- `fibonacci(2)` returns `1`.\n- `fibonacci(5)` returns `5`.\n- `fibonacci(10)` returns `55`.",
