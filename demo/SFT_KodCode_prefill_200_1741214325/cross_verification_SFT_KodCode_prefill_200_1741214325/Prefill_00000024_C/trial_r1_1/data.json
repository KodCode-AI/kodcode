  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to calculate the number of unique paths in an M x N grid where I can only move right or down. Hmm, I remember this is a classic problem. Let me think about how to approach it.\n\nSo, let's take a small example first. Suppose M is 2 and N is 2. The grid is like 2 rows and 2 columns. So, you can imagine a grid with points (0,0) at top-left and (1,1) at bottom-right. The number of unique paths there should be 2: right then down, or down then right. That matches the sample, so that works.\n\nFor a 3x3 grid, the number of paths is 6. So, how did that happen? I think for an MxN grid, the number of steps you need to take is (M-1) downs and (N-1) rights, right? Because in a 3x3 grid, you go from (0,0) to (2,2), which requires 2 downs and 2 rights in some order.\n\nSo, the total number of steps is (M-1 + N-1) steps. And we need to choose how to arrange these steps. Each path is a permutation of these moves, but since there are duplicates (since the rights and downs are indistinct beyond their directions), we need to compute the binomial coefficient.\n\nWait, binomial coefficient makes sense here. So the formula should be (M-1 + N-1) choose (M-1), which is the same as (M+N-2) choose (M-1) or (N-1).\n\nLet me think about how to compute this. Because for large M and N, calculating factorials directly might cause overflow or take a lot of computation. But for the problem's purposes, maybe the inputs are manageable.\n\nSo, the number of unique paths is C(m+n-2, m-1) where C is the combination function. Alternatively, it's the same as C(m+n-2, n-1). Since combination is symmetric.\n\nSo the task is to compute this binomial coefficient efficiently. How do I implement this in Python?\n\nOne way is to compute it using the formula for combinations. The formula is (a choose b) = a!/(b! (a-b)! ). But for large a and b, computing factorials can be computationally expensive. So perhaps a multiplicative approach would be better, calculating C(a, b) as the product from a down to (a - b + 1) divided by the product from 1 to b. This reduces the risk of large intermediate values and is more efficient.\n\nFor example, calculating C(4,2) = 6. 4*3/(2*1) = 6.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Take m and n as inputs.\n2. Compute the total steps: total = m + n - 2.\n3. Compute k, which is the smaller of (m-1) and (n-1). Because it's more efficient to compute the smaller of the two to reduce the number of multiplications.\n4. Calculate the combination as total!/(k! * (total -k)! ), using the multiplicative approach to avoid large intermediate factorials.\n\nWait, but if m is 1 or n is 1, like the samples, the result is 1 because you can only move in one direction. So our approach needs to handle that as well.\n\nLet me see: if m is 1, then you have to move all rights, so that's only one path. Similarly for n=1, only down moves. So our formula should cover that case since when m=1, the combination will be (something choose 0) which is 1. Same for n=1.\n\nSo, the plan is solid. Now, to code it.\n\nBut how to handle the multiplicative approach in code? Let's think.\n\nFor example, for m=5, n=5:\n\ntotal = 5+5-2 =8.\n\nk = 4, since m-1=4, n-1=4. Then, the combination is 8!/(4!4!) =70, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, for the code: for a = total and b = k, the combination.\n\nImplement a function to compute the combination (a choose b) in an efficient way.\n\nWait, but a must be >= b, right? Because in our case, total is (m-1 +n-1) and k is the smaller of the two subtracted by 1.\n\nWait, when you say k is the smaller of (m-1, n-1), let me see. For example, in the case m=2, n=2: m-1 and n-1 are both 1. So k is 1.\n\nIf m=1 and n=2, then k is 0: because m-1 is 0, n-1 is 1, and 0 is smaller.\n\nSo in code:\n\na = (m-1) + (n-1)\n\nk = min(m-1, n-1)\n\nThen, compute C(a, k) = product from i=1 to k of (a - k + i ) / i.\n\nWait, let's think about that.\n\nC(a, k) is the same as the product for i from 1 to k of (a - k + i) / i.\n\nYes, because (a choose k) = (a*(a-1)*...*(a -k +1 )) / (k*(k-1)*...*1 ).\n\nWhich is equivalent to product from i=1 to k of (a -k +i ) / i.\n\nSo for example:\n\nC(4,2) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\n\nUsing the formula: i runs from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1: (4-2+1) = 3, divided by 1: 3/1=3.\n\ni=2: (4-2+2)=4, divided by 2: 4/2=2.\n\nMultiply 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nWhich works.\n\nSo in code, we can compute C(a, k) using this product.\n\nLet me try to code that.\n\nFunction count_paths(m, n):\n\nCompute a = m + n - 2\n\nk = min(m-1, n-1)\n\nIf k ==0: return 1\n\nElse:\n\nresult = 1\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    result = result * (a - k + i) // i\n\nReturn result\n\nWait, why floor division? Because each step in the product, the multiplication is multiple of (numerator) and then division, which gives an integer each time. So it should always result in integer, so we can safely use integer division.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nSample 1: m=2, n=2:\n\na = 2+2-2 =2\n\nk = min(1,1) =1\n\ni from 1 to 1:\n\ni=1:\n\nresult = 1 * (2-1 +1) / 1 = 1 * 2 /1= 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 2: m=3, n=3:\n\na =3+3-2=4\n\nk=2\n\ni runs from 1 to 2.\n\ni=1:\n\nresult =1 * (4-2+1)/1 = 3/1=3.\n\ni=2:\n\n3 * (4-2+2)/2 = 3*(4)/2 = 3*2=6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSample 3: m=5, n=5: a=8, k=4.\n\nCompute [8-4+1=5] * 6 *7 *8 divided by 1*2*3*4.\n\nWait:\n\ni from 1 to 4:\n\ni=1: 5/1, result=5.\n\ni=2: 6/2=3, result=5*3=15.\n\ni=3: 7/3: wait 15*7 is 105, divided by 3=35.\n\ni=4: 8/4=2: 35*2=70.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother sample: m=1, n=10.\n\na=1+10-2=9.\n\nk = min(0,9) =0. So return 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: m=10, n=1:\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, to code it.\n\nImplement it in Python.\n\nI can handle the case when m-1 or n-1 is zero.\n\nWait, if m is 1, then k is min(0, n-1) =0, so function returns 1.\n\nSame for n=1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n\nWait, no need for special case if k is zero: in the for loop, range(1,1) is 0 loops, so returns 1.\n\nWait for k=0: the loop runs from 1 to 0, which in Python, the range is empty. So loop doesn't run, and result remains 1, as intended.\n\nBut wait, our initial setup is to compute the product. So if a is zero, and k is zero, but a choose 0 is 1, correct.\n\nSo the code should just handle it uniformly.\n\nThus, the code can be written without checking if k is zero.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\ndef count_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n\n    a = m + n -2\n\n    k = min(m-1, n-1)\n\n    result =1\n\n    for i in range(1, k+1):\n\n        result = result * (a - k +i) // i\n\n    return result\n\nTesting this.\n\nAnother sample: m=1, n=1. Let's think: it's a 1x1 grid, but the start and end are the same point. So the number of paths is 1. The code: a=0, k=0, which return 1, correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=3, n=2: 3 rows and 2 columns.\n\nSo grid points are (0,0) to (2,1).\n\nThe required moves: 2 downs and 1 right, possible paths is 3: R D D, D R D, D D R.\n\nSo code: a=2+1=3, k=1 (min(2,1)=1).\n\ni=1:\n\n(3-1 +1) * result /i.\n\nCompute (3-1 +1=3) /1: 3.\n\nSo result is 3. Correct.\n\nYes, so the code should handle that.\n\nThus, I think this should be the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an M x N grid, where movement is restricted to only right or down directions.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing that each path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner consists of a series of right and down moves. Specifically, we need to make exactly (M-1) down moves and (N-1) right moves. The number of unique paths is equivalent to the number of ways we can arrange these moves, which is a combinatorial problem.\n\nThe key insight is that the number of unique paths can be computed using the binomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways to choose (M-1) down moves (or equivalently (N-1) right moves) from a total of (M-1 + N-1) moves. This can be computed efficiently using a multiplicative approach to avoid large intermediate values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    a = m + n - 2\n    k = min(m - 1, n - 1)\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        result = result * (a - k + i) // i\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem is reduced to finding the number of ways to arrange (M-1) down moves and (N-1) right moves, which is a combinatorial problem.\n2. **Binomial Coefficient**: The number of unique paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(M+N-2, k), where k is the smaller of (M-1) and (N-1). This avoids large intermediate values and ensures efficient computation.\n3. **Efficient Computation**: The binomial coefficient is computed using a multiplicative approach, iterating from 1 to k and updating the result at each step. This method ensures that we handle large numbers gracefully by performing division at each step to keep intermediate results manageable.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of unique paths using combinatorial mathematics, ensuring correctness and optimal performance even for larger values of M and N.",
