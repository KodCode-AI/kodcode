  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an MxN grid. The movement is restricted to only down or right. Hmm, let me think.\n\nSo, the examples given: for a 2x2 grid, there are 2 paths. For 3x3, it's 6. Wait, how does that work? Let me visualize the 2x2 grid. Starting at top-left, which is (0,0) if I consider it as a grid with indices. To get to (1,1), which is the bottom-right, I can either move right then down, or down then right. So that's two options. Makes sense.\n\nFor a 3x3 grid, the starting point is (0,0) and the end is (2,2). So the number of paths would be the number of ways to arrange a certain number of rights and downs. Like, to get from start to end, how many steps right and down do I need?\n\nWait, the grid is M x N. Does that mean it's a grid with M rows and N columns? Or is it the other way around? Because in the example, count_paths(1,10) is 1, which suggests that it's a single row, and you can only move right, so only one path. Similarly, a 10x1 grid is a single column.\n\nSo in general, moving from (0,0) to (m-1, n-1) because M is rows and N is columns. Or wait, maybe it's the other way. Let me clarify: when you have an MxN grid, the number of moves would be (M-1) down moves and (N-1) right moves.\n\nBecause think about a 2x2 grid: to go from top-left to bottom-right, you need to move once down and once right. So total of 2 moves, choosing 1 to be down, which is 2 choose 1 equals 2. Which matches the first example.\n\nSo generalizing, for an M x N grid, you have (M-1 + N-1) total steps, choosing (M-1) of them to be down moves. Because the rest will automatically be right moves.\n\nSo the mathematical formula would be the combination of (M-1 + N-1) steps taken (M-1) at a time. So the number of paths is C(M+N-2, M-1) which is the same as C(M+N-2, N-1).\n\nLet's see the examples:\n\nFor 2x2: C(2+2-2, 2-1) = C(2,1) = 2. Correct.\n\nFor 3x3: C(3+3-2, 3-1) = C(4,2)=6. Correct.\n\nFor 5x5: C(5+5-2,5-1)=C(8,4)=70. Correct.\n\nFor 1x10: C(1+10-2, 1-1) = C(9,0)=1.\n\nWait, combination of 9 choose 0 is 1 yeah. Correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the binomial coefficient C(m+n-2, m-1) or equivalently C(m+n-2, n-1), whichever is smaller to compute efficiency.\n\nSo the function count_paths should compute this binomial coefficient.\n\nBut how to compute it efficiently.\n\nHmm, in Python, perhaps using the math.comb function. Like, in Python 3.10 and above, math.comb(n, k) returns the binomial coefficient.\n\nSo the code can be as simple as:\n\nimport math\n\ndef count_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    return math.comb(m + n - 2, m - 1)\n\nWait, but what about when m is 0 or n is 0? Well, the constraints aren't given, but looking at the examples, m and n are at least 1. So with m=1, n=1, the grid is 1x1, so only one cell, so zero steps needed. So what? Let's see, math.comb(1+1-2,1-1) = math.comb(0, 0) which is 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo for a 1x1 grid, the count is 1 path, which is correct.\n\nAnother test: let's say m=3, n=2. So, number of steps: 3-1 + 2-1=3 steps. Number of down moves: 2, right moves 1. So C(3,2)=3.\n\nTesting that:\n\ncount_paths(3,2) should return 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the implementation can rely on the math.comb function, which efficiently computes the binomial coefficient.\n\nSo the code should be as above, but since m and n can be large what about handling cases where m or n is 0? Probably, but since the problem's test cases don't include those, perhaps it's not an issue. But math.comb will raise an error if the first argument is smaller than the second, but in our case, the function is m+n-2 choose m-1, but because m and n are positive integers, it's either valid.\n\nWait, no. Wait, m and n can be any positive integers, so m+n-2 could be large but the second argument is min(m-1, n-1), perhaps better to compute it as the smaller of the two to optimize. For example, choosing the smaller between (m-1) and (n-1) as the k parameter to the comb function.\n\nBecause for comb(n, k), when k is larger than n/2, it's more efficient to compute comb(n, n-k).\n\nBut perhaps the math.comb function in Python handles that internally.\n\nSo the code is as I wrote.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\ncount_paths(2,2) \u2192 math.comb(2+2-2,2-1)=math.comb(2,1)=2 \u2192 correct.\n\ncount_paths(3,3) \u2192 math.comb(4,2)=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, this should handle all cases.\n\nSo the function can be written concisely.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an MxN grid, where movement is restricted to only right or down directions.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using combinatorial mathematics. The key observation is that any path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of an MxN grid requires exactly (M-1) downward moves and (N-1) rightward moves. The number of unique paths is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange these moves, which can be computed using the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient, denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. In this problem, we need to compute C(M+N-2, M-1), which gives the number of ways to choose (M-1) downward moves from a total of (M+N-2) moves (the sum of downward and rightward moves).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    return math.comb(m + n - 2, m - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding the number of unique paths in a grid where movement is restricted to right or down directions only.\n2. **Combinatorial Insight**: The number of unique paths can be determined by computing the number of ways to arrange (M-1) downward moves and (N-1) rightward moves.\n3. **Binomial Coefficient**: Using the binomial coefficient C(M+N-2, M-1) gives the number of ways to choose (M-1) positions for downward moves out of the total (M+N-2) moves.\n4. **Efficiency**: The combinatorial approach efficiently computes the result using the math.comb function, which is optimized for performance.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately and efficiently compute the number of unique paths for any given grid dimensions M and N.",
