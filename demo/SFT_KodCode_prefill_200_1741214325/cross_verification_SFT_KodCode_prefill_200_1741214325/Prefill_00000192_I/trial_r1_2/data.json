  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called first_repeating_char that takes a string and returns the first character that repeats. If there's no repeating character, it should return -1. Hmm, how should I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the example given: \"programming\". The first repeating character is 'r'. So the function should return 'r' for that input. But wait, what about the order? I need to find the first occurrence where a character repeats when scanning the string from left to right. So the earliest position where a character appears again after its initial occurrence.\n\nHow can I track which characters have been seen and check if they appear again? Maybe I can use a dictionary to keep track of the characters and their positions. Oh, but maybe a set would be more efficient since I just need to know if a character has been seen before.\n\nWait, so as I iterate through each character in the string, I can check if it's already in the set. If it is, then I've found a repeating character. The first such character encountered is the one I need to return immediately.\n\nAlternatively, I need to keep track of the order in which characters were repeated. Maybe, but that might complicate things. Since we want the first character that repeats, it's when we encounter it the second time if it's already been seen once.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of characters we've seen.\n2. Iterate through each character in the string one by one.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in the set.\n   a. If yes, return this character as it's the first repeating one.\n   b. If no, add it to the set.\n4. If the loop completes without finding any repeating character, return -1.\n\nBut wait, let me test this logic with the example. \"programming\"\n\nLetters in order: p, r, o, g, r, a, m, m, i, n, g.\n\nFirst pass:\np -> not seen, add to set.\nr -> not seen, add.\no -> no, add.\ng -> no, add.\nr -> yes, already in set. So return 'r'. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"abba\"\n\na: not seen, add.\nb: not, add.\nb: seen. Return 'b'.\n\nAnother case: \"abcde\", all unique. Should return -1.\n\nAnother test: \"aabbcd\", the first repeat is the second 'a'? Wait, no:\n\nLet's see the order of processing: \n\na: added. \na: appears again, so the function returns 'a'.\n\nBut in \"abba\", the first repeat is 'b' when processing the second 'b', but the first character in the string that has a duplicate is 'a' which repeats later. Hmm, no, wait no: \n\nWait, the first repetition is the first occurrence where a character is seen again. So in \"abba\", when processing the second 'b', we return 'b' because it's the first time we encountered a repetition. So according to our logic above, it's correct.\n\nSo the function should return the first character (from the left) that has been encountered before when traversing from left to right.\n\nSo, yes, using a set and returning the first duplicate we find should work.\n\nSo the function can be written as follows:\n\nCreate an empty set, loop through each character in the input string. For each char:\n\nif char is in the set, return it.\nelse, add to the set.\n\nIf the loop finishes without returning, return -1.\n\nWait, that should solve the problem.\n\nLet me think about \"aabb\". \n\nProcessing:\na: not in set, add.\na: now in set, return 'a'.\n\nOkay, correct.\n\nAnother test case: \"hello\". The function should return 'l' because when we process the second 'l' (after the first 'h', 'e', 'l' was added, so the next 'l' is returned.\n\nSo, code-wise, function definition is:\n\ndef first_repeating_char(s):\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n\nWait, that's the code. But let me test.\n\nWait, but in the example, in \"programming\", after processing 'p', 'r', 'o', 'g', then 'r' is found again, returns 'r' as expected.\n\nWhat about a string like \"abac\"? So the first repeat is 'a', since the first 'a' is added, then 'b' added, 'a' is found again. So function returns 'a', which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in \"abac\", the first repeating character is 'a' at position 2 (0-indexed index 2), which is correct.\n\nAnother point of view: some might think it's the first character that has a duplicate, which is correct because as soon as any character is found again, it's the earliest such.\n\nI think this logic works.\n\nBut wait another test case: \"abba\".\n\nString is ['a','b','b','a'].\n\nProcessing:\n\na -> not in set: add.\n\nb -> not in set: add.\n\nb -> now in set, return 'b'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo yes, this function should work.\n\nSo, implement that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that identifies the first repeating character in a given string. If no character repeats, the function should return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently involves using a set to keep track of the characters we have seen so far as we iterate through the string. This allows us to quickly check if a character has been encountered before. \n\nHere are the steps in detail:\n\n1. **Initialize a Set**: Create an empty set named `seen` to keep track of characters that have been processed.\n2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the string one by one.\n3. **Check for Repeating Character**: For each character, check if it is already in the set. If it is, return this character immediately as it is the first repeating character.\n4. **Update the Set**: If the character is not in the set, add it to the set.\n5. **Return -1 if No Repeats**: If the loop completes without finding any repeating characters, return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the first repeating character with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef first_repeating_char(s):\n    seen = set()\n    for char in s:\n        if char in seen:\n            return char\n        seen.add(char)\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `first_repeating_char` works as follows:\n\n- **Set Initialization**: The set `seen` is initialized to keep track of characters as they are encountered.\n- **Character Iteration**: For each character in the input string `s`, the function checks if the character exists in the `seen` set.\n- **Check and Return**: If a character is found in the `seen` set, it is returned immediately, indicating that it is the first repeating character.\n- **Set Update**: If a character is not found in the `seen` set, it is added to the set to track it for future checks.\n- **No Repeats Handling**: If the loop completes without finding any repeating characters, the function returns -1.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles both cases where there are repeating characters and where there are none, ensuring optimal performance.",
