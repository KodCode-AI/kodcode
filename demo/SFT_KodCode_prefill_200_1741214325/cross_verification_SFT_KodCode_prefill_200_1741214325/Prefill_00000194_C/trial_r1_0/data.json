  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to write a Python function called string_to_ascii_list that converts a given string into a list of integers. Each integer should be the ASCII value of each character in the string. So, for example, if the input is \"AB\", the output should be [65, 66]. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, each character can be converted to its ASCII value using the ord() function. So, for each character in the input string, I can apply ord() to get the ASCII code.\n\nBut I need to collect all these ASCII values into a list. So the process would involve iterating over each character in the string and then converting it.\n\nWait, how about if the input string is empty? Oh right, in that case, the function should return an empty list. So I need to handle that scenario too.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Initialize an empty list to hold the ASCII values.\n2. Loop through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, compute its ASCII value using ord().\n4. Append this value to the list.\n5. After processing all characters, return the list.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a list comprehension to make this concise. Instead of initializing a list and appending in a loop, I can create the list in one line. That might be more efficient and cleaner.\n\nSo the list comprehension would look something like [ord(char) for char in input_string]. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, what about when the input is None? But looking at the examples, the function is called with a string, and I guess the parameter is of type str, so it should handle the empty string, but what if someone passes None somehow? But according to the function signature, it expects a str, so that's probably handled elsewhere. So I don't need to worry about that.\n\nTesting some examples:\n\nFor \"AB\", the loop would take 'A' then 'B'. ord('A') is 65, ord('B') is 66. So the list becomes [65,66], which matches the example.\n\nAnother example is \"Hello\". H is 72, e is 101, each l is 108, and o is 111. The output is [72,101,108,108,111], which is correct.\n\nIf the input is empty string, the list comprehension would create an empty list, which is exactly what we want.\n\nWhat about numbers like \"123\"? The ASCII for '1' is 49, '2' is 50, and '3' is 51. So the output is [49,50,51], as in the example.\n\nI think that's correct. So putting it all together, the function can be written succinctly with a list comprehension.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    return [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n\nWait, but should I import List from typing? Oh, the function signature already includes List[int], so I need to make sure that the return type is a list of integers. Using the list comprehension achieves that.\n\nYes, this should work. I don't see any edge cases I'm missing. Even empty strings are handled correctly.\n\nTherefore, the function can be implemented as simply returning the list of ordinals for each character in the input string.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given string into a list of integers, where each integer represents the ASCII value of each character in the string. This can be efficiently achieved using Python's built-in functions and list comprehensions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding ASCII Conversion**: Each character in a string can be converted to its corresponding ASCII value using Python's `ord()` function.\n2. **List Comprehension**: We can iterate over each character in the input string using a list comprehension. For each character, we compute its ASCII value using `ord()` and collect these values into a list.\n3. **Handling Empty Strings**: If the input string is empty, the list comprehension will naturally result in an empty list, which is the correct output for this case.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient, concise, and handles all edge cases, including empty strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    return [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, it applies the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value and constructs a list of these values.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because list comprehensions in Python are optimized for performance and readability.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles an empty input string by returning an empty list, as the list comprehension will naturally yield an empty list in this case.\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand, providing the correct output for any given string input.",
