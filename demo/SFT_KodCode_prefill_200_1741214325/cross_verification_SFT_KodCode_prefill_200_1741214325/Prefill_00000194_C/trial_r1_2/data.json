  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called string_to_ascii_list that takes an input string and converts it into a list of integers. Each integer should be the ASCII value of each character in the string. Let's see, the examples provided show that, for instance, \"AB\" becomes [65, 66] and \"Hello\" becomes [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]. So the function should process each character in the input string, get its ASCII code, and collect all these codes into a list.\n\nHmm, how to approach this. Well, in Python, each character can be converted to its ASCII value using the ord() function. So for each character in the input string, I can apply ord() to it and add the result to the list.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n1. Initialize an empty list to store the ASCII values.\n2. Loop through each character in the input string.\n3. For each character, append its ASCII value (using ord()) to the list.\n4. Return the list after processing all characters.\n\nBut wait, what about an empty string? If the input is \"\", the function should return an empty list, which aligns with the initial approach since the loop won't run and the empty list is returned.\n\nLet me think about the code structure. I'll start by defining the function with the correct parameters. The function is supposed to take a string, so the parameter is input_string: str, and it should return a list of integers, so the return type is List[int].\n\nNow, inside the function:\n\nInitialize an empty list:\nascii_list = []\n\nThen loop through each character in input_string. In Python, for char in input_string: ...\n\nInside the loop, append the ordinal value of the character to ascii_list:\nascii_list.append(ord(char))\n\nAfter processing all characters, return ascii_list.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function would look like:\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    ascii_list = []\n    for char in input_string:\n        ascii_list.append(ord(char))\n    return ascii_list\n\nWait, but maybe we can make this even more concise with a list comprehension. Like, [ord(char) for char in input_string]. That could replace the loop entirely.\n\nLet me think: input_string is a string, so when we iterate over it, each element is a character. So using list comprehension, we can create the list directly without initializing and looping with append.\n\nSo the function could be written more concisely as:\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    return [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n\nThat seems much cleaner. Let's test this logic with the examples.\n\nTest case 1: \"AB\" should return [65, 66]. Using the list comprehension: 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66. That works.\n\nTest case 2: \"Hello\". H is 72, e is 101, two l's are 108 each, o is 111. So [72, 101, 108, 108, 111]. Correct.\n\nTest case 3: \"\" returns [], which is handled since the list comprehension over an empty string gives an empty list.\n\nTest case 4: \"123\" should give the ASCII values for '1', '2', '3', which are 49, 50, 51. Correct.\n\nI think this should cover all the cases. Now, I should also consider if there are any edge cases, like strings with special characters or non-printable characters. Since the function just converts each character, regardless of what it is, it should handle all cases. If the input is None, wait, no: the function expects a string. If by mistake, someone passes a non-string, like None, it would throw an error, but according to the problem statement, the input is a string, so perhaps we don't need to handle that.\n\nAnother thought: do I need to import List from typing? Because the function's return type is List[int]. So the code should have from typing import List. Otherwise, the code would throw a NameError. So I need to make sure to include that.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem's example code shows the function starting with def, but the imports are probably handled by the user. So does the code that's written need to include the import?\n\nIn the problem statement, the function is given as:\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    ...\n\nBut if I were to write this, I'd need to have imported List from typing. Otherwise, it's NameError: name 'List' is not defined.\n\nBut in some Python versions, the use of List in the type hint is allowed as long as it's from the typing module. So perhaps in the actual code to write, I need to include from typing import List.\n\nSo, to make the function correct, the code should have that import.\n\nSo overall, putting it all together, the complete code would be:\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    return [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n\nI think that should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts a given string into a list of integers, where each integer represents the ASCII value of each character in the string. Each character in the string is processed individually, and its ASCII value is determined using Python's built-in `ord()` function. The results are collected into a list which is then returned.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1. **Initialize an empty list**: This list will store the ASCII values of the characters from the input string.\n2. **Iterate over each character**: For each character in the input string, determine its ASCII value using the `ord()` function.\n3. **Collect ASCII values**: Append each ASCII value to the list initialized in step 1.\n4. **Return the list**: After processing all characters, return the list containing the ASCII values.\n\nTo make the solution concise and efficient, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each character and convert it to its ASCII value directly within the list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef string_to_ascii_list(input_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    return [ord(char) for char in input_string]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Importing List**: The `List` type from the `typing` module is imported to specify the return type of the function, indicating that the function returns a list of integers.\n- **Function Definition**: The function `string_to_ascii_list` takes a single parameter `input_string` of type `str` and returns a `List[int]`.\n- **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[ord(char) for char in input_string]` iterates over each character in the input string, converts each character to its ASCII value using `ord()`, and constructs a list of these values.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles an empty string by naturally returning an empty list, as the list comprehension will generate no elements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and concise, effectively converting each character of the input string to its corresponding ASCII value.",
