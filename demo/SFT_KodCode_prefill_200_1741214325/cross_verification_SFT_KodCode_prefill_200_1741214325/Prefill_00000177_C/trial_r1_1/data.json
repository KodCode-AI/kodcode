  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called quick_sort that takes a list of integers and returns a sorted list using the Quick Sort algorithm. Hmm, let's think about how Quick Sort works.\n\nSo, the basic idea is to pick a pivot element and then partition the array into elements less than or equal to the pivot and greater than the pivot. Then, recursively sort both partitions and combine them.\n\nWait, but how do I choose the pivot? Oh right, different strategies can be used like selecting the first element, last element, middle element, or even a random one. Maybe for simplicity, I can choose the middle element or the first element.\n\nBut in some cases, picking a bad pivot can lead to O(n^2) time, like when the array is already sorted. But for the scope of this problem, maybe the basic approach is sufficient.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Base case: If the array is empty or has one element, return it as is because it's already sorted.\n2. Otherwise, choose a pivot.\n3. Partition the array into elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater.\n4. Recursively quick_sort the left and right partitions.\n5. Combine the sorted left, the pivot(s), and the sorted right.\n\nWait, how do I choose the pivot? Let's say I pick the middle element as the pivot for better average-case performance. Or maybe the first element for simplicity. Wait, since the examples include various cases including negative numbers and duplicates, the partitioning needs to handle those.\n\nWait, in the partitioning step, do I split into less than, equal to, and greater than? Or just less than or equal and greater than. Because for duplicates, having a separate equal section can help group the same elements together.\n\nSo maybe I should split into three parts: elements less than pivot, equal to pivot, and greater than.\n\nSo the function for partitioning could return these three groups.\n\nWait, but in the recursive step, I can just handle the less than and greater than parts, and the pivot will naturally be in the middle once both are sorted.\n\nWait, another approach: the standard quicksort partitioning step rearranges the elements around a pivot such that all elements less than are on the left, and all greater are on the right. But this is an in-place approach. Since I'm implementing it in Python with a function that returns a new list, maybe the out-of-place approach is better.\n\nSo in each recursive call:\n\n- select a pivot (e.g., the first element)\n- create two lists: one for elements <= pivot, the other for elements > pivot.\n\nWait wait, no, because the division is usually into elements less than pivot and greater than. But if I include the pivot in one side, then it can lead to incorrect handling. Hmm, perhaps it's better to split into elements less than pivot, and elements greater than or equal. Or perhaps equal elements can be handled by including equal in left or right.\n\nAlternatively, in this case, for the base case, if the array is length 0 or 1, return it. Else, pick a pivot, create left as all elements less than or equal to pivot (excluding pivot itself?), then create right as all elements greater than the pivot. Wait no, that would not be correct.\n\nWait, maybe the steps are:\n\nGiven the list:\n\n- pick a pivot (like the first element, arr[0])\n- create a left list containing all elements less than pivot (but not including the pivot)\n- create a right list containing all elements greater than pivot\n- include the pivot(s) in their own list, which might be a single element or multiple if there are duplicates\nWait, but in the initial approach it's better to not include the pivot in left or right, and then have it added in the middle.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nThe function works as follows:\n\n- if the array is of length 1 or less, return it.\n\nElse:\n\n- pick a pivot (let's say the middle element)\n- create a list called 'left' which contains all elements less than the pivot\n- create 'right' which contains elements greater than the pivot\n- and 'mid' which contains elements equal to the pivot.\n\nThen, the sorted array is the quick_sort of left + mid + quick_sort of right.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because then, when you sort the left and right and sandwich the pivot(s) in between, you get a sorted array.\n\nSo for example, if the array is [3,6,8,10,1,2,1], what's the process? Let's see:\n\nSuppose we pick the middle element as the pivot. Well, for [3,6,8,10,1,2,1], middle element at index 3 is 10.\n\nLeft would be [3,6,8,1,2,1], right would be [] (since nothing is greater than 10).\n\nSo mid is [10].\n\nThen, quick_sort(left) is called. Wait, but 10 being the largest element is just the pivot, and left is everything else.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative is choosing the first element as the pivot. Let's try that.\n\nSo the steps would vary based on the pivot selection.\n\nWait, perhaps for simplicity, let me choose the first element as the pivot.\n\nSo for the list, first element is 3.\n\nLeft becomes the elements less than 3: [1,2,1]\n\nMid becomes elements equal to 3: [3]\n\nRight becomes elements greater than 3: [6,8,10]\n\nThen, recursively sort left and right.\n\nQuick_sort(left) would sort [1,2,1], which after choosing pivot 1, left is [], mid [1], right [2,1]. So that would lead to sorting [2,1], and so on.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, so in the code:\n\nWe can split the array into left, mid, right.\n\nLet me think about the implementation.\n\nSo for the given array:\n\nIf it's empty, return empty.\n\nElse, pick the first element (arr[0]) as pivot.\n\nThen, for each element in arr:\n\n- if it's less than pivot: add to left.\n\n- if equal to pivot: add to mid.\n\n- else (greater): add to right.\n\nThen, return quick_sort(left) + mid + quick_sort(right).\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    mid = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + mid + quick_sort(right)\n\nTesting this logic.\n\nLet's test with the first example: [3,6,8,10,1,2,1].\n\nAfter first partition: pivot is 3, left is [1,2,1], mid [3], right [6,8,10].\n\nNow, quick_sort([1,2,1]):\n\npivot is 1, left = [1,2,1] starts as elements less than 1 \u2192 which is nothing \u2192 left is empty.\n\nmid has elements equal to 1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nWait, no: in the list [1,2,1], the pivot is 1. So elements less than 1 are 0, but there are none. So left is empty. mid is [1,1,1]? Wait no, wait the initial array is [1,2,1]. So the elements are 1, 2, 1.\n\nSo in the left, x < 1: none.\n\nmid: x == 1 \u2192 two 1s (positions 0 and 2).\n\nRight: x > 1 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the new partition is left = [], mid = [1,1], right = [2].\n\nSo return quick_sort([]) + [1,1] + quick_sort([2]).\n\nWhich is [] + [1,1] + [2], so [1,1,2].\n\nSo when we go back to the higher level, the quick_sort(left) returns [1,1,2], and quick_sort(right) is called on [6,8,10], which is already sorted.\n\nSo the overall is [1,1,2] + [3] + [6,8,10] \u2192 [1,1,2,3,6,8,10], which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [-3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2, -1].\n\nFirst pivot is -3.\n\nLeft has elements x < -3: -6, -8, -10.\n\nmid is [-3].\n\nright has elements x > -3: -1, -2, -1.\n\nQuick_sort the left [-6,-8,-10]:\n\nPivot is -6. Left is elements < -6 \u2192 -8, -10. Mid [-6]. Right is empty.\n\nQuick_sort left [-8,-10], pivot is -8 \u2192 left is [-10], mid [-8], right empty.\n\nQuick_sort left [-10] returns itself.\n\nSo the sorted left is [-10, -8, -6].\n\nMid is [-3].\n\nThen, the right [-1, -2, -1] is processed.\n\nRecursive call on right:\n\nPivot is -1.\n\nWait, no. pivot is first element of the right array: the right array is [-1, -2, -1].\n\npivot is -1.\n\nLeft is x < -1 \u2192 [-2], mid is [ -1, -1], right is [].\n\nQuick_sort(left) \u2192 sorts [-2] \u2192 [-2].\n\nSo the right sorted is [-2, -1, -1].\n\nPutting it all together: left sorted is [-10,-8,-6], mid [-3], right sorted is [-2, -1, -1]. So the result is [-10,-8,-6,-3,-2,-1,-1], but wait the sample says [-10,-8,-6,-3,-2,-1,-1], same as this.\n\nWait wait, the sample output is [-10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, -1]. So that matches.\n\nAnother test case: [3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2, 1]\n\nFirst pivot is 3.\n\nLeft is [-6,-10,-2,1,1].\n\nright is [8].\n\nSorting left:\n\nleft is [-6,-10,-2,1,1].\n\nPivot is -6.\n\nElements less than -6 are -10, which becomes left. mid is [-6], right is elements > -6: [-2,1,1].\n\nQuick_sort left is [-10, -6]. Because the left array is [-10], which is already sorted. Mid is [-6].\n\nNow the right [-2,1,1].\n\nPivot is -2.\n\nLeft has elements < -2 \u2192 none.\n\nmid is [-2].\n\nright is [1,1], which is already sorted.\n\nSo the sorted right is [-2,1,1].\n\nPutting left sorted [-10], mid [-6], right sorted [-2,1,1].\n\nSo the sorted left array is [-10, -6, -2,1,1, 3, 8].\n\nWait, wait: let me retrace.\n\nWait in this case, the initial array is [3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2,1]. The first pivot is 3.\n\nLeft is elements <=3 and less than 3. Hmm no, wait in the code, left is x < pivot, mid x == pivot, right x>p.\n\nLeft is [ -6,-10,1,-2,1], right is [8].\n\nWait wait, no: wait 3 is the pivot.\n\nSo all elements in the array: 3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2,1.\n\nCompare each:\n\n-6 <3 \u2192 left.\n\n-10 <3 \u2192 left.\n\n1 <3 \u2192 left.\n\n-2 <3 \u2192 left.\n\nWait no, 1 is 1 <3. Wait 1 <3 is true. So yes.\n\nSo left becomes [-6, -10, 1, -2, 1].\n\nWait including 1 and 1?\n\nBecause 1 <3.\n\nSo yes. So the left is 5 elements: -6, -10,1,-2,1.\n\nThen, the right is 8.\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\noriginal array when initial call is [3,-6,8,-10,1,-2,1]:\n\nx <3: -6, 8? No, 8>3. Wait, wait, when we go through each element:\n\n3 is the pivot.\n\niterating over all elements of arr (include 3 in mid).\n\nSo for each x in arr:\n\nif x <3 \u2192 add to left.\n\nx ==3 \u2192 mid.\n\nx>3 \u2192 right.\n\nSo the elements:\n\n3: mid.\n\n-6: left.\n\n8: right.\n\n-10: left.\n\n1: left.\n\n-2: left.\n\n1: left.\n\nSo left is [-6, -10,1,-2,1,], and right is [8].\n\nMid is [3].\n\nSo quick_sort(left): what's inside it.\n\nLeft is [-6,-10,1,-2,1].\n\nSo pivot is -6.\n\nx < -6 \u2192 elements < -6: -10 is the only one.\n\nothers > -6: 1, -2, 1.\n\nSo in this case:\n\nleft of the left: [-10].\n\nmid: [-6].\n\nright: [1, -2,1, etc? Wait no.\n\nWait, no, in this call, the array is [-6, -10,1,-2,1].\n\nPivot is -6.\n\nx < pivot: elements < -6 is -10.\n\nx == pivot: only -6.\n\nx> pivot: 1, -2, 1, because 1>-6, -2> -6 (since -2 is -2 is greater than -6).\n\nSo left here is [-10], mid is [-6], right is [1,-2,1, wait no, the array is [-6,-10,1,-2,1].\n\nSo in the list, x> -6 is all elements except for -10 and -6.\n\nSo elements after -6 in this call:\n\n-10 is < pivot \u2192 left.\n\nWait, wait, the array is: [-6, -10, 1, -2, 1]. So all these are sub-elements in the left from the initial call.\n\nSo for each x in this array:\n\nx < pivot (-6): yes, -10.\n\nx == pivot: -6.\n\nx> pivot: 1, -2, 1.\n\nSo left is [-10], right is [1,-2,1].\n\nSo the quick_sort(left) is [-10].\n\nThe right is [1,-2,1].\n\nPivot is 1.\n\nSo in the right call, pivot is 1.\n\nx <1 \u2192 -2.\n\nx ==1 \u2192 [1,1].\n\nx>1 \u2192 none.\n\nSo left is [-2], right is empty.\n\nSo quick_sort(left] is [-2], and quick_sort(right) is []. So the right array becomes [-2,1,1].\n\nPutting it all together in the left call: quick_sort(left) + mid + quick_sort(right).\n\nWhich is [-10], mid is [-6], right sorted is [-2,1,1].\n\nSo combining: [-10] + [-6] + [-2,1,1] \u2192 [-10, -6, -2, 1,1].\n\nThen, the initial left was this array, and the right was [8]. Then, the mid is [3].\n\nSo the overall array is:\n\nsorted(left) + mid + sorted(right) \u2192 [-10,-6,-2,1,1] + [3] + [8] \u2192 as expected.\n\nWait the sample output is [-10, -6, -2, 1, 1, 3, 8], which matches.\n\nSo the code outline seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait but wait, in code, the left array is [x for x in arr if x < pivot], mid [x == pivot], right [x > pivot]\n\nYes. Also, the duplicates are handled correctly.\n\nAnother test case: []. quick_sort([]) returns [], which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [5]. returns [5].\n\nSo this seems to handle all the samples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nImplement the steps as:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    mid = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + mid + quick_sort(right)\n\nWait but wait\u2014shouldn't the mid contain all elements equal to the pivot, including those in the original array beyond the first occurrence? Because in the example where the array has multiple equals, the mid grows.\n\nYes, because for each x in the array, including duplicates, the mid will include all equal to the pivot.\n\nBut wait, in the initial code, mid is [x for x in arr if x == pivot], which is all elements equal to the original pivot.\n\nYes. So for each step, all elements equal to the pivot are included in mid. But since in the partition, the left and right arrays won't include the elements equal to the pivot (because left is x < pivot, right x> ), but the mid is exact equals.\n\nWait this could be a problem if there are multiple instances of the pivot, but in the code, it's accounted for by mid including all x == pivot.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the pivot should not be the first element, perhaps using a different method like choosing the middle, but for the sake of simplicity, the first element is chosen.\n\nBut this could lead to poor performance on certain cases, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the Quick Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than the pivot, equal to the pivot, and greater than the pivot. The process is then repeated recursively on the sub-arrays of elements less than and greater than the pivot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case**: If the array is empty or has only one element, it is already sorted, so return it as is.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose the first element of the array as the pivot for simplicity.\n3. **Partitioning**: Split the array into three parts:\n   - `left`: Elements less than the pivot.\n   - `mid`: Elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `right`: Elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the Quick Sort algorithm to the `left` and `right` partitions.\n5. **Combining Results**: Combine the sorted `left` partition, the `mid` pivot elements, and the sorted `right` partition to produce the final sorted array.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is in its correct position relative to the pivot, and the recursion handles the sorting of sub-arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    mid = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + mid + quick_sort(right)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: The function first checks if the array has zero or one element, in which case it returns the array immediately as it is already sorted.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: The first element of the array is selected as the pivot.\n3. **Partitioning**: The array is partitioned into three lists based on the pivot:\n   - `left` contains all elements less than the pivot.\n   - `mid` contains all elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `right` contains all elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: The function recursively sorts the `left` and `right` partitions.\n5. **Combining Results**: The sorted `left` partition, the `mid` elements (which are all the pivot values), and the sorted `right` partition are concatenated to form the final sorted array.\n\nThis method ensures that each element is placed in the correct order relative to the pivot, and the use of recursion allows the algorithm to handle increasingly smaller sub-problems until the entire array is sorted.",
