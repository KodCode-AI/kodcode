  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement the quick sort algorithm. I remember that quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. So, first, I should think about how to structure this function.\n\nThe function is called quick_sort and takes a list of integers as input. It should return a sorted list. So, maybe I'll start by handling the base case. If the array is empty or has only one element, just return it as it is. That makes sense because there's nothing to sort.\n\nNext, I recall that the key step in quick sort is choosing a pivot. Once the pivot is chosen, the array is partitioned into elements less than the pivot and those greater. But wait, sometimes equal elements are also considered, but I think in this function, they should go to one of the sides, probably to the left or right. Hmm.\n\nWait, the partitioning should split the array into elements less than or equal to the pivot on one side and greater on the other, or maybe strictly less and greater? Oh right, usually, in quicksort, elements equal to the pivot go to either left or right, depending on the implementation, but for simplicity, I think including them in the left or right might be easier. But for now, perhaps I should pick a pivot, then create two lists: one for elements less than the pivot and one for elements greater. Then recursively sort each of those and then combine pivot with the sorted less and greater lists.\n\nWait, but which pivot to choose? The easiest is to pick the first element, or maybe the middle, or the last. But for a simple implementation, picking the first or last is easier. Let's pick the first element as the pivot. So, for each array, pivot = arr[0].\n\nThen, for the rest of the elements (arr[1:]), separate them into less than and greater than the pivot.\n\nWait, what about elements equal to the pivot? I think including them in the less-than or greater-than group. For example, if we have multiple duplicates of the pivot, they should all end up together. So in the function, when we compare each element to the pivot, if it is less than, it goes to the left list; otherwise (greater or equal), to the right. Or is it better to have three lists: less, equal, and greater. Maybe that's a good approach to handle duplicates efficiently.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. If the array is empty or has one element, return it.\n\n2. Choose a pivot, say the first element.\n\n3. Create three lists:\n   a. Elements less than pivot.\n   b. Elements equal to pivot.\n   c. Elements greater than pivot.\n\n4. Recursively quick_sort the 'less' and 'greater' lists.\n\n5. Concatenate the sorted 'less' list, the 'equal' list, and the sorted 'greater' list.\n\nThat would handle duplicates correctly because all equal elements are in the middle.\n\nSo, how to implement this? Let me think about the code.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    less = []\n    equal = []\n    greater = []\n    for x in arr:\n        if x < pivot:\n            less.append(x)\n        elif x == pivot:\n            equal.append(x)\n        else:\n            greater.append(x)\n    # Now, recursively sort less and greater\n    less_sorted = quick_sort(less)\n    greater_sorted = quick_sort(greater)\n    # Combine\n    return less_sorted + equal + greater_sorted\n\nWait, wait\u2014 no, no. Because in the initial approach, I split into less, equal, and greater, but the function is quick sort. So, the 'equal' can just be added in the middle. So, this seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking back at the examples. For instance, the one with [3,6,8,10,1,2,1], the output is [1,1,2,3,6,8,10]. So when the function is applied, it correctly sorts.\n\nWait, let me test this logic on a simple example. Let's say arr = [3,1,4,1,5]. The pivot is 3.\n\nThen:\n\nelements:\n\n1: less\n1: less\n4: greater\n1: less\n5: greater\n\nWait no, no\u2014 sorry, I was thinking of the initial list as [3,1,4,1,5]. The elements would be traversed as 3,1,4,1,5.\n\nSo:\n\nx=3: equal, added to equal.\n\nx=1: less than 3, added to less.\n\nx=4: greater than 3, added to greater.\n\nx=1: less than 3.\n\nx=5: greater than 3.\n\nSo, less is [1,1], equal is [3], greater is [4,5].\n\nWait no, wait: initial pivot is 3. So when x=3, it's added to equal. The rest are, for x in the array, which includes the first '3' and the others.\n\nWait no\u2014 no. Because arr is [3,1,4,1,5]. So for loop x in arr:\n\nx=3 is equal, so added to equal. So equal becomes [3].\n\nThen x=1: added to less.\n\nx=4: added to greater.\n\nx=1: added to less.\n\nx=5: added to greater.\n\nSo, less is [1,1], equal [3], greater [4,5]. When recursively sorted.\n\nRecursively, quick_sort(less) \u2192 [1,1], quick_sort(greater) \u2192 [4,5].\n\nSo the final array is [1,1,3,4,5]. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this approach works.\n\nWait, but in Python, when you have an empty list, for example, when len(arr) is zero, the function returns correctly, as per the base case.\n\nTesting another example, when the list is [ -3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2, -1 ]. The expected output is [-10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, -1]. Let's see how the code would process this.\n\nPivot is the first element, which is -3.\n\nSo for each x in the array:\n\n-3 is equal \u2192 add to equal.\n\n-6 < -3 \u2192 add to less.\n\n-8 < -3 \u2192 add to less.\n\n-10 < -3 \u2192 add to less.\n\n-1 >-3 \u2192 add to greater.\n\n-2 >-3 (since -2 is greater than -3?), wait, no: -2 is bigger than -3? Yes. Because in terms of numbers, -2 is to the right of -3 on the number line. So -2 is greater than -3 \u2192 added to greater.\n\n-1 > -3 \u2192 added to greater.\n\nSo, less = [ -6, -8, -10 ], equal [ -3 ], greater [ -1, -2, -1 ].\n\nWait, wait: when x=-10, it's compared to -3: -10 < -3 \u2192 goes to less. So yes.\n\nThen, we sort the less and greater lists recursively.\n\nThe less list is [ -6, -8, -10 ], let's see:\n\npivot is -6. For x in this list:\n\n-6: equal \u2192 equal.\n\n-8: less than -6 \u2192 less.\n\n-10: less than -6 \u2192 less.\n\nSo, less is again called on [ -8, -10 ].\n\nIn quick_sort( [ -8, -10 ] ), pivot is -8. x=-10 is less than -8 \u2192 less. So less becomes [ -10 ], which is then sorted in the next level.\n\nSo after all that, less sorted is [ -10, -8, -6 ].\n\nThe greater list is [ -1, -2, -1 ]. Let's sort that.\n\nIn the first recursive call, the list is [ -1, -2, -1 ].\n\nPivot is -1. So x's:\n\n-1 is equal \u2192 added to equal.\n\n-2 < -1 \u2192 added to less.\n\n-1 is equal \u2192 added to equal.\n\nSo less is [ -2 ], greater is empty.\n\nSo the sorted less is [ -2 ], equal is [ -1, -1 ].\n\nThen, in the next level, when we combine, we get [ -2 ] + [ -1, -1 ] + [] = [ -2, -1, -1].\n\nWait, no: because:\n\nOriginal greater list was [ -1, -2, -1 ].\n\nSo the initial quick_sort( [ -1, -2, -1 ] ) returns [ -2 ] + [ -1, -1 ] \u2192 which is [ -2, -1, -1 ].\n\nWait no:\n\nWait, when processing the [ -1, -2, -1 ] list in the function, pivot is -1.\n\nx is -1 \u2192 equal.\n\nx is -2 \u2192 less.\n\nx is -1 \u2192 equal.\n\nSo, less = [ -2 ], equal = [ -1, -1 ].\n\nSo, quick_sort(less) \u2192 [ -2 ] \u2192 since len(less) is 1.\n\nAnd greater is empty.\n\nThus, the sorted greater for this step is [ ].\n\nSo overall, [ -2 ] + [ -1, -1 ] \u2192 [ -2, -1, -1 ].\n\nWait, but adding the sorted less, equal, and greater:\n\nThe initial step returns less_sorted + equal + greater_sorted.\n\nWhich in that case, is [ -2 ] + [ -1, -1 ] + [] \u2192 [ -2, -1, -1 ].\n\nPutting it all together, the overall array is less_sorted (from [ -6, -8, -10 ]) \u2192 [ -10, -8, -6 ].\n\nThen equal [ -3 ].\n\nThen greater_sorted is [ -2, -1, -1 ].\n\nSo combining them, it's [ -10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, -1 ], which is exactly the expected output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2, 1]\n\nSo the expected output is [ -10, -6, -2, 1, 1, 3, 8 ].\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe first pivot is 3.\n\nNow, for each element:\n\n3 \u2192 equal.\n\n-6 \u2192 less than 3 \u2192 less.\n\n8 \u2192 greater.\n\n-10 \u2192 less.\n\n1 \u2192 less.\n\n-2 \u2192 less.\n\n1 \u2192 less.\n\nSo, less list is [ -6, -10, 1, -2, 1 ]\n\nequal is [3]\n\ngreater is [8]\n\nNow, process less: [ -6, -10, 1, -2, 1 ]\n\nPivot is -6.\n\nSo x is -6: equal.\n\nx = -10: less \u2192 added to less.\n\nx=1: greater \u2192 since 1 >-6 \u2192 adds to greater.\n\nx=-2: greater \u2192 since -2 >-6? Wait no: -2 is greater than -6? Yes. Because -2 is to the right of -6 on the number line.\n\nx=1: same as above.\n\nSo:\n\nIn less, we have: [ -10 ]\n\nequal: [ -6 ]\n\ngreater: [1, -2, 1 ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, when processing the less list elements: for each x in [ -6, -10, 1, -2, 1 ].\n\nx = -6: equal \u2192 added to equal.\n\nx = -10: -10 < -6 \u2192 added to less.\n\nx=1: 1 > -6 \u2192 added to greater.\n\nx=-2: -2 > -6 \u2192 added to greater.\n\nx=1: added to greater.\n\nSo, less is [ -10 ], equal [ -6 ], greater [1, -2, 1 ].\n\nNow, recursively process the less.\n\nProcessing less [ -10 ]: returns [-10] as it's length 1.\n\nProcessing greater [1, -2, 1 ].\n\nPivot is 1.\n\nx=1: equal.\n\nx=-2: less than 1 \u2192 added to less.\n\nx=1: equal.\n\nSo, less becomes [ -2 ], equal [1,1], greater [ ].\n\nThen, quick_sort(less) \u2192 returns [ -2 ].\n\nSo, the sorted greater list is [ -2 ] + [1,1 ] + [] = [ -2, 1, 1 ].\n\nSo, now, the sorted 'less' from this step is [ -10 ] + [ -6 ] + [ -2, 1, 1 ] \u2192 [ -10, -6, -2, 1, 1 ].\n\nThen, the equal in the initial step is [3], and the greater_sorted is [8 ] \u2192 which is just [8 ].\n\nSo, overall, combining: [ -10, -6, -2, 1, 1 ] + [3] + [8 ] \u2192 [ -10, -6, -2, 1, 1, 3, 8 ] \u2192 which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nWhat about the empty list? quick_sort([]) returns [] which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: [5] returns [5].\n\nAnother test case: all elements same, like [2,2,2]. The function would assign all to equal, so it returns [2,2,2].\n\nWhat about a list where all elements are greater than the pivot? For example, [5, 6,7,8]. The first pivot is 5, less is empty, greater is [6,7,8], which will be sorted recursively.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nWhat about when the array is already sorted? Like [1,2,3,4,5]. The first pivot is 1, less is empty, equal is [1], greater is [2,3,4,5], which would be processed correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nSo, I think this approach works.\n\nThus, the code as written should handle all cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the Quick Sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer technique. Quick Sort works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two lists: one with elements less than the pivot and another with elements greater than the pivot. This process is applied recursively to the sub-lists and combined to form the sorted array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case Handling**: If the array is empty or has only one element, it is already sorted, so return it as is.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose the first element of the array as the pivot.\n3. **Partitioning**: Create three lists:\n   - `less`: Elements less than the pivot.\n   - `equal`: Elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `greater`: Elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the Quick Sort algorithm to `less` and `greater` lists.\n5. **Combining Results**: Concatenate the sorted `less` list, `equal` list, and sorted `greater` list to form the final sorted array.\n\nThis approach ensures that all elements are correctly partitioned and sorted, including handling duplicates by placing all equal elements in the `equal` list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    less = []\n    equal = []\n    greater = []\n    for x in arr:\n        if x < pivot:\n            less.append(x)\n        elif x == pivot:\n            equal.append(x)\n        else:\n            greater.append(x)\n    less_sorted = quick_sort(less)\n    greater_sorted = quick_sort(greater)\n    return less_sorted + equal + greater_sorted\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: The function immediately returns arrays with zero or one element as they are trivially sorted.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: The first element is chosen as the pivot to simplify the implementation.\n3. **Partitioning**: The array is iterated through, and each element is placed into `less`, `equal`, or `greater` based on its comparison with the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Both `less` and `greater` sub-arrays are recursively sorted using the same Quick Sort function.\n5. **Combining Results**: The sorted `less` array, followed by the `equal` elements, and then the sorted `greater` array are concatenated to produce the final sorted array.\n\nThis method efficiently sorts the array using the Quick Sort algorithm, ensuring that all elements, including duplicates, are correctly placed. The approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and combine their solutions to achieve the final result.",
