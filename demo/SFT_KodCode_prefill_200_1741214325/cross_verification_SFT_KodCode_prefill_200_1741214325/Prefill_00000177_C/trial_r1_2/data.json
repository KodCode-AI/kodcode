  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement the quick sort algorithm in Python. Hmm, quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm, right? So the basic idea is to pick a pivot element, partition the array around the pivot into elements less than, equal to, or greater than the pivot, and then recursively sort the subarrays.\n\nWait, so the first thing I should think about is the base case. If the array is empty or has one element, I can just return it because it's already sorted. So in code, something like if len(arr) <= 1: return arr.\n\nNext, I need to choose a pivot. Oh, what's a good way to pick the pivot? Well, a common approach is to pick the middle element or the last element. Maybe for simplicity, I'll pick the last element in this case. So pivot = arr[-1].\n\nNow, I need to partition the array into elements <= pivot and > pivot. Let me think about how to do this efficiently. I'll create two lists: left and right. Left will contain all elements <= pivot, and right will contain elements > pivot. So I'll loop through each element in the array, excluding the pivot (since I've already handled that), and append them to left or right accordingly.\n\nWait, but wait: the array includes the pivot, but I have to make sure I don't include the last element again because that's the pivot. So for each num in arr[:-1], if num <= pivot, put it in left, else right. Then add the pivot to left or right? No, the pivot will be in the middle during partitioning. Wait, no. The partitioning in quicksort typically involves rearranging the elements so that everything <= pivot is on the left and everything > is on the right, but in this case, since we might have duplicates, our implementation can split all elements <= pivot into left, pivot is in the middle, and elements > into right. But wait, in our initial approach for the lists, the pivot is actually added only once. Or perhaps, maybe in this approach, the left list includes elements <= pivot, and the right includes elements > pivot. So when we gather everything, it's left + [pivot] + right. Wait no, maybe that's incorrect.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. If I'm processing each element, I can have three sections: elements less than the pivot, equal to the pivot, and greater. So perhaps it's better to split into less, equal, and greater. Because if multiple elements are equal to the pivot, adding all of them in a separate list would be more efficient. So, for each element in arr, excluding the last (which is pivot), if it's less than pivot: add to less, equal: to equal, else: greater. Then the final sorted array would be quicksort(less) + equal + quicksort(greater). Wait, that makes sense. But in this case, the code can be:\n\npivot = arr[-1]\nless = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\nequal = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # since the original array includes the pivot as the last element.\ngreater = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\nThen recursively sort less and greater, and combine as quick_sort(less) + equal + quick_sort(greater).\n\nWait, that might be more efficient, especially when there are multiple duplicates. But easier, perhaps, is to create two lists: left (<=) and right (>) and include the pivot in the left, but then the code will handle duplicates correctly.\n\nWait, no. Because the way I chose the pivot as the last element would cause the code to include it in equal or not? Hmm. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to do it all in one pass. Select the pivot, then loop through the array and split into less than or equal to, and greater than. Oh wait, but I might be missing something here, because the initial array includes the pivot as the last element.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, the code for the function is:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr[:-1]:  # exclude the pivot for now\n        if num <= pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    # Then, the sorted array is quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)\n    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)\n\nDoes that work? Let me test it with some examples.\n\nFor example, the test case [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]. The pivot is 1. So, the numbers before pivot in the array are 3,6,8,10,1,2. Wait no. Wait, the array is [3,6,8,10,1,2,1], so pivot is 1. When we loop through each element except the last, which is 1, so elements are 3,6,8,10,1,2. Each compared to 1.\n\nSo 3,6,8,10 are >1, so they go into right. 1 and 2? Well, 1 is equal to pivot, so to the left. 2 is >1, right.\n\nSo left becomes [3,6,8,10,1,2 with none except 1, 2 is >? Wait no:\n\nWait wait. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the code is: for each num in arr[:-1]:\n    if num <= pivot: add to left else to right.\n\nPivot is 1.\n\nThe elements except last are 3,6,8,10,1,2.\n\nSo:\n\n3 > 1 \u2192 right\n6 > 1 \u2192 right\n8 >1 \u2192 right\n10> 1\u2192 right\n1 == 1 \u2192 left\n2>1\u2192 right\n\nSo left is [1], right is [3,6,8,10,2].\n\nThen recursively sort left is [1], which returns itself. The middle is [1] (the pivot), right is quick sort of [3,6,8,10,2].\n\nThen, for [3,6,8,10,2], the pivot is 2.\n\nLeft would be <2? No, wait, [3,6,8,10] (since the array is [3,6,8,10,2], so arr[:-1] is [3,6,8,10], and pivot is 2.\n\nSo 3>2 \u2192 right. 6>2\u2192 right. 8>2\u2192 right. 10>2\u2192 right. So left is empty, right is [3,6,8,10].\n\nThus quick_sort(left) is empty, middle is [2], and quick_sort(right) is quick sort on [3,6,8,10].\n\nAnd so on. It seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: what about duplicates? For example, [3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2, 1]. Let's see.\n\nPivot is 1. So the other elements: 3, -6, 8, -10,1,-2.\n\nWait, in this case, [3, -6, 8, -10, 1, -2, 1], pivot is 1.\n\nSo in arr[:-1], the elements are 3, -6,8, -10, 1, -2.\n\nComparing each to pivot (1):\n\n3>1\u2192 right\n-6<1\u2192 left\n8>1\u2192 right\n-10<1\u2192 left\n1=1 \u2192 left\n-2 <1\u2192 left.\n\nSo left becomes [-6, -10,1, -2], and right is [3,8].\n\nWait, wait, wait:\n\nWait, let's list each element and where it goes.\n\n3 >1 \u2192 right \u2192 added to right.\n\n-6 <=1 \u2192 added to left.\n\n8>1\u2192 right.\n\n-10 <=1 \u2192 left.\n\n1 <=1 \u2192 left.\n\n-2 <=1\u2192 left.\n\nSo left is [ -6, -10,1, -2 ].\n\nWait, wait, but also, the elements are processed in their order. So in this case, when quick_sort is called on left, which is [ -6, -10, 1, -2 ]. The pivot for this sub-array is -2.\n\nSo are the elements in left correct? Hmm, maybe. But perhaps the code would handle this.\n\nWait, but the code seems to correctly partition the elements, ensuring that in each step, the pivot is placed correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial test case in the problem, the output is correct. So it looks like this approach works.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr[:-1]:\n        if num <= pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)\n\nWait, but in the case where arr is empty, len(arr) is 0, return []. If len(arr) is 1, return the same array.\n\nNow, let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: quick_sort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1])\nSample Output: [1,1,2,3,6,8,10]\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial array: [3,6,8,10,1,2,1]\n\npivot is 1 (last element). Loop through arr[:-1], which is [3,6,8,10,1,2].\n\nFor each:\n\n3>1 \u2192 right\n6>1 \u2192 right\n8>1 \u2192 right\n10>1\u2192 right\n1<=1 \u2192 left\n2>1 \u2192 right\n\nSo left is [1], right is [3,6,8,10,2]\n\nThen, quick_sort(left)= [1], [pivot] is [1], quick_sort(right) becomes [2,3,6,8,10].\n\nSo combining, [1] + [1] + [2,3,6,8,10] \u2192 [1,1,2,3,6,8,10] which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: quick_sort([-3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2, -1])\nOutput should be [-10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, -1]\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nThe original array is [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1,-2,-1]\n\npivot is -1.\n\narr[:-1] is [-3, -6,-8,-10,-1,-2].\n\nFor each element:\n\n-3> -1 \u2192 right.\n\nWait wait: -3 is greater than -1? No: wait, -3 is less than -1, because -3 is to the left on the number line. So num <= pivot.\n\nWait, for each num in [ -3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2 ]:\n\n-3 <= -1 \u2192 added to left.\n\n-6 <=-1 \u2192 left.\n\n-8 <=-1 \u2192 left.\n\n-10 <=-1\u2192 left.\n\n-1 <=-1\u2192 left.\n\n-2<=-1\u2192 left? Yes, because -2 is less than or equal to -1.\n\nSo all elements go into left. So left is [ -3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2 ].\n\nAnd right is empty.\n\nSo in the quick_sort call on left, which is this same array except last element is -1.\n\nWait wait, but wait: the new left is [ -3, -6, -8, -10, -1, -2 ].\n\nSo the next step is to split this.\n\nBut in this case, the pivot is last element of arr, which is -2.\n\nComparing each to pivot:\n\nWait, each element except the last (because in the next call, the pivot is [-2], but wait, in the current call, left is split.\n\nWait, maybe let me see.\n\nSo first call: arr is [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1,-2,-1]. pivot is -1.\n\nleft becomes [ all except pivot, and elements <= pivot. So left is [-3, -6,-8,-10,-1,-2]. Since all of them are <= to -1.\n\nright is empty.\n\nSo the sorted array is quick_sort(left) + [-1] + quick_sort([]) \u2192 quick_sort(left) + [-1].\n\nNow, quick_sort on left: [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1,-2].\n\nAgain, for this array, pivot is -2.\n\nThe elements are [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1] (arr[:-1]).\n\nEach compared to -2:\n\n-3 is greater than -2? -3 is -3 < -2 is true. So -3 is <= pivot: left is [-3, -6, -8, -10, -1]. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, in this call, arr is [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1,-2], pivot is -2.\n\nLooping through each element except last: so [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1].\n\nEach compared to -2.\n\n-3 > -2 \u2192 no. -3 is less than -2? Yes. So added to left.\n\nSimilarly, -6 is less than -2: left.\n\n-8: same.\n\n-10: same.\n\n-1: less than -2? No, wait: is -1 less than or equal to -2? No. Because -1 is greater than -2.\n\nWait, wait: no. Because -1 is (-1) is greater than (-2). So for the array, each element is checked:\n\nfor num in [-3,-6,-8,-10,-1], is num <= pivot (-2)?\n\nYes for -3, -6, -8, -10 \u2192 left.\n\nBut -1: num=-1; -1 <= -2? No. Because -1 is greater than -2. So added to right.\n\nSo left becomes [-3, -6, -8, -10], right becomes [-1].\n\nSo in this step, quick_sort(left) is quicksort of [-3,-6,-8,-10], which when processed, they will be sorted correctly.\n\nThen right is [-1], quicksort called on it returns [-1].\n\nSo overall, the sorted array for left is [ -10, -8, -6, -3 ] + [-2] + [ -1 ] \u2192 [ -10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1 ].\n\nThen the initial array's quick_sort is [ -10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1 ] + [-1] \u2192 [ -10, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, -1 ], which matches the sample.\n\nThis approach works for that case.\n\nAnother test case: [3,-6,8,-10,1,-2,1]. Output should be [-10, -6, -2, 1,1,3,8].\n\nLet's see:\n\npivot is 1.\n\narr[:-1] is [3,-6,8,-10,1,-2].\n\n3>1 \u2192 right.\n\n-6<=1 \u2192 left.\n\n8>1\u2192 right.\n\n-10<=1\u2192 left.\n\n1<=1\u2192 left.\n\n-2<=1\u2192 left.\n\nSo left has [-6,-10,1,-2], right has [3,8].\n\nquicksort(left) would sort the [-6,-10,1,-2].\n\nWhat happens there.\n\nIn that sub-call, pivot is -2.\n\narr is [-6,-10,1,-2]. pivot is -2.\n\nLeft becomes elements <=-2 in the first three elements.\n\nWait, for this sub-call, arr is [-6,-10,1,-2]. So arr[:-1] is [-6,-10,1].\n\nComparing each to pivot (-2):\n\n-6 <=-2 \u2192 left.\n\n-10 <=-2 \u2192 left.\n\n1> -2 \u2192 right.\n\nSo left is [-6, -10], right is [1].\n\nquicksort(left) is quicksort([-6,-10,1]).\n\nWait, wait, no: I'm in the function processing [ -6,-10,1,-2 ]. So when it's being recursively sorted, the function is called with arr=[-6,-10,1,-2]. The pivot is arr[-1] = -2.\n\nSo in the code, left is made by taking elements in arr[:-1] \u2192 [-6, -10, 1]. We compare each to -2.\n\nSo each < -2 is added to left, else right.\n\n-6 <=-2 \u2192 left.\n\n-10 <=-2 \u2192 left.\n\n1 > -2 \u2192 right.\n\nSo left is [-6, -10], right is [1].\n\nSo quick_sort(left) is quick_sort([-6,-10,1]). Wait, no. In this context, when the function is called with left=[-6,-10,1], no. Wait, no. The function is called with left as the split on the current arr.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me see:\n\nquicksort([-6,-10,1,-2]) is the current call.\n\npivot is -2.\n\nSo the left is constructed by:\n\nnum in [-6,-10,1] \u2192 split.\n\nSo [ -6, -10, 1 ] are compared to -2.\n\n-6 <= -2 \u2192 to left. \u2192 -6.\n\n-10 <= -2 \u2192 yes, to left. \u2192 -10.\n\n1 > -2 \u2192 to right. \u2192 1.\n\nSo left = [ -6, -10 ], right = [1 ].\n\nSo the call becomes quick_sort(left) \u2192 quicksort([-6,-10]) + [-2] + quicksort([1]).\n\nNow, for quicksort([-6,-10,1], is that correct? No, because in this call, left=[ -6,-10 ], which is handled correctly.\n\nSo for quick_sort([-6,-10]):\n\npivot is -10.\n\nelements are [-6]. So for num in arr[:-1] (= [-6]).\n\n-6 <=-10? No. Because -6 is greater than -10. So right is [-6], left is empty.\n\nSo quick_sort([ ]) + [-10] + quicksort([-6]) \u2192 [-10, -6].\n\nSo in this step, quick_sort(left) is [-10,-6].\n\nThen, the combined returns to the parent is [-10,-6] + [-2] + [1] \u2192 [-10,-6,-2,1].\n\nSo that's the result for the sub-call.\n\nSo the initial sub-call of left ([-6,-10,1,-2]) returns [-10,-6,-2,1].\n\nThen, the initial right for that sub-call was [ ] as per the previous step? No, no. Wait no: in the sub call processing [3, -6, 8, ...], thinking getting more confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the tests pass, so my code seems to handle cases correctly.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the array contains all the same elements, like [5,5,5]. Let our code handles that.\n\nIn quick_sort([5,5,5]), the initial pivot is 5. Left is [5,5], right is [].\n\nThen quick_sort(left) is called. It's [5,5], with pivot 5. Left becomes [5], and right is empty. So quick_sort([5]) is [5]. So return [5] + [5] + [], which is [5,5]. Wait no.\n\nWait in quick_sort([5,5,5]), pivot is 5. The other elements are [5,5]. So for each, added to left because 5<=5.\n\nThen, quick_sort(left) is quicksort([5,5]), which is again the same process. So when processing [5,5], left is [5], as each is processed.\n\nThus, the quicksort would be [[5], then [5]], then putting [5] + [5] = [5,5]. So [5,5] when added to the original [5] would be [5,5,5]. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach handles duplicates well.\n\nAnother thing: the base case for len(arr) ==2 is correctly handled.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct.\n\nSo implementing this, the function will be:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr[:-1]:  # Exclude the pivot element\n        if num <= pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)\n\nTesting this should pass all the given test cases.\n\nI think that's the correct implementation.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the Quick Sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer technique that sorts an array by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays. The goal is to correctly handle various cases, including arrays with negative numbers and duplicates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Case**: If the array is empty or has a single element, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose the last element of the array as the pivot for simplicity.\n3. **Partitioning**: Split the array into two lists:\n   - `left` for elements less than or equal to the pivot.\n   - `right` for elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the Quick Sort algorithm to the `left` and `right` lists.\n5. **Combining Results**: Combine the sorted `left` list, the pivot element, and the sorted `right` list to form the final sorted array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef quick_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr[:-1]:\n        if num <= pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Base Case Handling**: The function immediately returns if the array has zero or one element since no sorting is needed.\n2. **Pivot Selection**: The pivot is selected as the last element of the array. This choice avoids complexities with other selection methods and simplifies partitioning.\n3. **Partitioning**: The array is divided into two lists based on the pivot. Elements less than or equal to the pivot go into `left`, and elements greater than the pivot go into `right`.\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: The `quick_sort` function is recursively called on `left` and `right`, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n5. **Combining Results**: The results of the recursive calls are combined with the pivot in the middle, ensuring the array is sorted.\n\nThis approach ensures that the array is efficiently sorted using the Quick Sort algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for a wide range of input scenarios.",
