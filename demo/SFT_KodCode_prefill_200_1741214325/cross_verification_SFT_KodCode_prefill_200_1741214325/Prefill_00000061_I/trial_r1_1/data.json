  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that finds the first occurrence of an element in an array which isn't repeated. So, the element should appear exactly once, and we have to return the first such element's value. If there are no such elements, we return -1.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Hmm. The array could be large, so efficiency might be a concern, but since it's not specified how big, I can assume a straightforward method will suffice unless told otherwise.\n\nOne way is to count the occurrences of each element. Once I have the counts, I can iterate through the array again and return the first element whose count is exactly one.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Iterate through the array and count the frequency of each element.\n2. Then, iterate through the array again, checking each element's count.\n3. The first element with a count of 1 is the one we need to return.\n4. If after checking all elements no such element is found, return -1.\n\nSo, how do I count frequencies in Python? I can use a dictionary to keep track. For each element in the array, I'll increment its count in the dictionary.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the array is [2,3,5,5,6,7,2]. The frequencies are 2:2, 3:1,5:2,6:1,7:1. So the first element with count 1 is 3.\n\nAnother test case: [1,1,1,1]. All elements are 1, and they all repeat. So we return -1.\n\nEdge case: empty array? But maybe the function isn't called with that. Or handle it by returning -1. Similarly, single element array: it has count 1, so return that element.\n\nLet me draft the code.\n\nFirst, create the frequency dictionary:\ndef first_unique_element(arr):\n    freq = {}\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in freq:\n            freq[num] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[num] = 1\n\nThen, iterate through the array again:\nfor num in arr:\n    if freq[num] == 1:\n        return num\nreturn -1\n\nThat should work. Let's test this logic with the first example I mentioned.\n\nFor [2,3,5,5,6,7,2]:\nfreq is {2:2,3:1,5:2,6:1,7:1}\nLooping through the array:\nFirst element is 2, which has count 2. So move on.\nSecond element is 3, count 1, return 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3,4,5]. All unique. So return 1.\n\nAnother test case: [1,1,2,2,3]. Here 3 is the first unique. So function should return 3.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait, in [1,1,2,2,3], when we loop through, the first element is 1, count 2, then next 1, same count. Then 2, count 2. Then 2 again, same. Then 3, count 1. So function returns 3 correctly.\n\nBut in an array like [3,2,2,3,4], the first occurrence is 3, but it's count is 2. Then 2 (count 2), then 4 (count 1). So function returns 4 correctly.\n\nWhat about an array where the first element is unique, but followed by others? Like [5,1,1,2,2,3,3]. The first element 5 is unique, so return 5.\n\nYes, this logic should handle that.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration of the array, 5's count is 1, so yes.\n\nI think this approach is solid. So, the code will be as I described.\n\nWait, but what about data types? For example, what if the elements are strings? The code doesn't care because it uses equality, which should handle any hashable type.\n\nAnother thought: How about using a list to track counts? But that's only feasible if the elements are indices, which they aren't necessarily. So a dictionary is better.\n\nWhat's the time complexity? O(n) for creating the frequency dictionary, and O(n) for the second pass, so overall O(n), which is good.\n\nSo I think this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the first occurrence of an element in an array that appears exactly once. If no such element exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves two main steps:\n1. **Count Frequencies**: We first iterate through the array to count the frequency of each element using a dictionary. This helps us keep track of how many times each element appears.\n2. **Identify First Unique Element**: After counting the frequencies, we iterate through the array again. For each element, we check its count in the dictionary. The first element with a count of exactly 1 is our result. If we finish iterating without finding such an element, we return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the elements and then find the first unique element in linear time, making the solution both optimal and straightforward.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef first_unique_element(arr):\n    # Count the frequency of each element\n    frequency = {}\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in frequency:\n            frequency[num] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[num] = 1\n    \n    # Find the first element with frequency 1\n    for num in arr:\n        if frequency[num] == 1:\n            return num\n    return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a dictionary `frequency` where each key is an element from the array, and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that element. This step runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array.\n2. **Finding the First Unique Element**: We then iterate through the array again, checking each element's count in the `frequency` dictionary. The first element with a count of 1 is returned immediately. If no such element is found after checking the entire array, we return -1. This step also runs in O(n) time complexity.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently solve the problem with two linear passes through the array, making it optimal for large arrays as well.",
