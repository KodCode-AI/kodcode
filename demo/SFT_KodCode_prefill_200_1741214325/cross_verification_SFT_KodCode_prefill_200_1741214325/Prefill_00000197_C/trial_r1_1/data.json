  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Fibonacci function using recursion. Hmm, wait, I remember the Fibonacci sequence is where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting from 0 and 1. So fib(0) is 0, fib(1) is 1, fib(2) is 1, fib(3) is 2, and so on.\n\nBut the function needs to handle different cases. Looking at the examples:\n\nfibonacci(0) returns 0. That makes sense for the base case.\nfibonacci(1) returns 1, okay, another base case.\nfibonacci(2) is 1, which is 0+1. So that's the sum of the previous two.\nFor n negative like -5, it returns 0.\n\nSo first, I should probably think about the base cases. Like, if n is 0, return 0. if n is 1 or less than 0, maybe also return 0 or handle negatives.\n\nWait, wait. For negative numbers, the user expects to return 0 as per the test case. So the function should check if n is negative and return 0.\n\nSo first, in the function, I can start by checking if n is less than 0. If yes, return 0.\n\nThen, if n is 0 or 1, return n. Because that's the base case.\n\nOtherwise, for n >1, return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me see: For n=2, it's 1. Which is fib(1) + fib(0) =1+0=1. Yes. For n=5, it's 5. Let me compute fib(5):\n\nfib(0)=0\nfib(1)=1\nfib(2)=fib(1)+fib(0)=1\nfib(3)=fib(2)+fib(1)=2\nfib(4)=fib(3)+fib(2)=3\nfib(5)=fib(4)+fib(3)=5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. In some definitions, the Fibonacci sequence starts with index 1 as 0, 1 as 1. But in this case, the examples show that fibonacci(0) is 0, which fits the standard.\n\nSo the reasoning seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check recursive calls. The function is called with n. So, the structure would be:\n\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n    if n <0: return 0\n    if n == 0 or n ==1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? In that case, the function returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nTesting that with the sample inputs:\n\nfib(0) \u2192 0, correct.\nfib(1) \u21921, correct.\nfib(2) \u21921, correct.\nfib(5) \u21925, correct.\nfib(9): Let's compute. fib(9) is 34?\n\nYes, because the sequence is: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34. So yes, fib(9) is 34.\n\nBut wait, the index here: for n=9, does it return the 10th Fibonacci number which is 34? Let me see, 0 is 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 1, 3 is 2. So n is the index, so fib(9) is the 10th term, which is indeed 34. That makes sense.\n\nWhat about for negative numbers, say, -5. The function returns 0. Which aligns with the test case.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the first version, what about if someone calls n= -1, it returns 0, which is correct.\n\nWhat about n=2, which is the sum of 1+0?\n\nYes, that's 1.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test: fibonacci(-5) should return 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think the code is correct. It's a recursive solution, but perhaps for large n, it's very slow. But given the problem constraints, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem didn't specify any constraints on the input size, but for the examples given, this works.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code checks if n is negative, returns 0. Else, if n is 0 or 1, returns n. Otherwise, recursively calls with n-1 and n-2 and adds them.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following key steps:\n1. **Base Cases Handling**: \n   - If the input `n` is less than 0, return 0 as Fibonacci numbers are not defined for negative indices.\n   - If `n` is 0 or 1, return `n` directly since these are the starting points of the Fibonacci sequence.\n   \n2. **Recursive Case**:\n   - For values of `n` greater than 1, recursively compute the Fibonacci number by summing the results of `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`. This follows the definition of the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Base Cases**: The function first checks if `n` is negative, returning 0 in such cases. For `n` values of 0 or 1, it returns `n` directly as these are the first two Fibonacci numbers.\n- **Recursive Case**: For `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively with `n-1` and `n-2`, summing the results to compute the nth Fibonacci number. This recursive approach ensures that each number is built upon the results of the previous two, adhering to the Fibonacci sequence definition.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem using recursion, though it should be noted that for large values of `n`, the recursive method can be inefficient due to repeated calculations. However, for the given problem constraints, this solution is appropriate.",
