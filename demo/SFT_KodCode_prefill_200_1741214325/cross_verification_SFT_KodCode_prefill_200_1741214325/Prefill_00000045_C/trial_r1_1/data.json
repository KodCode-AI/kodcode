  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a function called duplicate_linked_list that takes a node as input and returns a copy of that linked list. Hmm. I remember that a linked list is made up of nodes where each node points to the next one. So to duplicate it, I need to create a new list where each node has the same value as the original.\n\nWait, how do I start? Well, if the input node is None, meaning the list is empty, then I should just return None. That's straightforward.\n\nBut if the input isn't None, I need to create a new linked list. I think I should traverse the original list and for each node, create a new node with the same value and add it to the new list.\n\nLet me think about how to do this step by step. Let's say I have a pointer called current that starts at the original list's head. Then I create a new head node with the same value as current. Then I move current to current.next and also move the new head to its next.\n\nWait, no. Because if I only have a head variable, I might shift it. Maybe I should have a previous pointer or something. Or perhaps, I can do it this way: I start by checking if the original list is empty. Then, I create a new dummy node to help build the new list. Then, I have a pointer that will create the new nodes.\n\nWait, maybe the dummy node approach is better. Because then I can easily add nodes without having to handle the initial case separately. So here's the plan:\n\n1. Create a dummy node as the start of the new linked list.\n2. Initialize a current pointer to the dummy node.\n3. Then, iterate through each node in the original linked list.\n4. For each node, create a new node with the same value and have current.next point to it.\n5. Move current to the newly created node.\n6. After traversing all nodes, the dummy's next will be the head of the new linked list.\n\nThat makes sense. So the steps would be something like:\n\n- If node is None, return None.\n- Create dummy = ListNode()\n- current = dummy\n- while node is not null:\n   - create new_node with value node.val\n   - current.next = new_node\n   - current = current.next\n   - node = node.next\n- Return dummy.next\n\nYes, that should work. I need to translate this logic into Python code.\n\nWait, but in Python, the function returns a ListNode, right? So let's make sure all edge cases are covered.\n\nTest case 1: When the input is None, the function returns None.\nTest case 2: Create a linked list [1,2,3] and duplicate it. The new list should have the same values.\n\nLet me think about implementing the loop. So inside the function:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if not node:\n        return None\n    dummy = ListNode()\n    current = dummy\n    while node:\n        current.next = ListNode(node.val)\n        current = current.next\n        node = node.next\n    return dummy.next\n\nWait, but wait: if the original node is None, then the function returns None correctly. But wait, according to the first doctest, when we call duplicate_linked_list on None, it should return an empty list. Well, for the list to be empty, the returned value is None, which is correct.\n\nAnother test: if the original list is [1], the new list will have one node with 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about for more nodes?\n\nYes, I think this should handle all cases.\n\nAlternatively, what if the input is None? Let's see. The function first checks 'if not node', returns None. So that's handled.\n\nI think this should work. Let me test it.\n\nFor the sample input [1,2,3], the function will iterate and create new nodes, and dummy.next will point to the new head. So after the loop, dummy.next is the new linked list.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that duplicates a given linked list. The function should take a node as input and return the head node of the duplicated linked list. If the input node is None, the function should return None.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves traversing the original linked list and creating a new linked list with nodes that have the same values. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the input node is None, return None immediately as there is nothing to duplicate.\n2. **Create a dummy node**: This dummy node acts as a placeholder to start the new linked list and helps in easily adding new nodes.\n3. **Traverse the original list**: Use a pointer to iterate through each node of the original linked list.\n4. **Create new nodes**: For each node in the original list, create a new node with the same value and link it to the current pointer in the new list.\n5. **Adjust pointers**: Move the current pointer to the newly created node and continue until all nodes are processed.\n6. **Return the new head**: The new linked list starts from the node next to the dummy node, which is the head of the duplicated list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if not node:\n        return None\n    dummy = ListNode()\n    current = dummy\n    while node:\n        current.next = ListNode(node.val)\n        current = current.next\n        node = node.next\n    return dummy.next\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function starts by checking if the input node is None. If so, it returns None. Otherwise, it initializes aanyl dummy node to simplify the process of building the new linked list. Using a `current` pointer, it traverses each node of the original list, creating a new node with the same value and appending it to the new list. This process continues until all nodes are duplicated. Finally, the function returns the head of the duplicated list, which is the node next to the dummy node.\n\nThis approach efficiently duplicates the linked list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list, as it processes each node exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) as it constructs a new list of the same size as the original.",
