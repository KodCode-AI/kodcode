  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called duplicate_linked_list that takes a node as input and returns a duplicated version of that linked list. Hmm, wait, what does duplicating the linked list mean? Oh right, it means creating a new linked list that is an exact copy, so each node in the original has a corresponding node in the duplicated list with the same value.\n\nSo, the function starts by taking a node parameter. Let me think about the steps involved here. First, I need to handle the case where the input node is None. In that case, I should return None because there's nothing to duplicate.\n\nIf the node is not None, I'll need to create a new head node for the duplicated list. Then, I'll have to traverse the original list, copying each node's value into a new node in the duplicated list.\n\nWait, how do I do that? Let's outline the steps.\n\n1. Check if the input node is None. If yes, return None.\n2. Otherwise, create a new head node with the same value as the input node.\n3. Then, set up a pointer to the current node in the original list and another for the duplicated list.\n4. While the current node in the original list has a next node, create a new node in the duplicated list with the same value, and move the pointers forward.\n5. Once the end is reached, return the new head.\n\nWait, let's see. Another approach could be to build the duplicated list as we go. So, starting with the new head, each time we take the next value from the original list and add it as the next node in the new list.\n\nWait, maybe I can do this more efficiently. For example, I can have two pointers, one for the original list and one for the new list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can be written as:\n\n- Initialize a new_head as None.\n- Then, set a current pointer to the given node.\n- As long as current is not None, create a new node with current's value, and append it to the new_head's end.\n- Finally, return new_head.\n\nBut how to handle the appending part.\n\nWait, maybe I should have a tail pointer that starts at new_head and moves as we add nodes.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nThe function starts by checking if the input node is None. If yes, return None.\n\nElse, create a new_head node with the value of node.val, and then a current pointer for the original list (starting at node.next) and a tail pointer for the new list (starting at new_head).\n\nBut wait, if node is None, the function returns None. So for the first case, code would be something like:\n\nif node is None:\n    return None\n\nnew_head = ListNode(node.val)\ncurrent = node.next\ntail = new_head\n\nThen, loop while current is not None:\n- create a new_node with current.val\n- tail.next = new_node\n- tail = tail.next\n- current = current.next\n\nOnce done, return new_head.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in code:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if not node:\n        return None\n    new_head = ListNode(node.val)\n    tail = new_head\n    current = node.next\n    while current:\n        tail.next = ListNode(current.val)\n        tail = tail.next\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n\nWait, but let me test this logic with some examples. For example, the given test cases:\n\nTest case 1: node is None. Function returns None. Correct as per the first test case.\n\nTest case 2: [1,2,3]. The duplicated list should be the same. So the new_head starts with 1. Then, current is node.next which is 2, then creates node 2, appends, then node.next is 3, so appends 3. Then current becomes None, loop exits. So new_head is a list 1-2-3. Correct.\n\nAnother option, what if the list has only one node?\n\nSo, if node is a single node (say value 5), then new_head is 5, current is None, so loop doesn't run. Correct result.\n\nWhat about if the list is longer, like [1,2,3,4,5], as in the third test case. The code should create a new list with each of these values.\n\nI think this approach should work.\n\nNow, looking back at the sample code provided in the question. It mentions that the function should return the new linked list. Also, the examples expect the same values as the original.\n\nSo, yes, the code I have in mind should correctly duplicate the linked list.\n\nAnother point to consider: memory management. Since each new node is allocated as needed, and we have to build the new list from scratch, I think it's the correct approach.\n\nAnother way to implement this could be using recursion, but for a singly linked list, iterative approach is more efficient.\n\nWait, can this be written recursively? Let's think.\n\nFor a recursive approach:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node):\n    if not node:\n        return None\n    new_node = ListNode(node.val)\n    new_node.next = duplicate_linked_list(node.next)\n    return new_node\n\nWait, yes, that's a much shorter and perhaps cleaner approach. Let me see how that would handle the cases.\n\nIf node is None, returns None.\n\nElse, create a new_node with node.val, and it's next is the result of duplicating the rest of the list.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nComparing the two approaches (iterative vs recursive), both should work. However, for very large linked lists, recursion might hit the recursion stack limit and cause an error. But perhaps since the problem likely expects an iterative solution, or either is acceptable.\n\nWait, looking at the sample inputs, for node being None, the function works. For normal cases, all should be handled correctly.\n\nBetween the two, perhaps the recursive solution is more elegant and easy to write correctly.\n\nBut the code in the problem uses doctests and expects certain outputs.\n\nWait, but in the sample code, the function is written as taking a node, and the duplicates as per the tests. So both approaches would pass the sample cases.\n\nSo perhaps to write the function in code, either approach is acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about the possible constraints: for a very long linked list, a recursive approach may stack overflow. So, perhaps the iterative approach is better.\n\nBut unless the problem expects handling very large lists, either approach is okay.\n\nSo, in the code, I think writing an iterative option would be better for avoiding stack overflow.\n\nSo the code I have in mind is:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if node is None:\n        return None\n    new_head = ListNode(node.val)\n    current = node.next\n    tail = new_head\n    while current is not None:\n        tail.next = ListNode(current.val)\n        tail = tail.next\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nWait, what about when the node is just a single node? Like [5]. Then the code does new_head = 5, current is None, loop doesn't run, returns new_head with 5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: empty list returns None, which is correct.\n\nSo I think this approach is solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a duplicate of a given singly linked list. The goal is to construct a new linked list where each node has the same value as the corresponding node in the original list.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem is to traverse the given linked list and create a new linked list with the same values in the same order. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Handle Edge Case for Empty List**: If the input node is `None`, return `None` immediately as there is nothing to duplicate.\n2. **Initialize the New Linked List**: Create a new head node with the same value as the input node.\n3. **Traverse the Original List**: Use a pointer to traverse the original list starting from the head node.\n4. **Construct the New List**: For each node in the original list, create a new node in the new linked list with the same value and move the pointer to the next node in both the original and new lists.\n5. **Return the New Head**: Once the entire original list has been traversed, return the head of the new linked list.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node from the original list is duplicated exactly once, resulting in a new linked list with identical values and structure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    \"\"\"Duplicates the given linked list.\"\"\"\n    if node is None:\n        return None\n    new_head = ListNode(node.val)\n    tail = new_head\n    current = node.next\n    while current:\n        tail.next = ListNode(current.val)\n        tail = tail.next\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Edge Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input node is `None` and returns `None` if true, handling the case of an empty list.\n- **Initialization**: A new head node is created with the value of the input node. This serves as the starting point of the new linked list.\n- **Traversal and Construction**: Using a while loop, the function traverses each node in the original list. For each node, a new node is created and appended to the new linked list.\n- **Pointers Management**: The `tail` pointer is used to keep track of the last node in the new linked list, allowing efficient appending of new nodes. The `current` pointer moves through each node of the original list.\n\nThis method efficiently duplicates the linked list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the new linked list.",
