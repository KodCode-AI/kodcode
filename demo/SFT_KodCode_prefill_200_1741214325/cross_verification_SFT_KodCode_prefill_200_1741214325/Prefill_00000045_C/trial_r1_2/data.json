  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to write a function called duplicate_linked_list which takes a node as input and returns a new linked list that's a duplicate of the original one. Hmm, the examples show that if the input is None, it returns an empty list, which makes sense. And for a non-empty list, it duplicates it. \n\nWait, the problem seems straightforward, but I should think about how to approach it. Let me consider what a linked list is. It's a series of nodes where each node points to the next one. So to duplicate it, I need to create a new linked list where each new node has the same value as the original, and the structure is identical.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Check if the input node is None. If it is, return None because there's nothing to duplicate.\n2. Otherwise, create a new head node with the same value as the input node.\n3. Then, iterate through the original list, for each node, create a new node in the duplicated list with the same value.\n4. Keep a pointer to the current new node so that I can add the next node to it.\n\nWait, but since the original list can be modified, but I don't think that's allowed. Wait, no, the question says 'duplicate', so the original should remain unchanged. So yes, I have to make a deep copy for each node.\n\nSo for example, if the original node is 1 -> 2 -> 3, then the duplicated should also be 1 -> 2 ->3, but with new nodes.\n\nHow do I structure the function?\n\nMaybe I'll have a current pointer that moves through the original list. At the same time, I'll have a new_current pointer to build the new list.\n\nSo the initial step:\n\nCreate a new_head, and assign its value to the original node's value. Then, the new_current is new_head.\n\nThen, for each subsequent node in the original list:\n\n- Create a new node with the same value.\n- Set new_current's next to point to this new node.\n- Move new_current to this new node.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if node is None:\n        return None\n    # create the new head\n    new_head = ListNode(node.val)\n    new_current = new_head\n    current = node.next\n    while current is not None:\n        new_node = ListNode(current.val)\n        new_current.next = new_node\n        new_current = new_node\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n\nWait, does that cover all cases?\n\nTesting:\n\nTest case 1: node is None. Returns None. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: [1,2,3]. The new list is 1->2->3. Correct.\n\nTest case 3: [1,2,3,4,5]. The new list should have the same. So yes.\n\nOh, but wait, isn't this a shallow copy? No, because each new node is a new object, so even if the original is modified, the new list remains the same.\n\nSo, this should work.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a duplicate of a given linked list. This means that each node in the original linked list should be replicated in a new linked list, maintaining the same structure and values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the input node is `None`, we return `None` immediately as there is nothing to duplicate.\n2. **Create the new head node**: We start by creating the head node of the new linked list with the same value as the original head node.\n3. **Iterate through the original list**: Using a pointer, we traverse each node in the original linked list. For each node, we create a corresponding new node in the duplicated list.\n4. **Link the new nodes**: As we create each new node, we link it to the previous node in the new linked list, ensuring the structure is maintained.\n\nThis approach ensures that we create a deep copy of the original linked list, where each node is a new object with the same value as the original.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    if not node:\n        return None\n    new_head = ListNode(node.val)\n    new_current = new_head\n    current = node.next\n    while current:\n        new_node = ListNode(current.val)\n        new_current.next = new_node\n        new_current = new_node\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the input node is `None`. If so, it returns `None` immediately.\n- **Head Node Creation**: A new head node is created with the same value as the original head node. This serves as the starting point of the duplicated list.\n- **Traversal and Duplication**: Using a loop, each subsequent node in the original list is processed. For each node, a new node is created in the duplicated list, and pointers are adjusted to link these new nodes together.\n- **Final Link**: The loop continues until the end of the original list is reached, ensuring all nodes are duplicated.\n\nThis method efficiently duplicates the linked list with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list, as each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the duplicated nodes.",
