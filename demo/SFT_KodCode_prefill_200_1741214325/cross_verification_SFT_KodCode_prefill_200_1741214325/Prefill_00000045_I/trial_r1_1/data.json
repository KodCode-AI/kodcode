  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to duplicate a linked list. Hmm, so the goal is to create a copy of the original linked list where each node has the same value as the original and the next pointers are also copied accordingly. \n\nLet me think about how a linked list is structured. Each node contains some data and a pointer to the next node. So, duplicating the list means I need to create new nodes with the same data and link them in the same order as the original list.\n\nFirst, I should consider the case when the original linked list is empty. In that case, the function should just return None because there's nothing to duplicate.\n\nAssuming the linked list is not empty, I'll need to traverse the original list and create new nodes one by one. I can start by initializing a new head node for the duplicated list. Then, I'll have a pointer that moves through the original list while another pointer builds the new list.\n\nWait, but in Python, I might not have actual pointers, but I can manipulate the node references accordingly.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Create a new head node for the duplicated list.\n2. Use a current pointer that starts at the head of the original list.\n3. Use another pointer, let's call it new_current, to build the duplicated list step by step.\n4. For each node in the original list:\n   a. Create a new node with the same data as the current node.\n   b. Link new_current to this new node.\n   c. Move current to the next node in the original list.\n   d. Move new_current to the newly created node.\n5. Continue this until the end of the original list is reached.\n\nOkay, but I need to make sure that the original list isn't modified during this process. Since we're creating new nodes, the original list should remain unchanged.\n\nWait, should I handle the case when the original list has only one node? Probably, the same logic applies, so it should be handled automatically.\n\nLet me outline this step by step with an example. Suppose the original list is 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n\n- Start with current at 1, new_current at None.\n- Create a new node with value 1, set new_head to this node, and new_current to this node.\n- Move current to 2.\n- Create a new node with value 2, set new_current.next to it. Now new_current is pointing to 2.\n- Move current to 3.\n- Create a new node with value 3, set new_current.next to it. Now new_current is pointing to 3.\n- Since current.next is None, we stop.\n\nSo the duplicated list becomes 1 -> 2 -> 3, same as the original.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. Now, how do I implement this in Python?\n\nI should define a Node class first. Each Node has a data attribute and a next attribute.\n\nThen, the function duplicate_linked_list will take the head of the original linked list as input.\n\nInside the function:\n\nCheck if head is None. If yes, return None.\n\nOtherwise, initialize new_head as a new Node with data equal to head.data. Then, set new_current to new_head. Then, set current to head.next.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe a better approach is:\n\ncurrent = original_head\nnew_current = new_node\nWhile current is not None:\n    create new_node with current.data\n    new_current.next = new_node\n    new_current = new_node\n    current = current.next\n\nBut how to initialize this properly?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\noriginal_current = head\nnew_head = None\nnew_current = None\n\nThen, in a loop:\n\nif original_current is not None:\n    create a new node with original_current.data\n    if new_head is None:\n        new_head = new_node\n        new_current = new_head\n    else:\n        new_current.next = new_node\n        new_current = new_node\n    original_current = original_current.next\n\nYes, that should work. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, more efficiently:\n\noriginal_current = head\nnew_head = new_current = Node(original_current.data)\n\nThen, original_current moves to the next, and for each node, create a new one and link.\n\nWait, no. The initial step should be:\n\nIf head is None, return None.\n\nElse, create new_head with head's data, new_current = new_head. Then, move original_current to head.next. Then, for each subsequent node, create new nodes and append.\n\nAlternatively, the code would be:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    if not head:\n        return None\n    new_head = Node(head.data)\n    new_current = new_head\n    current = head.next\n    while current:\n        new_node = Node(current.data)\n        new_current.next = new_node\n        new_current = new_node\n        current = current.next\n    return new_head\n\nWait, that seems correct. Because for each node in the original list starting from head, we create a new node in the duplicated list.\n\nWait no, actually, after creating new_head, current is set to head.next, which skips the head in the original list. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Because the head's data is already used to create new_head. Then, the rest of the nodes are from head.next onwards, which is correct. So the loop would handle the rest of the nodes.\n\nWait, let's test this with the example where original list is 1->2->3.\n\n- head is 1. new_head is 1. new_current is 1. current is head.next which is 2.\n\nLoop starts since current is not None.\n\nCreate new node with data 2. new_current (1) next is 2. new_current becomes 2.\n\ncurrent becomes 3.\n\nLoop again: create new node 3. 2's next is 3. new_current becomes 3.\n\ncurrent becomes None. Loop ends.\n\nSo new_head is 1->2->3, correct.\n\nAnother test: original list is one node.\n\n- head is 5. new_head is 5. current is None. loop doesn't run. Return 5.\n\nAnother test: original list is empty. Function returns None.\n\nThis seems solid. So the code is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a duplicate of a given linked list, including both the node values and the structure defined by the next pointers. This means that each node in the original linked list will have a corresponding node in the duplicated list with the same value, and the nodes will be linked in the same order.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves traversing the original linked list and creating a new linked list where each node is a copy of the corresponding node in the original list. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Check for an empty list**: If the original linked list is empty (i.e., the head is `None`), return `None` as there is nothing to copy.\n2. **Initialize the duplicated list**: Create a new head node for the duplicated list using the value of the original head node. This new head will be the starting point of our duplicated list.\n3. **Traverse the original list**: Use a pointer to iterate through each node of the original linked list starting from the head. For each node encountered:\n   - Create a new node with the same value as the current node in the original list.\n   - Link this new node to the end of the duplicated list.\n   - Move the pointer in the original list to the next node and continue the process until the end of the list is reached.\n4. **Return the duplicated list**: Once all nodes have been processed, return the head of the duplicated linked list.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node in the original list is copied exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list. The space complexity is also O(n) as we are creating a new linked list of the same size.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data=None):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    if not head:\n        return None\n    \n    # Initialize the new head with the data of the original head\n    new_head = Node(head.data)\n    new_current = new_head\n    \n    # Traverse the original linked list starting from the second node\n    current = head.next\n    \n    while current:\n        # Create a new node with the same data as current node\n        new_node = Node(current.data)\n        # Link the new node to the new_current's next\n        new_current.next = new_node\n        # Move to the newly created node\n        new_current = new_node\n        # Move to the next node in the original list\n        current = current.next\n    \n    return new_head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Node Class**: This class defines the structure of each node in the linked list, containing `data` and a `next` pointer.\n- **duplicate_linked_list Function**: This function takes the head of the original linked list as input and returns the head of the duplicated linked list.\n  - It first checks if the input head is `None` and returns `None` immediately if so.\n  - It initializes the duplicated list with a new head node having the same data as the original head.\n  - Using a loop, it traverses each node of the original list, creating corresponding nodes in the duplicated list and linking them together.\n  - Finally, it returns the head of the newly created duplicated linked list.\n\nThis solution efficiently duplicates the linked list by maintaining a linear time complexity and ensuring that each node is processed exactly once.",
