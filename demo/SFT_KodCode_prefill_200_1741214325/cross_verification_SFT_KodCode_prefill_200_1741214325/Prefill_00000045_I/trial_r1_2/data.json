  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to duplicate a linked list. Hmm, let me think about how linked lists work. Each node has a value and a next pointer. So, to duplicate the list, I'll need to create a new list where each node has the same value as the original and the next pointers are set to the next new nodes.\n\nWait, so the original linked list is made up of nodes where each node's next points to the next node in the sequence. To duplicate it, I can't just point the new nodes to the original nodes because that wouldn't be a real duplication. I actually need to create new node objects with the same values.\n\nI think I should traverse the original linked list, and for each node, create a new node with the same data. Then, link these new nodes together in the same order.\n\nSo first, I need to start with an empty new linked list. I'll create a head pointer for the new list and probably a tail pointer to keep track of the end of the new list as I build it.\n\nI'll have a current pointer that starts at the head of the original list. For each current node, I'll create a new node with the same value. Then, if the new list is empty, I'll set the head and tail of the new list to this new node. Otherwise, I'll attach this new node to the tail's next and update the tail to this new node. After moving to the next node in the original list, I'll repeat the process until I reach the end, which is when current becomes None.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to structure the loop. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the new head and new tail as None.\n2. Set a current pointer to the original head.\n3. While current is not None:\n   a. Create a new node with current.value.\n   b. If new head is None, set new head and new tail to this new node.\n   c. Else, set new tail's next to new node, then update new tail to this new node.\n   d. Move current to current.next.\n4. After the loop, return the new head.\n\nI should make sure that each new node's next starts as None, except when linking to the next new node. Hmm, yeah, because each time we add a new node, we only set the tail's next once and then move the tail forward.\n\nTesting this logic with a simple example: Suppose the original list is 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n\n- Start with new_head and new_tail as None.\n- Current is 1. Create new node (1). Since new_head is None, set new_head and new_tail to this node.\n- Current becomes 2. Create new node (2). new_tail.next = 2, new_tail becomes 2.\n- Current becomes 3. Create new node (3). new_tail.next = 3, new_tail becomes 3.\n- Current becomes None. Exit loop.\n\nThe new list is 1 -> 2 -> 3, which is correct.\n\nWhat about an empty list? If the original head is None, the function should return None, which the code should handle naturally because the loop doesn't run.\n\nBut wait, in Python, how are the nodes defined? Do I have a Node class? The problem statement just says \"linked list,\" but in Python, it's customary to define a Node with a value and a next attribute.\n\nAssuming I have a Node class like this:\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.next = None\n\nThen, the function would look like this:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    # Initialize new list pointers\n    new_head = None\n    new_tail = None\n\n    # Traverse the original list\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        # Create a new node\n        new_node = Node(current.value)\n\n        # Attach to new list\n        if new_head is None:\n            new_head = new_node\n            new_tail = new_node\n        else:\n            new_tail.next = new_node\n            new_tail = new_tail.next\n\n        # Move to next node in original list\n        current = current.next\n\n    return new_head\n\nThat should do it. Let me think about edge cases. If the original list has only one node, the duplicated list will correctly have one node. If the list is empty, it returns None.\n\nWait, but the original code has a while loop that runs if current is not None. So, if the original list is empty (head is None), current is None, so the loop doesn't run, and new_head remains None, which is correct.\n\nYes, that should handle all cases. I think this should work.\n</think>\n\nTo duplicate a linked list, we need to create a new linked list where each node has the same value as the corresponding node in the original list. This involves creating new nodes and linking them together in the same sequence.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves traversing the original linked list and creating a new node for each node in the original list. We maintain a new head and tail pointer for the duplicated list. As we traverse each node, we add the new node to the end of the new list by updating the tail's next pointer and moving the tail forward. This ensures that each new node is properly linked to the next node in the sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.next = None\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    new_head = None\n    new_tail = None\n    current = head\n\n    while current is not None:\n        new_node = Node(current.value)\n        if new_head is None:\n            new_head = new_node\n            new_tail = new_node\n        else:\n            new_tail.next = new_node\n            new_tail = new_tail.next\n        current = current.next\n\n    return new_head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing pointers for the new head (`new_head`) and new tail (`new_tail`) of the duplicated list, both set to `None`.\n2. **Traversal**: Using a while loop, we traverse each node in the original list (`current`). For each node:\n   - **Create New Node**: A new node (`new_node`) is created with the same value as the current node.\n   - **Link New Node**: If the new list is empty (`new_head` is `None`), both `new_head` and `new_tail` are set to `new_node`. Otherwise, the new node is linked to the tail of the new list, and the tail is moved forward.\n3. **Update Pointers**: After each iteration, the current pointer moves to the next node in the original list until all nodes are processed.\n4. **Return**: The function returns `new_head`, which is the head of the duplicated linked list.\n\nThis approach efficiently duplicates the linked list by iterating through each node exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list.",
