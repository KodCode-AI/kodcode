  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to duplicate a linked list. Hmm, the function should create a new linked list where both the node values and the next pointers are copied. So, I have to make sure that each node in the new list is a separate object from the original, but with the same data and structure.\n\nFirst, I should think about how a linked list is structured. Each node has a value and a next pointer which points to the next node or None if it's the last node. To duplicate this, I need to create a new node for each existing node and link them together in the same order.\n\nWhat about an empty linked list? Well, if the original is None, then the duplicate should also be None. That's an easy case to handle.\n\nIf the original list isn't empty, I'll start by creating a new head node with the same value as the original head. Then, I'll need to iterate through each node in the original list. For each node, I'll create a new node in the duplicate list and set its next pointer appropriately.\n\nWait, but if I create the new nodes one by one and link them, I need to keep track of the current node in the new list so that I can append the next node correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the original linked list is empty. If yes, return None.\n2. Create a new head node with the same value as the original head.\n3. Initialize a current pointer to the new head.\n4. Iterate through each node in the original linked list starting from the head:\n   a. For each node, create a new node with the same value.\n   b. Set the current's next pointer to the new node.\n   c. Move the current pointer to the new node.\n5. Continue until all nodes are processed.\n6. Return the new head.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the function will take the original head as an argument and return the new head.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in Python. Each node is an object, perhaps with a class definition. But since the question doesn't specify the node structure, I'll assume it's a simple Node class with 'val' and 'next' attributes.\n\nLet me write a little helper function or at least have the Node structure in mind. Maybe it's already defined elsewhere, so in this case, I don't need to redefine it.\n\nSo, the function will start:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n\nThen, check if head is None, return None.\n\nelse:\n\n    new_head = Node(head.val)\n    current_new = new_head\n    current_original = head\n\n    while current_original.next is not None:\n        current_original = current_original.next\n        new_node = Node(current_original.val)\n        current_new.next = new_node\n        current_new = new_node\n\nWait, no. Because in the while loop condition, if current_original is not None and current_original.next is not None, we go into the loop.\n\nWait, but initially, current_original is head. So, in the first iteration, current_original.next could be None (if it's a single-node list). So, perhaps I should process the next node each time.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose original list: A -> B -> C -> None.\n\nNew list starts with A.\n\nThen, for each node in original starting from B (since I've already done A), I create a new node and link it.\n\nWait, but in my code above, I have a while loop that starts processing current_original.next, which might be incorrect.\n\nLet me adjust the loop to iterate through all the nodes except the head.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to have current_original start at the original head, and for each node in current_original, create a new node, add it to the new list, then move current_original to the next node.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    if not head:\n        return None\n\n    new_head = Node(head.val)\n    current_new = new_head\n    current_original = head.next  # move to next node\n\n    while current_original is not None:\n        # create new node with current_original's value\n        new_node = Node(current_original.val)\n        current_new.next = new_node\n        current_new = new_node\n        current_original = current_original.next\n\n    return new_head\n\nYes, that seems better. Because after creating the new_head (A in the example), current_original is head.next, which is B. Then, we loop while current_original is not None, create new_node B, link it to new list, then move current_original to C, and so on. Once current_original is None, we stop.\n\nThat way, each node in the original list is replicated in the new list. This should work for lists of any length, including zero.\n\nWait, what about the initial case where head is None? The function returns None, which is correct.\n\nWhat about when the original list has only one node? Then, the loop is not entered, because current_original is head.next which is None. So, the function just returns new_head, which has value of head. Correct.\n\nTesting this logic:\n\nExample 1: original is A -> B -> C\n\n- new_head is A, current_new = A, current_original = B.\n\nLoop runs:\n\n1st iteration:\ncurrent_original is B.\nnew_node = B, current_new.next = B. current_new is now B. current_original becomes C.\n\n2nd iteration:\ncurrent_original is C. new_node = C, current_new.next = C. current_new now C, current_original becomes None.\n\nLoop stops. new list is A -> B -> C. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: original is None -> new list is None.\n\nAnother test: original is A -> None. So new_head is A, current_original is None, so loop doesn't run. new list is A -> None. Correct.\n\nSo I think this should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the function should look like this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that duplicates a given linked list. This involves creating new nodes with the same values as the original nodes and ensuring the structure (next pointers) of the linked list is preserved in the duplicated list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for an Empty List**: If the original linked list is empty (i.e., the head node is None), the function should return None as there is nothing to duplicate.\n2. **Initialize the New List**: Create a new head node with the same value as the original head node. This new head node will be the starting point of the duplicated linked list.\n3. **Iterate Through the Original List**: Use a pointer to traverse each node in the original linked list starting from the second node (head.next). For each node encountered:\n   - Create a new node with the same value as the current node in the original list.\n   - Link this new node to the current last node of the new linked list.\n4. **Return the New Head**: After processing all nodes, return the new head node which points to the start of the duplicated linked list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef duplicate_linked_list(head):\n    if not head:\n        return None\n\n    new_head = Node(head.val)\n    current_new = new_head\n    current_original = head.next\n\n    while current_original:\n        new_node = Node(current_original.val)\n        current_new.next = new_node\n        current_new = new_node\n        current_original = current_original.next\n\n    return new_head\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Node Class**: A simple class to represent each node in the linked list, containing a value and a reference to the next node.\n- **Function `duplicate_linked_list`**:\n  - If the input head is None, the function immediately returns None.\n  - A new head node is created with the same value as the original head.\n  - Two pointers are used: `current_new` to build the new list and `current_original` to traverse the original list.\n  - For each node in the original list, a new node is created and added to the new list. The `current_new` pointer is updated to the newly created node, ensuring the new list is built correctly.\n  - The loop continues until all nodes in the original list are processed, ensuring the entire list is duplicated.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node is processed exactly once, making the function efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original linked list. The space complexity is also O(n) as we are creating a new list of the same size.",
