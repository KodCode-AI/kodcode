  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that checks if a list of integers contains the number 5. If it does, I should return the index of the first occurrence of 5. If not, I'll return -1. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function needs to take a list as input. I'll name it something like nums. Then I need to loop through each element of the list. But wait, Python has a built-in method for lists, index(), which returns the index of the first occurrence of a value. But using that might cause a ValueError if the value isn't present. So maybe I should handle that exception.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop through the list with a for loop, keep track of the index, and check each element. If I find a 5, return the current index immediately. If the loop finishes without finding a 5, then return -1. That sounds straightforward.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each index and value in the list using enumerate.\n2. For each element, check if it's equal to 5.\n3. If yes, return the current index.\n4. If the loop ends without finding 5, return -1.\n\nThis approach seems simple and avoids potential exceptions by checking each element manually. It also ensures that I get the first occurrence because I return as soon as I find the first 5.\n\nWait, another thought: in Python, the 'in' keyword can check if an element exists in a list. So maybe I can first check if 5 is in the list. If it is, then find its index and return it; else, return -1. Using the 'in' keyword might be slightly more efficient because it stops at the first occurrence as well. So using nums.index(5) after checking if 5 is in nums would work, but I have to handle the possibility that 5 isn't present.\n\nAlternatively, combining these ideas, perhaps using a try-except block. Attempt to return the index using nums.index(5), and if a ValueError is raised, return -1. That could be a concise way.\n\nBut which method is better? Let's see. Using a loop with enumerate might be more manual but gives control. The try-except is concise but some people advice against using exceptions for flow control, though in this case, it's acceptable.\n\nLet me think about the efficiency. The in operator and index() both stop at the first occurrence of 5, so they have the same time complexity. So in terms of performance, both approaches are similar.\n\nSo writing it with a loop would be something like:\n\ndef check_for_five(nums):\n    for index, value in enumerate(nums):\n        if value == 5:\n            return index\n    return -1\n\nAlternatively, with try-except:\n\ndef check_for_five(nums):\n    try:\n        return nums.index(5)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n\nThe second version is shorter and more readable. It also leverages built-in functions, which are usually efficient and reliable.\n\nI think using the try-except method is better here because it's concise and leverages Python's built-in capabilities, making the code cleaner and easier to read. But I should make sure that the function handles all cases correctly. For example, if the list is empty, it should return -1, which it does.\n\nSo the function using the try-except block would correctly handle all scenarios. Let me write that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given list of integers contains the number 5. If it does, we will return the index of its first occurrence; otherwise, we will return -1.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem efficiently is to leverage Python's built-in list methods. Specifically, we can use the `index()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value. If the value is not found in the list, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`. We can handle this exception using a try-except block. \n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. **Check for the presence of 5**: Use the `index()` method on the list to find the index of the first occurrence of 5.\n2. **Handle exceptions**: If `index()` raises a `ValueError`, it means 5 is not in the list, so we return -1.\n3. **Return the index**: If 5 is found, the index is returned immediately.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it stops searching as soon as the first occurrence of 5 is found, and it is concise thanks to Python's built-in functionalities.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef check_for_five(nums):\n    try:\n        return nums.index(5)\n    except ValueError:\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe function `check_for_five` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. It attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of the number 5 using `nums.index(5)`. If 5 is found, the index is returned. If 5 is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the except block, and the function returns -1. This method ensures that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand.",
