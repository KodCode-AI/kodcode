  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write an insertion sort function in Python. Hmm, how does insertion sort work again? Oh right, it's similar to how you sort playing cards in your hands. You take one card at a time and insert it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.\n\nSo the function is called insertion_sort and takes a list of integers as input. My goal is to sort this list in ascending order and return the new sorted list.\n\nLet me think about the steps. I'll need to iterate through each element of the array starting from the second element. For each element, I check where it should go in the already sorted part of the array.\n\nWait, right. So the first element is trivially sorted since there's nothing before it. Starting from index 1, for each element, I compare it with the elements before it and shift those elements one position to the right until I find the correct spot to insert the current element.\n\nWait, I should also handle duplicates correctly. But since it's integers, I guess any order for same elements is fine.\n\nHow to implement this? Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each index i starting from 1 to the end of the array.\n2. For each i, take the current element, maybe store it in a temporary variable.\n3. Then, compare this element with the elements before it. Initialize a variable j starting from i-1.\n4. While j >=0 and the current element is less than the element at j, shift the element at j to the right (to j+1 position).\n5. Once the correct position is found (when the loop exits), insert the current element at j+1.\n\nWait, another thought: using a while loop for j makes sense here, right? Because j decreases until the element before is not larger than current.\n\nSo in code terms:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(arr)):\n    current = arr[i]\n    j = i - 1\n    while j >= 0 and current < arr[j]:\n        arr[j+1] = arr[j]\n        j -= 1\n    arr[j+1] = current\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, what about if the array is empty or has only one element? Well, the loop won't run in that case, so it's handled correctly.\n\nTesting with a small example, like [3,2,4,1,5].\n\nFirst iteration i=1, current=2. j=0, check if 2 <3, yes. So arr becomes [2,3,4,1,5]? Wait, no. Because when j=0, we shift arr[0] (3) to position 1. So arr after this step:\n\nAfter i=1:\n\ncurrent is 2, j starts at 0.\n\n3 is shifted to position 1, so arr[1] becomes 3, and arr[0] is now 2? Wait wait, no: during the loop, we're shifting, so let's see:\n\nThe initial array is [3,2,4,1,5].\n\ni=1, current is 2.\n\nWe compare 2 with arr[0], which is 3. Since 2 <3, we shift arr[j] to arr[j+1]. So arr becomes [3,3,4,1,5]. Then j becomes -1, loop ends. Then we set arr[j+1] (which is 0) to current (2), so arr becomes [2,3,4,1,5]. That's correct.\n\nNext i=2, current is 4. j=1. arr[j] is 3, which is less than 4. So we don't shift, so loop exits immediately. Set arr[2] to 4. So no change here.\n\ni=3, current is 1. j starts at 2 (arr[j] =4). Since 1 <4, shift 4 to position 3. Now j=1 (arr[j]=3 >1?), yes. Shift 3 to position 2. j=0 (arr[j]=2 >1), yes. Shift 2 to position 1. Now j=-1, so insert at 0. So array becomes [1,2,3,4,5]. That's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle that correctly.\n\nSo I think the code outline is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when the array is already sorted. Each element is inserted without any shifts.\n\nWhat about when the array is in reverse order? Like [4,3,2,1]. Each element has to be shifted all the way to the front.\n\nFor example:\n\ni=1: 3. j=0, 4>3, so shift. arr becomes [3,4,2,1]. No, wait, that's not right. Wait wait:\n\nWait, let's take [4,3,2,1]. i runs from 1 to 3.\n\ni=1, current is 3.\n\nj=0, arr[0]=4. 3<4 so shift. arr[1] =4, j becomes -1. Then insert 3 at 0.\n\nArray becomes [3,4,2,1].\n\ni=2, current is 2.\n\nj starts at 1, arr[1] is 4. 2<4, so shift to position 2. arr becomes [3,4,4,1]. Now j=0, arr[0]=3 which is greater than 2, so shift. arr[1]=3, then j=-1. Insert 2 at 0. Array becomes [2,3,4,1].\n\ni=3, current is 1.\n\nCompare with j=2, which is 4. Shift to 3. j=2 becomes 4; shift, then j=1 (3) >1, shift. j=0 (2>1), shift. So everything shifts to the right. Finally, insert at position 0. So array is [1,2,3,4].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle various cases.\n\nSo the plan is to loop through each element starting from 1 to end of array. For each element, use a variable j to find the position to insert by comparing and shifting elements to the right until the correct spot is found.\n\nSo now, let's write this into the function.\n\nThe function is given arr as a List[int], so it's mutable.\n\nWe can modify the array as we go. So in each iteration, we make a copy (probably not necessary, but since we have in-place changes, should be fine).\n\nWait, but wait: the function is supposed to return a sorted list. So either we can sort the array in-place and return it, or return a new array.\n\nBut given the function signature, it's returning a new list, so perhaps it's better to make a copy of the input array to avoid modifying it.\n\nWait, in the code, the function receives 'arr: List[int]' and returns 'List[int]'. So if the function sorts the array in place, the original arr is modified, which is not good because in Python list is mutable. So perhaps the function should first make a copy.\n\nSo the correct approach is to create a copy to avoid modifying the original list.\n\nSo inside the function, start with something like:\n\nsorted_arr = arr.copy()\n\nWait, but arr is a list, so yes, we can make a copy.\n\nSo, inside the function:\n\nsorted_arr = arr.copy()\n\nthen proceed to perform insertion sort on sorted_arr, then return it.\n\nSo that the original arr is not modified outside.\n\nYes! That's a good point.\n\nSo integrating that into the code.\n\nNow putting it all together.\n\nThe function will look something like this:\n\ndef insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    sorted_arr = arr.copy()\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_arr)):\n        current = sorted_arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and current < sorted_arr[j]:\n            sorted_arr[j+1] = sorted_arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        sorted_arr[j+1] = current\n    return sorted_arr\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me test this with some examples.\n\nTest 1: arr = [3,2,4,1,5]\n\nAfter copy, sorted_arr is same.\n\ni=1: current=2, j=0.\n\nLoop: sorted_arr[j] is 3. 2<3, so set sorted_arr[1] =3, j becomes -1. Then insert at 0.\n\nsorted_arr is now [2,3,4,1,5].\n\ni=2, current=4. Check j=1 (3 <4, no shift). Insert at 2.\n\nNo change.\n\ni=3, current=1. j=2, which is 4>1: shift to position 3.\n\nsorted_arr becomes [2,3,4,4,5]?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, for current=1, j starts at 2. sorted_arr[j] is 4>1: set sorted_arr[3] =4, j decrements to 1.\n\nsorted_arr[j]=3>1: set sorted_arr[2] =3, j=0.\n\nsorted_arr[j]=2>1: set sorted_arr[1]=2, j=-1.\n\nThen insert 1 at 0.\n\nSo sorted_arr becomes [1,2,3,4,5]. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1].\n\nAfter each step:\n\ni=1: current=4, j=0.\n\nsorted_arr[j]=5>4, so shift to 1: arr becomes [5,5,3,2,1]. Then j=-1, insert at 0. So sorted_arr is [4,5,3,2,1].\n\ni=2: current=3.\n\nj=1, 5>3: shift 5 to 2 (was 3?), then sorted_arr[j+1] becomes 5, current is 3.\n\nWait maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps testing each step step-by-step is taking too long, but assuming the code is correct given initial test cases pass.\n\nWhat about an empty list? The function returns empty list.\n\nWhat about a single element? Returns the same.\n\nWhat about duplicates? Let's say [2,3,2,1].\n\nFirst i=1: current 3. j=0, 2<3, no shift, so nothing changes.\n\ni=2, current=2.\n\nj=1, sorted_arr[j] is 3>2: shift. sorted_arr becomes [2,2,3,1].\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait during i=2, sorted_arr is [2,3,2,1].\n\ncurrent =2, j=1, since i=2.\n\nCompare 2 with 3: 2<3, so shift 3 to position 2.\n\nj becomes 0.\n\nsorted_arr[j] is 2, which is equal to current (2). So loop stops.\n\nInsert 2 at position 1.\n\nSo sorted_arr becomes [2,2,3,1].\n\nThen i=3, current is 1.\n\nj=2, sorted_arr[2]=3>1: shift to 3.\n\nsorted_arr becomes [2,2,3,3].\n\nj=1: 2 <1? No. Or wait, arr[j+1] is 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait let's think through this.\n\nAt i=3, current=1.\n\nj starts at 2.\n\nsorted_arr[j] is 3: 3>1. So shift to j+1=3. Now, j becomes 1.\n\nsorted_arr[j] is 2>1: shift to j+1=2. Now j=0.\n\nsorted_arr[j] is 2>1: shift to j+1=1. j becomes -1.\n\nInsert 1 at 0.\n\nSo sorted_arr becomes [1,2,2,3,3].\n\nWait wait, but the original list was [2,3,2,1], and the correct sorted list is [1,2,2,3].\n\nWait, so why is the final sorted array length 4? Oh right, because in the loop, I think I made a mistake in the test case.\n\nWait, sorry, initial array for this test case is [2,3,2,1], i runs from 1 to 3.\n\ni=3 is the last element.\n\nSo step by step for this test case:\n\nsorted_arr starts as [2,3,2,1].\n\ni=1: current=3.\n\nj=0, 2<3: no shift. Insert current at position 1. So sorted_arr remains [2,3,2,1].\n\nWait, wait no: initial state is [2,3,2,1].\n\ni=1: we have current=sorted_arr[1]=3.\n\nj starts at 0. sorted_arr[j]=2. 3>2, so loop condition (current < sorted_arr[j]) is false. So we exit the loop, and j is 0, so insert at j+1=1. So no change.\n\ni=2: current=2.\n\nj=1: sorted_arr[j]=3>2.\n\nSo shift 3 to position 2. sorted_arr becomes [2,3,3,1]. Decrement j to 0.\n\nCompare 2 with sorted_arr[j=0] which is 2: current is equal, so loop condition (current <) is false. Exit loop. Insert at j+1=1.\n\nWait no: the insert point is j+1.\n\nWait when sorted_arr[j] is 2, and current is 2, which is not less than. So the while loop condition was current < sorted_arr[j], so since 2 is not less than 2, the loop breaks.\n\nSo we insert the current (2) at j+1 =0+1=1.\n\nSo sorted_arr before inserting is [2,3,3,1].\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, during i=2, the initial sorted_arr is [2,3,2,1].\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nj starts at 1.\n\nsorted_arr[j]=3>2, so we set sorted_arr[j+1=2] to 3.\n\nThen j becomes 0.\n\nsorted_arr[j]=2 is equal to current. Loop stops.\n\ninsert 2 at position 1.\n\nSo the array becomes [2,2,3,1].\n\nIs that right? Hmm.\n\nWait, wait the array in the loop step for j:\n\nsorted_arr[j+1] is set to arr[j], then j decreases.\n\nSo let's see:\n\ninitially, j=1. arr[j] is 3>2: set arr[2] = 3. j becomes 0.\n\narr[j] is 2, which is == current: loop ends. arr[j+1] =1, set to current (2). So position 1.\n\nSo the array is now [2,2,3,1].\n\ni=3, current is 1.\n\nj=2: sorted_arr[j]=3>1: shift to pos 3.\n\nj becomes 1: sorted_arr[j]=2>1: shift to pos 2.\n\nj becomes 0: sorted_arr[j]=2>1: shift to pos 1.\n\nj becomes -1: loop ends.\n\nInsert 1 at position 0.\n\nSo array becomes [1,2,2,3].\n\nWhich is the correct sorted list.\n\nSo yes, the code works.\n\nI think that's sufficient. Now, writing the function.\n\nEdge case testing:\n\nEmpty list: returns empty.\n\nOne element: returns same.\n\nAll elements same, like [5,5,5]: returns same.\n\nReverse sorted: as discussed.\n\nSo the code should handle all this.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. Insertion sort works by iterating through each element of the list and inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the list. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\nThe insertion sort algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element, as it is trivially sorted. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.\n2. **Iterate through the list**: For each element, consider it as the current element and compare it with the elements before it in the sorted portion of the list.\n3. **Shift elements**: While the current element is smaller than the element before it, shift the larger element to the right to make space for the current element.\n4. **Insert the element**: Once the correct position is found, insert the current element into that position.\n5. **Termination**: Continue this process until all elements are sorted.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is placed in its correct position incrementally, resulting in a fully sorted list by the end of the iterations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers using the insertion sort algorithm.\n    \n    This algorithm iterates through the list, and for each element, it finds the correct\n    position within the sorted portion of the list and inserts it there. The algorithm\n    keeps growing the sorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted.\n    \n    Args:\n        arr (list of int): The list of integers to sort.\n    \n    Returns:\n        list of int: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sorted_arr = arr.copy()\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_arr)):\n        current = sorted_arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and current < sorted_arr[j]:\n            sorted_arr[j + 1] = sorted_arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        sorted_arr[j + 1] = current\n    return sorted_arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Copy the Input List**: To avoid modifying the original list, we create a copy of the input list.\n2. **Iterate Through Elements**: Starting from the second element (index 1), each element is considered as the current element to be inserted into the sorted portion.\n3. **Find Correct Position**: For each current element, we compare it with elements in the sorted portion (from the end of the sorted portion backwards). Elements larger than the current element are shifted to the right.\n4. **Insert Element**: Once the correct position is found (where the current element is not smaller than the element before it), the current element is inserted into that position.\n5. **Return Sorted List**: After processing all elements, the sorted list is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted in an efficient manner for small datasets and provides a clear, incremental method for sorting elements.",
