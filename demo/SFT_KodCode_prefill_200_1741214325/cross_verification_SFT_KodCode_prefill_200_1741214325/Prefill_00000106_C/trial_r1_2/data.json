  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to write an insertion sort function in Python. Hmm, I remember insertion sort is like how you sort playing cards in your hands. Let me think about how that works.\n\nSo, the idea is that you build up the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position. Each time, you start with the sorted portion and add the next element.\n\nWait, so for each element in the array, starting from the second one, I should find where it belongs in the already sorted part and insert it there. But how do I handle shifting elements to make space?\n\nLet me think about an example. Suppose the array is [5, 2, 4, 3]. The first element is already sorted, so I start with 2. I compare it with 5 and swap if necessary. Since 2 is smaller, it goes before 5. So now the array is [2, 5, 4, 3]. Then I take the next element, which is 4.\n\nI need to insert 4 into the sorted part [2,5]. I compare 4 with 5, see it's smaller, so 4 goes before 5. So the array becomes [2,4,5,3]. Next is 3. I check in the sorted part [2,4,5]. 3 is smaller than 4, so I look left, it's larger than 2, so it goes between 2 and 4. Now the array is sorted correctly.\n\nSo, in code terms, I have an outer loop that starts from index 1 to the end. For each element, I have a variable to hold it, then I compare backwards in the sorted portion until I find the correct spot.\n\nWait, how to handle the insertion? Let's say the current index is i, and current element is key. I'll have a variable j starting at i-1, and I check if arr[j] is greater than key. If so, I shift arr[j] to the next position and decrement j until I find the spot.\n\nOnce I find where to insert, I place the key at j+1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate from the second element (i from 1 to len(arr)).\n\n2. For each element, assign it to key.\n\n3. Initialize j to i-1.\n\n4. While j >= 0 and arr[j] > key, shift arr[j] to the right (arr[j+1] = arr[j]), decrement j.\n\n5. Once the while loop ends, insert the key at arr[j+1].\n\nWait, but when you assign key = arr[i], and then you move the elements, you have to ensure you don't overwrite the key.\n\nYes, so that's why you need a temporary variable to hold it.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe function signature is given as def insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n\nWait, but in Python, if I modify the original list inside the function, the changes will be reflected outside. But perhaps it's better to create a copy to avoid modifying the input list. But the function is supposed to return a sorted list. Maybe it's better to work on a copy. Or, wait, let's see: does the function create a new list or modify the given one?\n\nIn the problem statement, example is not given, but perhaps it's better to create a new list and not modify the input. Or maybe in this case, since it's an in-place sorting algorithm, the function is allowed to modify the input array. Or perhaps the function should return a new sorted list, leaving the input intact.\n\nWait, the function is called with arr as an argument, and returns the sorted list. So perhaps the original list can be modified, but in practice, functions in Python can modify the argument. So maybe to avoid modifying the input, I should create a copy.\n\nHmm, but that's a consideration. Let me think: should we create a copy of the list? Well, in the original code, the sample implementation doesn't do that, because it's a sort function and often, people might expect that the input list is modified. Or maybe not, since in the problem statement's example, the function returns the sorted list.\n\nIn Python, lists are mutable, so modifications in the function will change the original. But for good practice, perhaps we should create a copy first.\n\nSo I should create a copy of the input array before sorting to avoid modifying the original. So in the function, the first line is something like sorted_arr = arr.copy() or list(arr).\n\nWait, arr is of type List[int], so sorted_arr = arr.copy() might not be the correct way. Actually, in Python, [x for x in arr] or arr[:] will also create a copy. So, inside the function, maybe I should work on a copy and return it.\n\nSo, inside the function:\n\nsorted_arr = arr.copy()\n\nBut wait, in Python, for a list, you can do sorted_arr = arr[:] to create a shallow copy. Or use the copy method.\n\nAlternatively, just create a new list by list(arr). But perhaps the easiest way is to create a new list.\n\nSo then, the function will sort the copy and return it, leaving the input array unchanged.\n\nAlternatively, since insertion sort is an in-place algorithm, maybe the function should modify the input. Wait, but the function returns the sorted list. Oh, wait, if the function is allowed to modify the input list, but the return is also returned, that's possible. But in practice, for clarity, it may be better to make a copy.\n\nWell, perhaps whether to make a copy depends on the desired behavior. But in the code, perhaps it's better to create a copy so that the function doesn't have side effects. Let me proceed with making a copy.\n\nSo:\n\ndef insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # create a copy of the input array to avoid modifying the original\n    sorted_arr = list(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_arr)):\n        key = sorted_arr[i]\n        j = i-1\n        while j >= 0 and sorted_arr[j] > key:\n            sorted_arr[j+1] = sorted_arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        sorted_arr[j+1] = key\n    return sorted_arr\n\nWait, let me see. Let's take the example I thought before: [5,2,4,3]\n\nsorted_arr starts as [5,2,4,3]\n\ni=1: key is 2.\n\nj starts at 0.\n\nCheck if 5>2: yes.\n\nsorted_arr[1] =5\n\nj becomes -1.\n\nThen insert key at j+1 which is 0. So sorted_arr[0] = 2.\n\nNow the array is [2,5,4,3].\n\ni=2: key is4.\n\nj=1. Compare 5>4: yes.\n\nsorted_arr[j+1] becomes 5 (j+1 is2: but that may not change. Wait, no.\n\nWait j is 1, j+1 is 2.\n\nsorted_arr[2] was 4. So after shifting, sorted_arr[j+1] becomes sorted_arr[j], which is 5. So [2,5,5,3]?\n\nWait that's not correct. Wait maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait let's step through:\n\ni=2, key=4.\n\nj=1: sorted_arr[j] is5>4.\n\nSo sorted_arr[j+1] becomes 5. So sorted_arr[2] becomes5. Now j is decremented to 0.\n\nCompare sorted_arr[j]=2 <=4. So loop stops. Then key is inserted at j+1=1. So sorted_arr[1]=4. Now the array is [2,4,5,3].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen i=3, key is3.\n\nj=2:5>3. Shift to 3. Now sorted_arr[3] becomes5.\n\nj is 1.\n\nsorted_arr[1] is4>3. Shift to sorted_arr[2] =4.\n\nj becomes 0.\n\nsorted_arr[0]=2 <=3. So insert at j+1=1.\n\nSo sorted_arr[1] is3. So the array becomes [2,3,4,5].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to be working.\n\nWait what happens when the key is larger than all elements in the sorted portion? It should be placed after all, which is what happens.\n\nWhat if the array is empty? Then the loop doesn't run and returns an empty list, which is correct.\n\nWhat about a single element? The function returns it as is.\n\nWhat about a list with two elements that are swapped? It will correctly swap them.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo, in the function, I make a copy of the input array and perform the sorting on the copy, leaving the original array untouched. Then return the sorted copy.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the list can have duplicate elements. But since the code is using '>', duplicates will be handled correctly because equal elements won't trigger the while loop condition, so inserting the new element after existing elements. For example, [5,5,2,2]. The code should sort them correctly as [2,2,5,5].\n\nI think that's handled.\n\nSo the function seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sort a list of integers using the insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm works by building the sorted portion of the list one element at a time, inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iteration Through List**: Start from the second element (index 1) and iterate through the entire list. Each element will be considered as the current element to be inserted into the sorted portion.\n2. **Key Assignment**: For each element, assign it to a temporary variable called `key` to avoid overwriting it as we compare and shift other elements.\n3. **Comparisons and Shifting**: For each element, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion (from the end of the sorted portion towards the start). Shift elements greater than `key` one position to the right to make space for `key`.\n4. **Insertion**: Insert `key` into the correct position once the correct spot is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef insertion_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    This algorithm iterates through the list, and for each element, it finds the correct\n    position within the sorted portion of the list and inserts it there. The algorithm\n    keeps growing the sorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list of int): The list of integers to sort.\n\n    Returns:\n        list of int: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sorted_arr = list(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_arr)):\n        key = sorted_arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and sorted_arr[j] > key:\n            sorted_arr[j + 1] = sorted_arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        sorted_arr[j + 1] = key\n    return sorted_arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Copy the Input List**: The function starts by creating a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list. This loop selects each element to be inserted into the sorted portion.\n3. **Key Handling**: For each selected element (`key`), the inner loop compares `key` with elements in the sorted portion (from the end towards the beginning).\n4. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop shifts elements greater than `key` to the right, creating space for `key`.\n5. **Insertion**: Once the correct position is found, `key` is inserted, and the process continues until the entire list is sorted.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is placed in its correct position within the sorted portion, resulting in a fully sorted list by the end of the iterations. The algorithm efficiently handles each element with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, making it suitable for smaller lists or lists that are nearly sorted.",
