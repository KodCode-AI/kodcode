  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have to write a bubble sort function in Python, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me think about how to approach it. I remember that bubble sort works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. I think the algorithm repeats this until no more swaps are needed, meaning the list is sorted.\n\nSo, the function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list. Let me think about the steps I need to implement.\n\nFirst, I know that bubble sort has nested loops. The outer loop probably runs for each element because, in the worst case, each element needs to be bubbled up to its correct position. The inner loop then compares each pair of adjacent elements.\n\nWait, but maybe the inner loop can be shortened each time because after each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element has already bubbled up to the end of the list. So, for each subsequent pass, I don't need to check the last few elements since they're already in place.\n\nRight, so initially, the length of the array is 'n', and after each pass, the effective length reduces by one because there's no need to check the last 'i' elements after the i-th pass.\n\nI should also keep track of whether any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps occur, the list is already sorted, and I can break out of the loop early, which would optimize the function.\n\nSo, how do I structure this in code? Let's outline it:\n\n- Start with the length of the array as n.\n- Loop over each element (i from 0 to n-1):\n  - Initialize a swapped flag as False for each pass.\n  - For j in range from 0 to n - i - 1:\n    - Compare elements j and j+1.\n    - If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap them.\n    - Set swapped to True.\n  - If after a pass, swapped is still False, break out of the loop early.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, I think I should have a swapped variable inside the inner loop, which gets reset for each outer loop iteration. Because in each outer loop iteration (each pass), we might have some swaps, and if none, we can stop.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's good to have the swapped flag per pass to allow for an early exit when a pass yields no swaps. That would make the code more efficient because if the list is already sorted, it won't keep iterating unnecessarily.\n\nLet me think of a sample list: say [5,4,3,2,1]. First pass would compare each pair, swap them, and by the end, 1 would be at the start. But swapped would be True each time.\n\nWait, first pass: j runs from 0 to 3 (since in each i, j goes up to n - i -1. So for the first pass, i=0, j goes 0-3. So for j=0, 5 and 4: swap. j=1, 5 (now at j=1) and 3: swap. j=2,5 and 2: swap. j=3,5 and 1: swap. So the array becomes [1,4,3,2,5], with i=0.\n\nThen i=1, next pass, j runs 0-1 (since n - i -1 is 4-1-1=2? Wait, maybe I'm getting the inner loop boundary wrong. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the list has 5 elements (n=5). Then in the first outer loop (i=0): inner loop j runs from 0 to 2 (since 5-0-1 =4, wait no. Wait, no, for the first outer loop (i=0), the inner loop should run from j=0 to j < (n-i-1), because each pass moves the largest element to the end, so for i=0, inner loop is j from 0 to n-2, so for j=0 to 3 in n=5. So each time the inner loop is j in range(0, (n-i-1)), since n-i-1 is one less than the end index for j+1.\n\nWait, how? Let's take n=5:\n\nAfter i=0, inner loop j goes from 0 to (5-0-1) =4, but wait, j iterates up to (n-i-1) -1, because j is the left element. Wait, no. Because we're comparing j and j+1. So for j in 0 to n-i-2, because j+1 will be up to n-i-1 -1 +1 = n-i-1 -1 +1 =n-i-1, right. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tripped up.\n\nWait, the inner loop for each i should be for j starting from 0 up to len(arr)-i-1, because after i passes, the last i elements are already in place. So for each j in 0 to (n-i-2), because j+1 will be j+1 <= (n-i-1) - so j can go up to (n-i-1)-1, which is n-i-2.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Perhaps, in code, the inner loop should be for j in range(len(arr) - 1): That's for bubble sort without any optimization.\n\nBut to optimize, we can make the inner loop's upper bound depend on i.\n\nSo, in the inner loop, for each i, j runs from 0 to (len(arr) - i - 2) ? Or perhaps from 0 to (len(arr) - i - 1). Let me try to write a small example.\n\nTake the list [5,4,3,2,1]. len(arr) is 5.\n\ni=0:\n\nwe have to compare 5 and 4 (swap), 4 and 3 (swap), 3 and 2 (swap), 2 and 1 (swap). So j should run from 0 to 3.\n\nWhich is len(arr)-1-0-1 = 5-1-1 =3. So yes, j runs from 0 to 3.\n\ni=1:\n\nNow, the last element (1) is in place. So j should run up to 3-1=2.\n\nSo j from 0 to 2.\n\nSo inner loop: for j in range(0, len(arr) - i - 1 -1 ): Or wait, len(arr)-i-1-1 is len(arr)-i-2. So for each i, the upper limit for j is len(arr)-i-2.\n\nSo, the inner loop would be for j in range(0, len(arr) - i - 1 -1 +1 )? Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as range(0, len(arr)-i-1). Wait, no. When j is the index, and we have to check j and j+1. So the maximum j is the last index where j+1 is less than length, so j must be less than len(arr) -i-1.\n\nWait, len(arr) is 5. i is 0: j can be 0,1,2,3. So the loop should run until j < (5 - 0 -1) =4, but j can't be 4 because j+1 would be 5 which is beyond len, but actually, len(arr)-i-1 is 4-0-1=4 which is beyond the index. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the upper limit wrong.\n\nWait maybe for each i, the inner loop runs up to len(arr) - i -1. So the condition for j is from 0 to len(arr) -i -1.\n\nBut j can't go beyond len(arr)-i-1 -1 because j+1 has to be within the list.\n\nWait, maybe the inner loop should be:\n\nfor j in range(len(arr) - 1 - i): \nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose for each pass i (starting from 0), the largest i elements have bubbled to the end. So there's no need to consider the last i elements in the next pass. So the inner loop needs to run from 0 up to (n-1 -i) - 1 = (n-2 -i). So j ranges from 0 to (n-2 -i). So for i=0, j goes to n-2; i=1, j goes to n-3, etc.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper limit, so to get j up to (n-2 -i), we need to have range(0, (n-1 -i)), because j+1 needs to be up to (n-1 -i).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Python, for example, for j in range(n), j goes up to n-1. So if I want j to go up to (n-2 -i), then the end of the range should be (n-1 -i). Because for loop j in ... will take j up to end-1.\n\nWait, maybe let's test:\n\nSuppose I want j to stop at (n-2 -i). So in the range, I'd have to write j from 0 to (n-1 -i) because the end is exclusive. Wait no, no. Wait wait, for example, if I have j in range(0, 5), j goes up to 4. So to have j go from 0 to 3, the end is 4. Ah, right! So if I have j run up to (n-2 -i), I need to have range(0, (n-1 -i)+1) ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nAfter each pass i, the last i elements are in their correct positions, so for the next pass, I only need to consider the elements before them.\n\nThe inner loop should loop from j=0 to j = (n - i - 2), inclusive, because for each j, j+1 must be < len(arr). So for j in 0 to (n - i - 2), and in Python, the range is up to, but not including the end value. So the end is (n - i -1).\n\nSo the inner loop is:\n\nfor j in range(len(arr) - i - 1):\n\nWait, because for i=0, j runs from 0 to len(arr)-1-1 = len(arr)-2. So j ranges up to len(arr)-2, j and j+1, with j+1 up to len(arr)-1, which is the entire list.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo each time, j starts from 0 and runs up to len(arr) - i -1 -1, which is len(arr)-i-2, but in terms of range, it's written as for j in range(len(arr)-i-1). Because for example, len(arr) is 5, i=0: 5-0-1=4, so j ranges 0-4, but wait, 4 is the upper limit? Wait, no, j in range(n) goes up to n-1. So if len(arr)-i-1 is 4, then j will be 0,1,2,3: because range(4) produces 0,1,2,3.\n\nWait wait, wait no: for j in range(a, b), it includes a but stops before b, so when it's range(0, len(arr) - i -1), it goes up to len(arr) - i -1 -1. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to treat the loop as for j in range(len(arr) - 1 - i) .\n\nLet me test with numbers.\n\nn = len(arr) =5.\n\ni=0: inner loop runs j in 0 to 4-0-1=3 as the upper limit.\n\nBecause range(0,3) gives j=0,1,2,3? Wait no, in Python, range(0,3) is 0,1,2. Wait, so that's only j=0,1,2, which means for 5 elements, we only compare j=0 and 1, j=1 and 2, j=2 and 3, and j=3 and 4. So in this case, the upper limit should be 4, so the inner loop's range is 0 to len(arr) - i -1.\n\nBecause, for i=0: len(arr) - i -1 =5-0-1=4. So j in range(0,4) is 0,1,2,3.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the inner loop is for j in range(len(arr) - i - 1).\n\nSo each iteration of the outer loop is i from 0 to len(arr) - 1, because you have to pass through each element at least once in the worst case.\n\nWait, but sometimes, if the list is sorted after a few passes, the swapped flag allows us to exit early. So the outer loop can be for _ in range(len(arr)): perhaps, but maybe I can loop i from 0 to len(arr)-1.\n\nWait, but how to structure the outer loop.\n\nHmm.\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    swapped = False\n    # inner loop from 0 to len(arr) - i - 1\n    for j in range(len(arr) - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            # swap\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            swapped = True\n    # after each pass, if no swap, exit\n    if not swapped:\n        break\nreturn arr\n\nWait, but wait, for i in range(n): i will go from 0 to n-1.\n\nThen, in each i's loop, inner j runs from 0 to (n-1) - i. Because in the inner loop, it's len(arr)-i-1. As len(arr) is n, j runs up to n-1 -i.\n\nNo, wait len(arr)-i-1 gives up to j= n-1-i. For example, i=0: up to n-1 - 0 =n-1. But for j in range(n-1) would give up to n-2, which is correct. So j from 0 to n-2 for i=0. So in code: for j in range(len(arr) - i -1).\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlso, in each i's iteration, the swapped flag is initialized to False. Then, after each inner loop, if swapped is still False, break out of the outer loop. Because that means no swaps occurred in that entire pass, and the list is sorted.\n\nNow, for the test cases given. Let's take an example: [5,4,3,2,1]\n\nFirst pass (i=0): j runs 0 to 3.\n\nCompare 5>4: swap \u2192 [4,5,3,2,1], swapped=True.\n\nNext j=1:5>3: swap\u2192 [4,3,5,2,1], swapped=True.\n\nj=2:5>2: swap \u2192 [4,3,2,5,1], swapped=True.\n\nj=3:5>1: swap \u2192 [4,3,2,1,5], swapped=True.\n\nNow, since swapped is True, proceed to next i.\n\ni=1: swapped=False.\n\nj runs 0 to len(arr) - i -1 =5-1-1=3, so j 0,1,2,3? No, in code j will go from 0 to len(arr)-i-1, which is 3, so j in range(3) \u2192 0,1,2. But wait, len(arr)-i-1 is 5-1-1=3, but j in range(3) is 0,1,2? Hmm, wait no: len(arr) is 5, i=1. So 5-1-1=3, so for j in range(3), which is 0,1,2. So j runs 0,1,2.\n\nIn this pass:\n\narr is [4,3,2,1,5].\n\nj=0:4>3 \u2192 swap \u2192 [3,4,2,1,5], swapped=True.\n\nj=1:4>2 \u2192 swap \u2192 [3,2,4,1,5], swapped=True.\n\nj=2:4>1 \u2192 swap \u2192 [3,2,1,4,5], swapped=True.\n\nSo after this pass, i increases to 2. swapped was True.\n\nBut wait, len(arr)-i-1 when i=2 is 5-2-1=2. So j will be in range(2): 0 and 1.\n\nAt this point, arr is [3,2,1,4,5].\n\nj=0: 3>2 \u2192 swap \u2192 [2,3,1,4,5], swapped=True.\n\nj=1:3>1 \u2192 swap \u2192 [2,1,3,4,5], swapped=True.\n\nAfter the pass, i=3. len(arr)-3-1=1, so j runs in range(1): j=0.\n\narr is now [2,1,3,4,5].\n\nj=0:2>1 \u2192 swap \u2192 [1,2,3,4,5], swapped=True.\n\nAfter this, swapped is True, so proceed to i=4.\n\ni=4. len(arr)-4-1=0, so inner loop runs j in range(0), which means no loops. So the swapped remains False.\n\nWait, no, in the for j in range(0): it's an empty loop. So swapped is False.\n\nThen, since swapped is False, the algorithm breaks the outer loop.\n\nSo the list is [1,2,3,4,5], which is correct.\n\nSo that's the way the algorithm works. Now, to code it correctly.\n\nAnother test case: [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5]. The expected output is [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,9].\n\nI can trust that the algorithm will handle this by making multiple passes.\n\nWhat about the empty list and single-element list? They just return as they are.\n\nWhat about lists with negative numbers? No problem, the same comparison works because comparing negative numbers in the same way as positives.\n\nNow, considering edge cases. For example, equal elements. Suppose [2,2,2,2], it should return the same.\n\nWhat if the list is already sorted? Then, each pass after the first check if any swaps are made, and since none are needed, swapped remains False, so it breaks after i=0.\n\nAnother thing: in Python, the function is supposed to return the sorted list, not modify it in place? Or does it modify the input list? Wait, in the function, arr is a parameter, and we are modifying it in place. So any changes are made to the original list unless a copy is made. But in Python, since lists are mutable, and no indication is given to return a new list without modifying the input, but looking at the test cases, it's unclear whether the input is expected to be modified. However, according to the test cases, the output is the same as expected when the function is called.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to make a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original. For example, arr = arr.copy() at the beginning of the function.\n\nWait, but looking at the test cases, such as bubble_sort([5,4,3,2,1]) should return [1,2,3,4,5]. So the function is expected to sort the list. The function can either modify the input in place or return a new list. However, the function is written as to modify the input list. But better practice is to not modify the input unless necessary. So perhaps it's better to make a copy at the beginning.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, in the examples, the input is lists like [5], [] etc, but the function is defined as taking a List as an argument and returns the same list, perhaps after sorting. So, perhaps to avoid modifying the input list, the function could create a copy.\n\nSo the first line inside the function could be arr = arr.copy(), but in Python, list.copy() is a method, so arr = arr.copy() may work.\n\nSo perhaps, in code:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    arr = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i -1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\nThis way, the original list is not modified.\n\nTesting that, the test cases should pass.\n\nWait, but let me see an example. Let's say we have a list a = [5,4,3,2,1], then sorted_a = bubble_sort(a). Then a should remain [5,4,3,2,1], and sorted_a is [1,2,3,4,5]. So, making a copy is better.\n\nNow, with this, all test cases should pass.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and this process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is fully sorted.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Create a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list. This is done using the `copy()` method.\n2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate over each element in the list. This loop ensures that each element is moved to its correct position in the worst-case scenario.\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, use an inner loop to compare and swap adjacent elements. The inner loop runs from the start of the list up to the point where elements are already sorted. This reduces the number of comparisons in subsequent passes.\n4. **Swapping and Optimization**: Track if any swaps were made during the inner loop using a boolean flag. If no swaps occur, the list is already sorted, and we can exit the outer loop early to optimize performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The function starts by copying the input list to avoid modifying the original list.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for each element in the list. This ensures that each element has the chance to \"bubble up\" to its correct position.\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates through the list, comparing each element with its next neighbor. If an element is greater than the next one, they are swapped. This process effectively moves the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of each pass.\n4. **Early Exit Optimization**: A boolean flag `swapped` is used to check if any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps occur, the list is already sorted, and the outer loop exits early to save unnecessary iterations.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted efficiently, especially for nearly sorted lists, by reducing the number of comparisons in each subsequent pass.",
