  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called bubble_sort that takes a list of integers and returns the same list but sorted in ascending order. I remember that bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. But let me think through the steps carefully.\n\nFirst, I should consider the base cases. If the input array is empty or has only one element, then it's already sorted, so I just return it as is.\n\nFor an array with more than one element, I need to perform the bubble sort algorithm. I think I should make a copy of the original array to avoid modifying it, but wait, no\u2014since lists are mutable and the function is supposed to return the sorted list, I can modify it directly. Or maybe create a copy so that the original isn't changed. Hmm, I'm not sure. Well, since the examples given don't modify the inputs, maybe the function can sort the list in-place. But I'm not sure if that matters for the problem.\n\nSo, the approach is to have an outer loop that iterates through each element, and an inner loop that compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary.\n\nWait, but the traditional bubble sort has a nested loop where for each pass, the largest element 'bubbles up' to the end. That way, with each pass, the next largest is placed just before it.\n\nSo, the outer loop would run n times, where n is the length of the array. Or maybe n-1 times because in each pass, at least one element is in place.\n\nInside each outer loop, the inner loop runs from the start to the n-2th element because in each pass, the last i elements are already in their correct place. So after each outer iteration, the inner loop's range decreases by one.\n\nSo, for i from 0 to len(arr) - 1:\n    for j from 0 to len(arr) - i - 1:\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n\nWait, let me get that indexing right. Because in each pass i, the ith largest element will be bubbled to position len(arr)-i-1. So in pass i=0 (the first pass), we are placing the largest element at the end. Then in pass i=1, the second largest is placed before the end, etc.\n\nSo for the inner loop, we go from 0 up to len(arr) - i - 2. So the range for j is 0 to len(arr) - i - 2, inclusive?\n\nAlternatively, the inner loop in Python could be written using range(len(arr) - i - 1). Wait, let's see:\n\nFor j in range(len(arr) - 1 - i). Because for each i, the condition is whether j is within the unsorted portion. For the first i (0), we have to check up to the second last element. For the next i (1), up to third last, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should correct the code. The inner loop should run for i in the range of 0 to len(arr)-1, and for each i, j runs from 0 to len(arr)-i-1 -1.\n\nWait, maybe an example would help.\n\nLet's say the array has 5 elements.\n\nFirst pass (i=0):\n- j goes from 0 to 3 (since 5 - 0 -1 =4, but j needs to be up to 3 because j+1 would be 4)\n\nSecond pass (i=1):\n- j goes from 0 to 2 (5-1-1=3? No, 5-1 is 4, 4-1 is 3, so j can be up to 2 because 2+1=3, which is <=3 in this case)\n\nSo the inner loop is for j in range(len(arr) - i - 1). Is that correct? Let me see:\n\nIn the first pass, len(arr) is 5, i=0: range(5-0-1) = range(4), so j goes 0,1,2,3 which is correct.\n\nSecond pass i=1: range(5-1-1)=range(3) \u2192 j=0,1,2: correct because you only need to compare elements up to index 2 (element 3) since the last two elements are already compared in the previous step.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the structure in code will be something like:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the list is already sorted? Then swapping doesn't occur, but the algorithm still runs all the passes, which is inefficient.\n\nI remember that an optimized bubble sort includes a flag to check if any swaps occurred in a pass. If no swaps occurred, the array is already sorted and we can break out early. So implementing that optimization could make the function more efficient.\n\nSo, let's think about adding that. For each pass, set a swapped flag to False. After each inner loop iteration, if a swap occurs, set swapped to True. After the inner loop, if swapped is False, break out of the outer loop.\n\nSo the modified code:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    swapped = False\n    for j in range(n - i - 1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            swapped = True\n    if not swapped:\n        break\n\nThis will optimize the algorithm for already sorted or nearly sorted lists.\n\nBut since the function is supposed to be correct for all given cases, including the ones the user provided, let's see. The sample input includes a sorted array [1,2,3,4,5], which would quickly break after the first pass because no swaps are needed after that.\n\nSo, in the code, I should start with the argument arr, perhaps create a copy to not modify the original. Or wait, in Python, when we pass a list to a function and assign it to a new variable, the new variable refers to the same list. So any changes we make in the function will modify the original list. But in the examples, the function returns the sorted list, so the user expects that.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, the function is called and returns a new list, but in Python, lists are mutable and passed by reference. So if I modify the list in the function, the original will be modified. To prevent that, perhaps I should make a copy of the list inside the function.\n\nLike: make a copy using copied_arr = arr.copy(), then perform the bubble sort on copied_arr.\n\nBut let me think: if I run the function and do not copy, and the function is called on a list, the original will change outside of the function? But in the examples, the function is tested, and I think in the test cases, the function is called as bubble_sort(...) which will return a new array.\n\nWait, no. For example, the first sample, bubble_sort([]) returns [], which is correct. But if I modify the input, then in the function, the original array would be modified.\n\nBut perhaps, in the context of the function, the user expects that the original list is not modified. Normally, in a sorting function, it's considered good practice to not modify the original list. So to make this function not modify the input, I should copy the array inside the function.\n\nYes. So in the function, I'll create a copy of the input array.\n\nSo, the first line should be arr = arr.copy()? Or perhaps arr_sorted = arr.copy(). Let me think. Let's write:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list\n    arr_copy = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr_copy)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr_copy[j] > arr_copy[j+1]:\n                arr_copy[j], arr_copy[j+1] = arr_copy[j+1], arr_copy[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr_copy\n\nWait, but in the case where arr is empty, arr.copy() is also empty, so that's handled.\n\nWhat about a single-element array? Then, len(arr_copy) is 1; the outer loop runs for i in 0, then j runs for range(n-i-1) which is range(1-0-1) \u2192 range(0), so inner loop doesn't run. Then swapped remains False, and the function quickly returns. That's correct.\n\nFor testing, let's consider the sample input [5,4,3,2,1]. The function will perform multiple passes. On each pass, the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.\n\nAnother sample, [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5], after sorting becomes [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,9]. The function should handle that correctly.\n\nAlso, the last sample [2,3,1,3,2] becomes [1,2,2,3,3]. That's correct.\n\nI think this should handle all the cases. So, the function as written should pass all the test cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers in ascending order. Bubble sort is a simple, in-place sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. \n\n### Approach\nThe bubble sort algorithm works by making multiple passes through the list. In each pass, the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the list. \n\n1. **Outer Loop**: This loop runs for each element in the list. In each iteration, it ensures that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position.\n2. **Inner Loop**: This loop handles the comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. It runs from the start of the list to the end of the unsorted portion, which gets shorter with each pass.\n3. **Optimization**: To improve efficiency, a flag is used to check if any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps occur, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm breaks out of the loop early.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr_copy = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr_copy)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr_copy[j] > arr_copy[j + 1]:\n                arr_copy[j], arr_copy[j + 1] = arr_copy[j + 1], arr_copy[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr_copy\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Copy the List**: The function starts by creating a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for each element in the list. The variable `i` keeps track of the current pass.\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each pass, the inner loop runs from the start to the end of the unsorted portion, which decreases with each pass. The variable `j` is used to track the current element being compared.\n4. **Comparison and Swap**: In each iteration of the inner loop, adjacent elements are compared. If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped, and the `swapped` flag is set to `True`.\n5. **Early Termination**: If no swaps are made during a pass, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm breaks out of the loop early to save time.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted efficiently, with the worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list. The use of a flag to check for swaps optimizes the algorithm for already sorted or nearly sorted lists.",
