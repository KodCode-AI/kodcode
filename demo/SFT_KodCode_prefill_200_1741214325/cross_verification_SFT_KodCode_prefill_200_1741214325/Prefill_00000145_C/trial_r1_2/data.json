  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to implement the bubble sort algorithm in Python. I'm a bit rusty on this, so let me think it through.\n\nOkay, bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no swaps are needed, meaning the list is sorted.\n\nLet's outline the steps. The function takes an array and returns the sorted version.\n\nFirst, I need to handle edge cases. If the array is empty or has one element, I just return it. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for the general case. I'll need two loops. The outer loop runs for each element because in each pass, the largest element bubbles up to the end. So, for an array of size n, we need n-1 passes.\n\nWait, actually, the number of passes can be optimized. Because each pass places the next largest element in its correct position. So maybe I can have the outer loop run from 0 to len(arr) - 1, and the inner loop goes up to len(arr) - outer_index - 1. That way, each pass reduces the number of elements being checked.\n\nBut initially, I can start with the basic approach without optimization and see.\n\nSo, in each pass, for each element except the last one in the unsorted portion, compare the current and next elements. If current is larger, swap them.\n\nWait, but in code, how do I do this? Maybe using a for loop for the outer passes.\n\nLet me draft some pseudocode:\n\nn = len(arr)\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Create a flag to check if any swaps occurred\n    swapped = False\n    for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n            # Swap elements\n            arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n            swapped = True\n    if not swapped:\n        break\n\nOh right, using a swapped flag can help terminate early if the list becomes sorted before all passes. That's an optimization.\n\nNow, in Python, the code will modify the list in-place. But since lists are mutable, the function is going to sort the given array. However, the function's examples show that it's returning a new sorted list. Wait, no: looking at the function signature, it takes 'arr' as a parameter and returns a list. So probably, it's better not to modify the original list but instead work on a copy.\n\nWait, right. So in the function, should I make a copy of the input array to avoid modifying it in place? Or is it acceptable? Probably, the function should not modify the original, so I'll make a copy.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nMake a copy of arr, then perform the sorting on the copy, then return it.\n\nWait, let me consider the function definition. The sample inputs show that the function returns the sorted list. So the function can either modify a copy or the original. There's no indication that the input array is not to be modified. But in Python, since lists are mutable, if we modify the input array, it will change outside the function. So for best practice, perhaps create a copy.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr_copy = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr_copy)\n    for i in ... :\n        for j in ... :\n            ... \n    return arr_copy\n\nWait, wait. No, because the .copy() does a shallow copy, which is fine for a list of integers. So yes, that's better.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nMake a copy of the input array.\n\nThen, for i in range(len(arr_copy)).\n\nEach pass i will fix the ith largest element.\n\nWait, perhaps the outer loop can be optimized. Because after each pass, the largest element is bubbled to the end, so the next pass can ignore the last element.\n\nRight, so inner loop runs from j=0 to j < (n - i - 1).\n\nWait, but in the first pass, i=0, so j runs up to n - 1 - 0 -1, which is n-2. The last index is j. So for j, the next element is j+1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nn = len(arr_copy)\nfor i in range(n):\n    swapped = False\n    for j in range(n - i - 1):\n        # compare j and j+1\n        if arr_copy[j] > arr_copy[j+1]:\n            # swap\n            arr_copy[j], arr_copy[j+1] = arr_copy[j+1], arr_copy[j]\n            swapped = True\n    if not swapped:\n        break\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the inner loop runs from j=0 to j < n - i -1. Because for i=0, first pass, j goes up to j < n-1-0-1. Wait, that would be j < n -1 - i -1? Or is it n-i-1 as the limit for j to reach up to (excluding).\n\nLet me think with a small example. Suppose n is 5.\n\nFirst pass: i=0. The inner loop goes j from 0 to (n - i -1 -1)? Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, in the code as written, in the inner for loop, it's range(n - i -1). Because for example, if i is 0 and n is 5, the range is 5-0-1=4, so j will be 0,1,2,3. Because in Python, range includes the start and stops before the end. So j will run from 0 to 3 inclusive, meaning j+1 runs from 1 to 4: which covers all adjacent pairs.\n\nYes. So for each i starting from 0 to len(arr) - 1, the inner loop runs for j from 0 to (n-i-2), but because the range is n-i-1, j in the loop is 0 to (n-i-2), but for j+1 it's up to (n-i-1). So all elements from 0 to n-i-1 are compared. Hmm, no, wait, let's see.\n\nNo. The inner loop is for j in range(n - i - 1): So the number of iterations is n - i -1. So j starts at 0 and goes up to (n - i -2) (because range stop is exclusive).\n\nWait, let's take i=0, n=5.\n\nn - i -1 = 4. So j runs from 0 to 3, inclusive. So j+1 runs up to 4. So that's correct.\n\nIn the first pass, we compare 0 and1, 1 and2, 2 and3, 3 and4.\n\nBut after this pass, the last element will be the largest.\n\nIn the second pass (i=1), j runs up to (5-1-1)=3. So j goes from 0 to 2.\n\nWhich compares 0&1, 1&2, 2&3. But not 3&4, because the last element is already in place.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code also has the swapped flag. After each inner loop pass, if no swaps occurred, the list is already sorted, and we can break out of the outer loop.\n\nThat optimizes the algorithm so that it doesn't perform unnecessary passes.\n\nSo, now the code:\n\nBut let's think about how to handle the copying.\n\nIn the function, do I create a copy of arr, then process it.\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are passed by reference. So when I assign arr_copy = arr.copy(), any changes to arr_copy won't affect the original arr. Then, the function can return arr_copy.\n\nBut wait, looking at the sample inputs:\n\nWhen the input is [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5], the output is sorted.\n\nSo, the function correctly returns the sorted array.\n\nPotential errors: what about if the list is already sorted? Well, with the swapped flag, the code will break early.\n\nTesting the sample [1,2,3,4,5]: first pass, no swaps, so it breaks and returns immediately.\n\nAnother test case: [5], returns [5].\n\nAnother test case: [], returns [].\n\nGreat.\n\nNow, let me write the code:\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr_copy = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr_copy)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr_copy[j] > arr_copy[j + 1]:\n                # Swap elements\n                arr_copy[j], arr_copy[j + 1] = arr_copy[j + 1], arr_copy[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr_copy\n\nWait, but in the sample where arr is [5], the code won't enter any inner loops because for i in range(1): j will run 0 times (n-i-1 = 1-0-1=0, so no iterations. So nothing happens, and the function correctly returns [5].\n\nAnother test: [5,4,3,2,1]. The first pass (i=0) will swap each pair, resulting in [1,2,3,4,5]. The swapped flag will be True. Then, starting i=1, the inner loop runs j from 0 to 2. But since the list is already sorted, no swaps, swapped remains False, so we break out. So the function returns correctly.\n\nWait, no. After the first pass i=0, the array becomes sorted, but it takes another pass for i=1 to check j up to n-i-1=5-1-1=3: range(3) is 0,1,2. So j=0,1,2.\n\nBut in the first pass, i=0: the swapped is True because many swaps are done.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait first pass, i=0, n=5.\n\nj runs 0,1,2,3:\n\nCompare 5 and4: swap -> 4,5, ...\n\nThen 5 and3: swap. Until the array flips.\n\nYes.\n\nThen i=1, j runs up to 3, for j=0,1,2.\n\nWithin the inner loop, after the first i iteration, no swaps occur when i=1 because the array is sorted. So swapped remains False, leading to breaking out of the loop.\n\nSo yes, the code will return correctly.\n\nSo the code should handle all test cases.\n\nLooking back at the sample:\n\nbubble_sort([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]).\n\nLet me step through the code a little.\n\nBut I think the code is correct.\n\nHence, this should be the implementation.\n</think>\n\nTo implement the bubble sort algorithm, we follow a step-by-step approach that ensures each element in the list is compared and swapped with its adjacent element if it is in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the input list is empty or contains a single element, return it as it is already sorted.\n2. **Copy the Input List**: To avoid modifying the original list, create a copy of the input list.\n3. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:\n    - Use an outer loop that runs for each element in the list. Each pass of this loop places the next largest element in its correct position.\n    - Within each pass, use an inner loop to compare adjacent elements. If an element is greater than its next element, swap them.\n    - Maintain a flag to check if any swaps occurred during the pass. If no swaps occur, the list is sorted, and we can terminate early.\n4. **Return the Sorted List**: After completing the sorting process, return the sorted list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef bubble_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    arr_copy = arr.copy()\n    n = len(arr_copy)\n    for i in range(n):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n - i - 1):\n            if arr_copy[j] > arr_copy[j + 1]:\n                arr_copy[j], arr_copy[j + 1] = arr_copy[j + 1], arr_copy[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr_copy\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Edge Cases**: The function immediately handles cases where the list is empty or has a single element by returning a copy of the input list.\n2. **Copy Creation**: A shallow copy of the input list is created to preserve the original list and work on the copy.\n3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates for each element in the list. Each iteration ensures that the largest unsorted element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end of the list.\n4. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs from the start of the list to the end of the unsorted portion. It compares each element with its next element, swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n5. **Swap Flag**: A flag is used to track if any swaps occurred during a pass. If no swaps occur, the list is sorted, and the outer loop exits early to optimize performance.\n6. **Return Sorted List**: After sorting is complete, the modified copy of the list is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is sorted efficiently with minimal unnecessary comparisons, leveraging early termination when the list becomes sorted before completing all passes.",
