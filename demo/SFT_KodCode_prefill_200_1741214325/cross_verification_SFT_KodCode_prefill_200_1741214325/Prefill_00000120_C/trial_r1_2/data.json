  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called merge_and_sum_dictionaries that takes two dictionaries as arguments. The goal is to merge them in such a way that if a key exists in both, their values are summed. And if a key is only in the second dictionary, it should be added as is to the result.\n\nHmm, so first, I should probably start by creating a new dictionary that will hold the merged result. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can loop through the key-value pairs of the first dictionary and add each key and its value to the result. Then, I loop through the second dictionary and check if the key is already in the result. If it is, I add the value to the existing value. If not, I set it in the result with its value.\n\nWait, but how about the order? Oh right, in Python versions before 3.7, dictionaries didn't maintain insertion order, but regardless, the problem doesn't specify order, so it shouldn't matter.\n\nSo I'll create an empty dictionary called merged_dict. Then, for each key in dict1, I add it to merged_dict with its corresponding value.\n\nThen, for each key in dict2, I'll check: if the key is already in merged_dict, I sum the value in dict2 with the current value in merged_dict. Otherwise, I set it as the value since there's no such key yet.\n\nWait, but what about if a key is in dict2 but not in dict1? Like, suppose dict1 has a key 'a' and dict2 has 'b'. So after processing dict1, merged_dict has 'a'. Then processing dict2, 'b' is not in merged_dict, so set it, correct.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps step by step.\n\nStep 1: Create an empty merged_dict.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each key-value pair in dict1.\n\nFor each key in dict1:\n    add the key to merged_dict with the value from dict1.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to create a common set of keys by combining both dictionaries. Then, for each key in this set, compute the sum.\n\nBecause, for example, if a key is in dict2 but not in dict1, we need to include it with the value from dict2.\n\nSo, perhaps the process should be:\n\n- Create a common set of keys, which is the union of keys from dict1 and dict2.\n\nFor each key in this set:\n\n- If key is in dict1 and dict2, sum the values.\n\n- Else if key is only in dict1, add dict1's value.\n\n- Else, add dict2's value.\n\nThat sounds efficient, and maybe that's the way to go.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize merged_dict as empty.\n\nLoop through all unique keys that are present in either dict1 or dict2.\n\nFor a key in all_keys:\n\nvalue will be 0\nif key in dict1: add its value\nif key in dict2: add its value\n\nthen, set merged_dict[key] = this total.\n\nYes, that's another approach.\n\nWhich approach is better? Both should work, but using a common set might be cleaner.\n\nSo, let's code that.\n\nSo, first, get all keys by combining dict1 and dict2's keys. So keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n\nThen, for each key in keys:\n\nsum of dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0), right? Because if one of them doesn't have the key, get returns 0, so adding them is the same as summing their present values.\n\nWait! That would be the case when both dictionaries have the key, or only one. Because if the key is only in dict1, dict1 has the key, so get(key,0) returns the value, and dict2.get(key,0) returns 0, so sum is correct.\n\nSimilarly if only dict2 has the key.\n\nExactly. So that's a neat way to handle it.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nmerged_dict = {}\nfor key in set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys()):\n    merged_dict[key] = dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0)\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me test it with sample data.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c':4}\n\nExpected output would be {'a':1, 'b':5, 'c':4}.\n\nYes, because:\n\nFor keys a, b, c.\n\nFor a: dict1.get(a, 0) is 1, dict2.get is 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor b: 2 +3 \u21925.\n\nFor c: 0+4 \u21924.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: dict1 has no keys, dict2 has some.\n\ndict1 = {}, dict2 = {'x': 5}\n\nResult is {'x':5}.\n\nAnother test: key exists only in dict1, does the code still include it? Because in the keys set, yes, as keys are from both dicts.\n\nSo yes, the code correctly sums.\n\nSo, that single loop using get is sufficient.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef merge_and_sum_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = {}\n    for key in set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys()):\n        merged_dict[key] = dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0)\n    return merged_dict\n\nWait, but using a set is one way. Another approach is to iterate through all keys in both, like: for key in dict1: add to merged, then for key in dict2: add, but handling duplicates.\n\nBut using the set approach is cleaner, as it avoids checking for existence multiple times.\n\nSo, this should handle all cases correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to merge two dictionaries into one. If a key exists in both dictionaries, the values should be summed. If a key exists in only one of the dictionaries, its value should be added to the resulting dictionary as is.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Create an empty result dictionary**: This will store the merged result.\n2. **Identify all unique keys**: Use the union of keys from both dictionaries to ensure every key from both dictionaries is considered.\n3. **Sum values for each key**: For each key in the union of keys, sum the values from both dictionaries. If a key is not present in one of the dictionaries, its value is treated as zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that:\n- All keys from both input dictionaries are included in the result.\n- Values for common keys are summed correctly.\n- Keys unique to each dictionary are added with their respective values.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef merge_and_sum_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = {}\n    all_keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n    for key in all_keys:\n        merged_dict[key] = dict1.get(key, 0) + dict2.get(key, 0)\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Creating the Result Dictionary**: An empty dictionary `merged_dict` is initialized to hold the result.\n2. **Identifying All Keys**: The union of keys from both `dict1` and `dict2` is computed using `set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())`, ensuring every unique key from both dictionaries is considered.\n3. **Summing Values**: For each key in the computed set of all keys:\n   - The value from `dict1` is retrieved using `dict1.get(key, 0)`, which returns 0 if `key` is not present in `dict1`.\n   - The value from `dict2` is retrieved similarly using `dict2.get(key, 0)`.\n   - The sum of these two values is stored in `merged_dict` under the respective key.\n\nThis method efficiently merges and sums the values of the two dictionaries, ensuring all keys and their correct summed values are included in the result.",
