  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called merge_and_sum_dictionaries that takes two dictionaries as arguments, dict1 and dict2. The goal is to merge them together, but if the same key exists in both, I have to sum their values. Additionally, if a key doesn't exist in the first dictionary but is in the second, it should be added to the result.\n\nHmm, where do I start? Well, I'll probably need to create a new dictionary to hold the merged result. Then, I should go through each key in both dict1 and dict2 and update the result accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do I handle all the keys? Maybe I can loop through all the keys in both dictionaries. Another approach is to copy all the items from one dictionary into the result, and then go through the second dictionary and update the result's values based on whether the keys exist.\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can create a new empty dictionary. Then, add all the key-value pairs from dict1 into it. After that, I'll iterate over each key in dict2. For each key in dict2, if the key is already in the new dictionary, I add the value from dict2 to the existing value. If it's not, I just add the key-value pair from dict2.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary, result.\n2. Copy all key-value pairs from dict1 into result. Or maybe iterate through each key in dict1 and add them.\n3. Then, iterate through each key-value pair in dict2.\n4. For each key in dict2:\n   a. If the key is already in result, add the value to the existing value.\n   b. Else, add the key-value pair to result.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, how do I implement this in Python? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, create the result as an empty dict. Or maybe it's better to start by copying dict1 into result. Like, result = dict1.copy() ? Because that will cover all key-value pairs from dict1. Then, iterate over dict2's items.\n\nWait, in Python, if you do result = dict1.copy(), that's a shallow copy which is fine here because we're only dealing with dictionaries with presumably immutable values. Or perhaps better to create a new dict by using get methods.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to create a new dictionary, and for each key in dict1, add it to the result. But no, using copy should be more efficient and simpler.\n\nSo, code:\n\nresult = {}\nfor key, value in dict1.items():\n    result[key] = value\n\nOr, more simply, result = dict1.copy()\n\nThen, for each key in dict2:\n\nfor key, value in dict2.items():\n    if key in result:\n        result[key] += value\n    else:\n        result[key] = value\n\nYes, that should handle both cases. Because for keys already present, sum; for new keys, just add.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndef merge_and_sum_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    result = dict1.copy()\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        if key in result:\n            result[key] += value\n        else:\n            result[key] = value\n    return result\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me test this logic with an example.\n\nSuppose dict1 is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, and dict2 is {'a': 3, 'c': 4}.\n\nAfter copying dict1, result is {'a':1, 'b':2}.\n\nThen, processing dict2: 'a' is present, so add 3 to 1, making 'a' 4. Then 'c' is not present, add with 4. So final result is {'a':4, 'b':2, 'c':4}.\n\nYes, correct. Another test case: if a key exists in both, like 'a', the sum is correct. If key exists in one only, it's added.\n\nWhat if the same key is in one of the dictionaries but not the other? For example, dict1 has 'd':5, dict2 has nothing. Then the result will have 'd':5 from dict1. Because the code only processes dict2's items after adding dict1. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that in the case of same key, sum; else, from the second take the value and add. So what if a key exists only in the first dict?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"If the same key exists in both, sums their values. If not, from the second dictionary, the value should be added to the result.\"\n\nWait, wait. So for keys present only in the second, add them. What about keys present only in the first? For example, a key in dict1 but not in dict2. Then, the problem says, the value should just be retained as is, because the only the second dictionary's values are added when the key is not present.\n\nSo, our code correctly handles that, because when we copy dict1 into the result, those keys are present. Then, during the iteration of dict2, those keys not in dict2 are not altered. So the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: dict1 has 'x':10, dict2 has nothing for 'x'. Then the result will have 'x':10. Which is correct.\n\nYes, I think the code handles all cases.\n\nSo, the function is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to merge two dictionaries such that if a key exists in both dictionaries, their values are summed. If a key exists only in one of the dictionaries, it is added to the result as is.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n1. **Initialize an empty result dictionary**: This will hold the merged result.\n2. **Copy all key-value pairs from the first dictionary to the result**: This ensures that all keys from the first dictionary are present in the result.\n3. **Iterate through the key-value pairs of the second dictionary**: For each key:\n   - If the key already exists in the result, sum the value from the second dictionary with the existing value in the result.\n   - If the key does not exist in the result, add the key-value pair from the second dictionary to the result.\n\nThis method ensures that all keys from both dictionaries are processed correctly, including summing values for overlapping keys and adding new keys from the second dictionary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef merge_and_sum_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    result = dict1.copy()\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        if key in result:\n            result[key] += value\n        else:\n            result[key] = value\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The result dictionary is initialized as a copy of `dict1` using `dict1.copy()`, which includes all key-value pairs from `dict1`.\n2. **Iteration through `dict2`**: For each key-value pair in `dict2`, the code checks if the key already exists in the result:\n   - If the key exists, the value from `dict2` is added to the existing value in the result.\n   - If the key does not exist, the key-value pair from `dict2` is added to the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible cases, ensuring that the merged dictionary contains the correct summed or added values. The solution is both time-efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for general use cases involving dictionary merges with value summation.",
