  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that iterates over a list and prints each number. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll start by defining a function. I should give it a name that's clear, maybe something like print_numbers. The function will take one parameter, which is the list of numbers. So the function definition would be def print_numbers(number_list):.\n\nNext, I need to loop through each element in the list. I can use a for loop for this. So inside the function, I'll write for number in number_list:.\n\nInside the loop, I want to print each number. Using print(number) should handle that.\n\nWait, should I add a newline after each number or print them all in one line? The problem just says to print each number, so I'll assume each should be on a new line. That's the default behavior of print(), so it should be fine.\n\nLet me put it all together. The function will look like:\n\ndef print_numbers(number_list):\n    for number in number_list:\n        print(number)\n\nTo test it, I'll create a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and call print_numbers with this list. It should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each on a new line.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The code seems straightforward and meets the requirements of iterating and printing each number.\n</think>\n\nTo create a function that iterates over a list and prints each number in Python, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function:** Start by defining a function named `print_numbers` that takes one parameter, `number_list`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the List:** Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the `number_list`.\n\n3. **Print Each Number:** Inside the loop, use the `print()` function to print each number.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(number_list):\n    for number in number_list:\n        print(number)\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint_numbers(numbers)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `print_numbers` takes a list as input.\n- It iterates through each element in the list using a `for` loop.\n- Each element (number) is printed on a new line due to the default behavior of the `print()` function in Python.\n\nYou can test this function by providing any list of numbers, and it will print each number sequentially.",
