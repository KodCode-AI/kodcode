  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that multiplies a number by 3 and returns the result. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should define a function. The function should take one parameter, which is the number to be multiplied. Let's name the function something simple like multiply_by_three.\n\nInside the function, the task is straightforward: take the input number, multiply it by 3, and then return that value. So the calculation would be 3 times the input parameter.\n\nI should also consider what data type the input is. Since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume it's a number, so the function should handle both integers and floats without any issues.\n\nWait, should I handle any exceptions? Well, the question doesn't mention error handling, so I'll keep it simple. If someone passes a non-numeric type, it might throw an error, but that's beyond the current scope.\n\nTo put this together, the function will be concise. The function definition will have one parameter, then a return statement that multiplies that parameter by 3.\n\nLet me also think of an example. For instance, if I input 5, the function should return 15. Testing this with a few numbers can help ensure it works correctly.\n\nSo I'll draft the function as follows: define multiply_by_three with a parameter, then return param * 3. That should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a single number as input, multiplies it by 3, and returns the result. This is a straightforward task that involves basic arithmetic operations and function definition in Python.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires a function that takes a single numerical input (an integer or a float) and returns its product when multiplied by 3. There are no additional constraints or error handling requirements specified, so we can assume valid numerical inputs.\n2. **Function Design**: We will define a function named `multiply_by_three` that accepts one parameter. Inside the function, we will perform the multiplication operation and return the result.\n3. **Efficiency**: The multiplication operation is an O(1) time complexity operation, making this function very efficient with constant time performance regardless of the input size.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_three(n):\n    return n * 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `multiply_by_three` is defined to take a single parameter `n`, which is the number to be multiplied by 3.\n- **Multiplication Operation**: Inside the function, the expression `n * 3` computes the product of the input number and 3.\n- **Return Statement**: The computed result is returned as the output of the function.\n\nThis function works correctly for both integers and floating-point numbers. For example, calling `multiply_by_three(5)` will return 15, and `multiply_by_three(2.5)` will return 7.5. The function is concise and efficient, meeting the problem requirements effectively.",
