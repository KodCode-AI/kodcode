  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that multiplies a number by 3 and returns the result. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should take one parameter, which is the number to be multiplied. I'll name it something like 'num' for clarity.\n\nNext, inside the function, I need to perform the multiplication. So I'll take num and multiply it by 3. That part seems straightforward.\n\nThen, I have to return the result of this multiplication. So I'll use the return statement followed by num * 3.\n\nWait, are there any edge cases I should consider? Like if the input is not a number, but that's probably beyond the scope of this task. The question seems to focus on the basic functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll define a function with def multiply_by_three(num):, then inside, return num * 3.\n\nI should also test the function with a couple of examples to make sure it works. For instance, multiply_by_three(2) should return 6, and multiply_by_three(4.5) should return 13.5. This will confirm that both integers and floats are handled correctly.\n\nI think that's all. The function looks simple enough, but I should write it correctly to ensure there are no syntax errors.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function in Python that takes a single number as input, multiplies it by 3, and returns the result. This task is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic operations and function definition in Python.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solving this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `multiply_by_three` that accepts one parameter, `num`.\n2. **Perform Multiplication**: Inside the function, multiply the input number `num` by 3.\n3. **Return the Result**: Use the `return` statement to return the result of the multiplication.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is simple, efficient, and handles both integer and floating-point inputs correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_three(num):\n    return num * 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `multiply_by_three` is defined with one parameter `num`, which represents the number to be multiplied by 3.\n- **Multiplication Operation**: Inside the function, the expression `num * 3` performs the multiplication of the input number by 3.\n- **Return Statement**: The result of the multiplication is returned using the `return` statement.\n\nThis function is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) since it involves a single arithmetic operation. It is also concise and clear, making it easy to understand and use.",
