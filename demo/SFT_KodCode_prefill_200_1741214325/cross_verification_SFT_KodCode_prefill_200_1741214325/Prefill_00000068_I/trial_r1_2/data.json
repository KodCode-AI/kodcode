  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function for the quick sort algorithm and then explain each line of the code. I'm a bit new to sorting algorithms, so I'll have to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around that pivot. The elements smaller than the pivot go to one side, and the larger ones go to the other side. Then, the process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the function. It should take an array as input and return the sorted array. So the function signature will probably be something like def quick_sort(arr):.\n\nNow, the base case: if the array is empty or has one element, it's already sorted. So I'll start with if len(arr) <= 1: return arr.\n\nNext, I need to choose a pivot. Sometimes the middle element is chosen to avoid worst-case scenarios, but for simplicity, maybe I'll take the last element as the pivot. So pivot = arr[-1].\n\nThen, I need to partition the array into elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot. I can create three lists: left for elements less than the pivot, middle for equal, and right for greater. Initialize them as empty lists.\n\nLoop through each element in the array. For each element, if it's less than the pivot, add to left. If equal, add to middle. If greater, add to right.\n\nAfter partitioning, the idea is to recursively sort the left and right partitions and then combine everything. So the function would return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right).\n\nWait, this is the approach without using in-place partitioning. This way, it's simpler to implement but might use more memory because it creates new lists.\n\nLet me put this together:\n\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = []\n    middle = []\n    right = []\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        elif num == pivot:\n            middle.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But I should test this logic. Let's say the array is [3,1,4,2]. Pivot is 2. Then left is [1], middle is [2], right is [3,4]. Recursively sort left gives [1], sort right gives [3,4]. So combined, [1] + [2] + [3,4] = [1,2,3,4]. That works.\n\nAnother test case: empty array returns empty. Single element returns itself. What about duplicates? Suppose [2,2,1]. Pivot is 1. Left is empty, middle is [1], right is [2,2]. Then quick_sort(right) will have pivot as 2, and both elements are equal, so middle would have both 2s. So the result is [ ] + [1] + [2,2] = [1,2,2]. Correct.\n\nI think this logic should work. Now, I'll write out each line explaining it as per the example.\n</think>\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the quick sort function:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    # Base case: If the array is empty or has one element, it's already sorted.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    # Select the last element as the pivot.\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    \n    # Initialize three lists to partition elements: left (less than pivot), middle (equal), right (greater).\n    left = []\n    middle = []\n    right = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the array to partition.\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < pivot:\n            left.append(num)\n        elif num == pivot:\n            middle.append(num)\n        else:\n            right.append(num)\n    \n    # Recursively apply quick_sort to left and right partitions, then combine with middle.\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n```\n\n**Line-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Function Definition:** The function `quick_sort` takes an array `arr` as input.\n\n2. **Base Case Check:** If the array has 0 or 1 elements, it's returned immediately since it's already sorted.\n\n3. **Pivot Selection:** The last element of the array is chosen as the pivot to partition the array.\n\n4. **Initialization of Partition Lists:** Three lists are created to store elements less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot.\n\n5. **Loop Through Elements:** Each element is compared to the pivot and appended to the appropriate list.\n\n6. **Recursive Sorting:** The function recursively sorts the `left` and `right` partitions and concatenates them with the `middle` list, which contains elements equal to the pivot.\n\nThis implementation efficiently sorts the array using the quick sort algorithm with a clear and concise approach.",
