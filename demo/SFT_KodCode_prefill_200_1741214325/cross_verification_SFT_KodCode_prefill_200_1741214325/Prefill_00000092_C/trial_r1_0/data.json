  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have to solve this problem where I need to sort a list of tuples. The sorting should be done based on the second element in each tuple, and if two tuples have the same second element, then I should sort them by the first element. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, let me think about how tuples are usually sorted in Python. I remember that when you sort tuples, by default it sorts them by the first element, and if those are equal, then it moves to the second, and so on. So in the default sort, the tuples are compared element-wise.\n\nBut in this problem, the primary key for sorting is the second item, and secondary is the first. That's the opposite of the default. So how do I change that?\n\nOh right, I can use the key function in the sorted() method. The key function can transform the tuples into something that when sorted, achieves the desired order. Or maybe I can create a custom key that makes the second item the primary point of comparison.\n\nWait, another approach: I can reverse the order of the tuple. Like, create a key that returns (y, x) for each tuple (x, y). Then, when I sort these, they will be sorted first by y, then by x, which is exactly what I want.\n\nSo for each tuple in the list, I can have the key be (second_tuple_element, first_tuple_element). That makes sense.\n\nLet me test with an example. Suppose I have the list [(1,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2)]. Applying the key as (second, first), the tuples become (3,1), (1,4), (2,5), (2,3). So when I sort these, it should order them based on 1, then 2s, then 3. For the two with second 2, they are compared based on first element. So (2,3) comes before (2,5) when sorted in ascending order, which means in the original, the tuple (3,2) comes before (5,2).\n\nYes, so when I use this key, I can then use the sorted function on the list with this key, and it will give me the desired order.\n\nSo the plan is: write a function that takes the list of tuples. Then, return a new list where the tuples are sorted using the key I mentioned.\n\nI can also think about whether the sorted function is stable. But in this case, since the key defines a total order, it should be fine.\n\nWait, but in Python, the default for sorted is to sort in ascending order. So for the second element, smaller comes first, which is what the examples show. Like the first example, after sorting, the second elements are 1, then 2, then 2, then 3, which makes sense.\n\nSo implementing this is straightforward. The function will use sorted() with a custom key. The key for each tuple is (t[1], t[0]).\n\nWait, let me recheck with the examples. Let's take the first sample input: [(1, 3), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 2)]. The sorted output is [(4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3)]. So using the key (t[1], t[0]) on each tuple.\n\nBreaking down each tuple:\n(1,3) \u2192 (3,1)\n(4,1) \u2192 (1,4)\n(5,2) \u2192 (2,5)\n(3,2) \u2192 (2,3)\n\nWhen sorted, these keys would be: (1,4) \u2192 because 1 is first. Then comes (2,3), then (2,5), then (3,1). So the order in the sorted list is:\n\n[(4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3)], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, take the second test case: [(2,2), (3,1), (1,2), (4,1)]. The expected output is [(3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2)].\n\nThe keys would be:\n(2 \u2192 (2,2)\n(3,1) \u2192 (1,3)\n(1,2) \u2192 (2,1)\n(4,1) \u2192 (1,4)\n\nSorted based on key:\n(1,3) \u2192 (1,4) [since the first elements are 1, 1 and then 3 <4]. Wait no: the first elements for (3,1) and (4,1) are 1 and 1 in their keys? Wait no, the key for (3,1) is (1,3) and for (4,1) it's (1,4). So when sorted, which key comes first? Let's see:\n\nThe key of (3,1) is (1,3), and the key of (4,1) is (1,4). So in ascending order, (1,3) comes before (1,4). So the order between these two tuples is (3,1) comes first because its key comes before in the sorted list.\n\nWait, but the expected output for the second test case is [(3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2)]. So the first two tuples are sorted correctly based on second item, then first.\n\nWait, no. The second and first elements of each in the list are like (2,2), which has second element 2, and (3,1) has second element 1.\n\nWait the second test case input is [(2,2), (3,1), (1,2), (4,1)], and the expected output is [(3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2)].\n\nSo their tuples sorted by second element first, then first. So (3,1) and (4,1) have second element 1, which is the smallest, so they come first. Then, their first elements are 3 and4, so (3,1) comes before (4,1).\n\nNext, the tuples with second element 2: the tuples are (1,2) and (2,2). Their first elements are 1 and 2, so (1,2) comes before (2,2). Hence the correct output.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nThe plan is clear: in the function, sort the list using the key as (t[1], t[0]). So each tuple is transformed into a key where the first element is the second item of the tuple, and the second element is the first item. This way, the sorted function orders them as we need.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nThe function is called sort_tuples and takes a list of tuples. The code would be:\n\nreturn sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\nWait, yes.\n\nWait, but I should test if this is correct. Let me test the sample inputs with this key.\n\nSample 1: Key for (1,3) is (3,1) \u2192 no, wait no. Wait no, the key is (x[1], x[0]), so for (1,3), it's (3,1). For (4,1) it's (1,4). The sorted function will arrange these keys in ascending order, so (1,4) comes first, then (2,3) and (2,5), but wait, which comes first among (2,3) and (2,5)? Let's see: for the tuples who have second element 2, like (5,2) and (3,2), their keys are (2,5) and (2,3). So after (2,3) comes (2,5) because 3 <5 in the second element of the key. So the tuple with key (2,3) is (3,2), and the next one is (5,2). So the order is 1,2,3 as in the key.\n\nYes, so when you apply this, the sample input 1 will be correctly output.\n\nSample 4: [(1,1), (2,2), (3,1)] \u2192 the keys are (1,1), (2,2), (1,3). So when sorted, they are ordered by the keys: (1,1) and (1,3) come before (2,2). Between (1,1) and (1,3), the second element of the key is 1 and 3, so (1,1) comes first. So the output is [(1,1), (3,1), (2,2)], which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [(10,10), (5,5), (7,8)] \u2192 keys are (10,10), (5,5), (8,7). Wait, no. Wait, no: the tuple (7,8) in the list, the key is (8,7). So the keys are [(10,10), (5,5), (8,7)]. When sorted, the order is based first on the first element of the key:\n\n5,5 comes first, because 5<8<10.\n\nThen 7,8's key is (8,7), which is larger than 5,5 but less than 10,10.\n\nSo the sorted order is [(5,5), (7,8), (10,10)], which is the expected output.\n\nTherefore, the function as written with that key will correctly handle all the sample cases.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nWe can implement this as using the sorted function with a lambda that returns (x[1], x[0]).\n\nSo the function is:\n\ndef sort_tuples(lst: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\nThat's all!\n\nNow, wait, I'm using the sorted function, which returns a new list. So the function doesn't modify the original list, which is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nI think this should solve the problem.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. If two tuples have the same second element, we then sort them by the first element. \n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a custom sorting key. By default, tuples are sorted lexicographically (i.e., by the first element, then the second, etc.). However, we need to sort primarily by the second element. To achieve this, we can transform each tuple into a key where the first element of the key is the second element of the tuple, and the second element of the key is the first element of the tuple. \n\nThis transformation ensures that the tuples are sorted first by their second element and then by their first element if the second elements are equal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sort_tuples(lst: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Custom Key Transformation**: Each tuple `(a, b)` is transformed into a key `(b, a)`. This transformation allows the `sorted()` function to sort the tuples based on `b` (the second element) first and then on `a` (the first element) if `b` values are the same.\n2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with the custom key to sort the list of tuples. This ensures that the primary sorting is done by the second element and secondary sorting by the first element when the second elements are equal.\n\nThe provided solution efficiently handles the sorting using Python's built-in functionality, ensuring clarity and optimal performance.",
