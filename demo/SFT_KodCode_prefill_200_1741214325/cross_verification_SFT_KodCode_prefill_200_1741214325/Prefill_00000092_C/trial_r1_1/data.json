  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I have this problem where I need to sort a list of tuples. The sorting should be done based on the second item in each tuple, and if two tuples have the same second item, then I should sort those by the first item. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nSo, in Python, we can use the sorted() function which allows us to specify a key for sorting. But by default, it's done in ascending order. But since the problem doesn't specify whether it's ascending or descending, let me check the examples. Looking at the first example: [(1,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2)] becomes [(4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3)]. Oh right, the second items are sorted in ascending order\u20141, 2, 2, 3. And for the tuples with the same second item, like (3,2) and (5,2), they are ordered by the first item as 3 and 5, which is also ascending.\n\nWait, so the sorted function's default behavior should work. So, I think the key will be based on the tuple's elements. Since each tuple has two elements, maybe I need to sort by the second element first and then the first.\n\nSo in the sorted function, I can provide a key that returns a tuple where the second element comes first, followed by the first. Because when you sort tuples, they are compared element-wise.\n\nSo for a tuple (a, b), the key should be (b, a) I think. Then when sorted() compares the keys, it will first compare the b's, and if they're equal, compare the a's.\n\nWait, but how does that align with the examples? Let's take the first example:\n\nOriginal list: [(1,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2)]\nIf we make the key as (second, first), then the keys become:\n(3,1), (1,4), (2,5), (2,3)\nNow when we sort these keys, it's sorted based on the first elements (the second tuple elements):\n\n1 comes first, so (1,4) is first.\nNext, 2 from (2,5) and (2,3). Wait, but between (2,5) and (2,3), which comes first? Because 3 is less than 5, the tuple (2,3) comes before (2,5). So the order would be (2,3), then (2,5).\n\nSo the sorted list would order the original tuples according to the keys:\n\n[(4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3)] \u2014 which matches the expected output.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the key should be a tuple where the first element is the second element of the original tuple, and the second element is the first element.\n\nSo in the sorted function, I can set key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]). That way, it first sorts by x[1], and then by x[0].\n\nAlternatively, since sorted is stable when keys are equal, this should handle the ties correctly.\n\nSo putting this together, the function can be written as returning the sorted list with this key.\n\nAnother thing to consider: are the tuples to be sorted in-place, or is a new sorted list returned? Since the examples show new lists, and the function returns a list, I should use the sorted() function, which returns a new list, rather than the in-place sort() method of lists.\n\nSo the code inside the function would be simply: return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])).\n\nWait, let me make sure by thinking of the corner cases.\n\nWhat about an empty list? Or tuples where all second elements are the same, then the first elements are used. That should work.\n\nAnother example: [(2,2), (3,1), (1,2), (4,1)] become [(3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2)]. Using the key (second, first) on each tuple:\n\n(2,2) gives (2,2)\n(3,1) gives (1,3)\n(1,2) gives (2,1)\n(4,1) gives (1,4)\n\nSorting these keys: (1,3) comes before (1,4), then (2,1), then (2,2). So the tuples will be ordered as (3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2) \u2014 which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [(1,5), (2,4), (3,4)] becomes [(2,4), (3,4), (1,5)]. The keys are (5,1), (4,2), (4,3). These keys are (5,1) is larger than (4,2) and (4,3)? No, wait, 4 is less than 5. So the keys sorted would first those with 4, then 5.\n\nWithin the 4s: (4,2) comes before (4,3). So in the sorted list, the tuples with keys (4,2) is (2,4), then (4,3) is (3,4), and lastly (5,1) is (1,5). Which matches.\n\nAnd for the test case where multiple second elements are same, and the first elements vary:\n\n[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)]:\n\nKeys are (1,1), (2,2), (1,3).\n\nWhen sorted, the keys are in order: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). So the tuples are [(1,1), (3,1), (2,2)] \u2014 which matches the sample.\n\nLastly, the sample with [(10,10), (5,5), (7,8)] gives [(5,5), (7,8), (10,10)] which would be sorted by the second elements in ascending order, 5,8,10. Correct.\n\nSo, seems like the key function is correct.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward: in the function, return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])).\n\nI think that's all that's needed.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sort a list of tuples primarily by the second item in each tuple. If two tuples have the same second item, we then sort them by the first item in ascending order.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem leverages Python's built-in sorting capabilities. Specifically, we use the `sorted()` function, which allows us to specify a custom sorting key. The key is a function that transforms each tuple into a value that will be used for comparison during sorting.\n\nFor each tuple `(a, b)`, we will use the key `(b, a)`. This transformation ensures that:\n1. Tuples are sorted first by the second item `b` in ascending order.\n2. If two tuples have the same second item `b`, they are then sorted by the first item `a` in ascending order.\n\nThus, the sorting key is a tuple where the first element is the second item of the original tuple and the second element is the first item of the original tuple. This guarantees that the sorting is done as per the problem requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sort_tuples(lst: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input:** A list of tuples, where each tuple contains exactly two integers.\n- **Sorting Key:** Each tuple `(a, b)` is transformed into `(b, a)` to ensure primary sorting by the second item and secondary sorting by the first item.\n- **Output:** A new list of tuples sorted according to the specified criteria.\n\nBy using the `sorted()` function with this custom key, we efficiently achieve the desired sorting order in O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the number of tuples in the list. This approach ensures clarity, correctness, and optimal performance.",
