  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called sort_tuples that takes a list of tuples, each containing two integers, and sorts them. The sorting should be done first by the second item of the tuple. If two tuples have the same second item, then I sort those by the first item.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. So, I remember that in Python, when you sort tuples, by default it sorts them lexicographically, which means it compares each element in order. So if we have tuple1 = (a, b) and tuple2 = (c, d), it will first compare a and c. If a is less than c, then tuple1 comes before tuple2. If a equals c, then it compares b and d.\n\nBut in this problem, I need to sort primarily by the second element. So the main key for sorting should be the second item in the tuples. And when those are equal, then the first item is used as a secondary key.\n\nHow do I change the sort order? I think I can use the sorted() function with a key parameter. The key function would extract the values I want to sort by.\n\nWait, should I use a custom key function for this? Because the default is to sort by the entire tuple, which isn't what I want. I need to sort by the second element first, then the first.\n\nSo the key should return a tuple that has the second element followed by the first element. Because when sorted, it will first compare the second elements. If they are equal, it will look at the first elements.\n\nRight, so the key should be a lambda that takes each tuple and returns (t[1], t[0]).\n\nSo I can call sorted() on the list, with the key being lambda x: (x[1], x[0]).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see. Suppose we have two tuples (3, 2) and (5, 2). The key for both would be (2,3) and (2,5). So when comparing these two keys, (2,3) comes before (2,5) because 3 <5, so sorted would put (3,2) before (5,2), which is correct.\n\nLet me test that logic with the examples given.\n\nIn the first example, [(1,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2)], we expect after sorting to have the tuples ordered by the second item, which should be 1 first, then 2, then 3.\n\nOriginal list: The second items are 3, 1, 2, 2.\n\nThe desired sorted list starts with (4,1) as it has the second item 1.\n\nThen, the tuples with second item 2: in the original list, they are (5,2), (3,2). The key for both would be (2,5) and (2,3). So (2,3) comes before (2,5), so (3,2) comes before (5,2). So the order in the sorted list would be (4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3).\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nWait, but wait, in the input list, the tuples (5,2) is in position 2, (3,2) is in position 3. But according to key (2,3) and (2,5), the sorted function would order them as (3,2) comes before (5,2).\n\nSo the function would properly arrange them.\n\nAnother test case: [(2,2), (3,1), (1,2), (4,1)]\n\nAfter sorting, the second items should be in order 1,1,2,2. So the tuples (3,1), (4,1) come first. What is the key for (3,1)? It's (1,3). For (4,1): (1,4). So (3,1) comes before (4,1). Then, (1,2) with key (2,1), and (2,2) with key (2,2). So sorted list will be [ (3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2) ] which is correct as per the sample.\n\nSo I think using the key function lambda x: (x[1], x[0]) will correctly sort the list as required.\n\nSo the function can be as simple as returning sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])).\n\nWait, but wait, does the sorted function in Python handle tuples correctly with that key? Let's make sure.\n\nYes, because when you pass a key function, each element is transformed into the key, and then the default compare is done on those keys, which for tuples is lexicographic. So yes, the key tuple (x[1], x[0]) will first compare x[1]s, then x[0]s.\n\nSo I can implement it as:\n\nreturn sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\nLet me test another sample.\n\nSample input: [(1,5), (2,4), (3,4)] \u2192 expected output [(2,4), (3,4), (1,5)].\n\nEach element's key would be (5,1), (4,2), (4,3). So when we sort, the order of the keys would be (4,2), (4,3), (5,1). So the tuples corresponding would be (2,4), then (3,4), then (1,5). Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: [(1,1), (2,2), (3,1)] \u2192 sorted should first consider the second elements. The second elements are 1,2,1. So the desired order is 1,1,2. So tuples (1,1) and (3,1) have second item 1. So for them, we look at the first item, ordered 1 and 3. So (1,1) comes before (3,1). Then (2,2). So the sorted list is [ (1,1), (3,1), (2,2) ].\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all the cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the function definition, the parameter is annotated as List[Tuple[int, int]]. So the function receives a list of tuples, each with two ints. But when we use the sorted function, does it maintain the same type? Because sorted returns a new list, and each element is still a tuple of two ints, so it's compatible.\n\nSo the function's return type is also List[Tuple[int, int]], which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the implementation is correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe can write the function as:\n\ndef sort_tuples(lst: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\nThat's it.\n\nWait, that's so simple, but let me double-check the sample inputs.\n\nWait, for the first sample, when I call sorted with the key as x: (x[1], x[0]), the list [(1,3), (4,1), (5,2), (3,2)] becomes:\n\nAfter extracting the key for each element: \n\n(3,1), (1,4), (2,5), (2,3).\n\nWait, no, the key is (x[1], x[0]).\n\nSo for (1,3), the key is (3,1). For (4,1), the key is (1,4). For (5,2), (2,5). For (3,2), (2,3).\n\nSo when we collect the keys, the list is [(3,1), (1,4), (2,5), (2,3)].\n\nNow, sorted() will sort these keys in order. Comparing tuples:\n\nThe first elements are 1, 2, 2, 3, so the key (1,4) comes first, then (2,3), then (2,5), then (3,1). So the tuples in the original list are ordered accordingly: the tuple with key (1,4) is (4,1), then the tuple with key (2,3) is (3,2), then (2,5) \u2192 (5,2), then (3,1) \u2192 (1,3). So the sorted list is [(4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (1,3)], which matches the sample.\n\nAll other examples seem to be handled correctly.\n\nThus, this implementation should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sort a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers. The sorting should be done primarily by the second element of each tuple. If two tuples have the same second element, they should then be sorted by their first element.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a custom key. The key function will transform each tuple into a new tuple where the order of elements is reversed to prioritize the second element first and the first element second. This transformation ensures that when the `sorted()` function compares two tuples, it first compares their second elements, and if those are equal, it then compares their first elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef sort_tuples(lst: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n    return sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to sort tuples based on their second element first and their first element second if the second elements are equal.\n2. **Key Insight**: By transforming each tuple into a key `(second_element, first_element)`, we ensure that the sorting is done in the desired order.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using Python's `sorted()` function allows us to leverage its efficiency and simplicity. The custom key function provided to `sorted()` ensures the correct sorting order.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of the sorting operation is O(n log n), where n is the number of tuples, which is efficient for this problem.\n\nThis approach efficiently and correctly sorts the list of tuples according to the specified criteria.",
