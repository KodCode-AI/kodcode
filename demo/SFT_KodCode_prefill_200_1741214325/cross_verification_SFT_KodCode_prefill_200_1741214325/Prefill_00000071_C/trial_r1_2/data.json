  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Hmm, how do I approach this? Well, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that including numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 can cause duplicates. So maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. Oh right! The principle says that the count of numbers divisible by 3 or 5 is equal to the count for 3 plus the count for 5 minus the count for 15, since 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5.\n\nSo the plan is to find the sum of multiples of 3 below 1000, add the sum of multiples of 5, then subtract the sum of multiples of 15 to avoid double-counting.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the sum of all multiples for a given number? Oh right, arithmetic series. For any number k, the sum of its multiples below n can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe formula is sum = k * m * (m + 1) / 2, where m is the largest integer such that k*m is less than n. So for each of 3, 5, and 15, I'll calculate m as (n - 1) // k, because we're looking for numbers below 1000. Then compute the sum using the formula.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find m for 3: m3 = (999) // 3 = 333. The sum for 3 is 3 * 333 * 334 / 2.\n2. Find m for 5: m5 = 999 //5 = 199. Sum5 is 5 *199 * 200 /2.\n3. Find m for 15: m15 = 999//15=66. Sum15 is 15*66*67/2.\n\nThen total_sum = sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nBut wait, let me calculate that:\n\nCalculate sum3:\n333 * 334 = let's compute, 333*334. Let's see, 333*(300+34) = 333*300=99900, 333*34=11322. Total 99900+11322=111222. Multiply by 3: 333 *334 is 111222, wait no, wait the sum is 3*(333*334/2). Wait, the formula is 3 * sum from 1 to m of k, which is k*(m)(m+1)/2. So wait, for k=3, the sum is 3*(1+2+...+333). The sum 1+..+n is n(n+1)/2. So 333*334/2 multiplied by 3. So 3*(333 * 334)/2.\n\n333*334 is 333*(300+34) = let's compute 333 * 300 = 99900, 333*34= 11322, total = 99900 + 11322 = 111222. Multiply by 3: wait no, wait (333*334) is 111222, multiplied by 3 gives 333,666. Then divided by 2? Wait no, let me get this straight.\n\nWait, the sum for 3 is 3 * (333*334)/2. So 333*334 = 111222, then 111222 /2 is 55611, then multiplied by 3 is 166833.\n\nWait, but I think I can just compute 3 +6 +9 + ...+999. Let me check if my formula is correct. The number of terms is 333 since 3*333=999. The formula for the sum is (number_of_terms / 2) * (first + last). So (333/2)*(3+999) = 333/2 * 1002 = 333 *501= let's compute that. 333 *500=166500, plus 333 is 166833. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSame for 5: the sum is 5*(199*200)/2. 199*200=39800, divided by 2 is 19900, multiplied by 5 gives 99500.\n\nFor 15: sum is 15*(66*67)/2. 66*67 is 4422, divided by 2 is 2211, multiplied by 15 equals 33,165.\n\nThen total sum is sum3 + sum5 - sum15. So 166833 +99500 = 266333. Then subtract 33,165, giving 233168. That's the answer.\n\nSo now I'll write the Python function accordingly.\n\nThe function will compute m3, m5, m15 as the integer division of 999 by 3, 5, 15. Then compute each sum and combine them.\n\nLet me write that.\n\nWait 3*m3*(m3+1)//2: because when m3 is 333, 3*333=999. So the sum is 3*(1+2+...333) = 3*(333*334)/2.\n\nSimilarly for 5, and subtract the 15 multiples.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    max_num = 999\n    m3 = max_num // 3\n    sum3 = 3 * m3 * (m3 + 1) // 2\n    m5 = max_num //5\n    sum5 =5 * m5 * (m5 +1)//2\n    m15 = max_num//15\n    sum15 =15 * m15 * (m15 +1)//2\n    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n\nTesting this, according to the sample it should return 233168.\n\nWait, wait! Let me compute sum3: 3*333*334//2.\n\n333*334 is 111222, 3* that is 333666, divided by 2 is 166833. Sum5 is 5*(199*200)/2 = 5*39800/2 =5*19900=99500. Sum3+sum5 is 266333. sum15 is 15*(66*67)/2 = 15*(4422/2)=15*2211=33165. Subtract: 266333-33165=233168. Correct.\n\nSo this function should work.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. This can be efficiently done using mathematical principles to avoid counting numbers multiple times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: To find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. This principle helps us avoid double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15).\n2. **Arithmetic Series Sum Formula**: For a given number \\( k \\), the sum of its multiples below \\( n \\) can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is \\( \\text{sum} = k \\times \\frac{m \\times (m + 1)}{2} \\), where \\( m \\) is the largest integer such that \\( k \\times m \\) is less than \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    max_num = 999\n    m3 = max_num // 3\n    sum3 = 3 * m3 * (m3 + 1) // 2\n    m5 = max_num // 5\n    sum5 = 5 * m5 * (m5 + 1) // 2\n    m15 = max_num // 15\n    sum15 = 15 * m15 * (m15 + 1) // 2\n    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Calculate Multiples of 3**:\n   - Compute the largest integer \\( m3 \\) such that \\( 3 \\times m3 \\) is less than 1000.\n   - Use the arithmetic series sum formula to find the sum of multiples of 3.\n\n2. **Calculate Multiples of 5**:\n   - Compute the largest integer \\( m5 \\) such that \\( 5 \\times m5 \\) is less than 1000.\n   - Use the arithmetic series sum formula to find the sum of multiples of 5.\n\n3. **Calculate Multiples of 15**:\n   - Compute the largest integer \\( m15 \\) such that \\( 15 \\times m15 \\) is less than 1000.\n   - Use the arithmetic series sum formula to find the sum of multiples of 15.\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - Add the sums of multiples of 3 and 5, then subtract the sum of multiples of 15 to avoid double-counting.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sum using mathematical principles, resulting in an optimal solution.",
