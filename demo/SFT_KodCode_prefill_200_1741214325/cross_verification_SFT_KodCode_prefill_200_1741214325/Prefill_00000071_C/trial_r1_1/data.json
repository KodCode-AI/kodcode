  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called sum_of_multiples that calculates the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the problem statement says I have to find all numbers less than 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5. Once I have those numbers, I sum them up.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem better. Multiples of 3 are numbers like 3,6,9,... up to 999. Same with multiples of 5: 5,10,15... up to 995. But wait, if I just add all multiples of 3 and all multiples of 5, I might be double-counting some numbers. Like 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5. So adding both would count it twice, which is incorrect.\n\nOh right, so this is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. The correct approach is to add the sum of multiples of 3, add the sum of multiples of 5, and then subtract the sum of multiples of 15 (since 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5) to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, how do I calculate the sum of all multiples of a number below a limit? I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated with the formula. For a given number k, the multiples are k, 2k, 3k,... up to the largest multiple less than the limit.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's say my limit is n (which is 1000 in this case). For a number m, the number of multiples is given by n divided by m, taking the floor of that (because we want the largest integer less than or equal to n/m). The sum would then be m * (k * (k + 1)) / 2, where k is the number of multiples.\n\nRight, so for each m (which will be 3,5,15 in our case), the sum is m * (k) * (k+1) / 2, where k is floor((n-1)/m).\n\nWait, why n-1? Oh because the problem specifies below 1000. So 999 is the maximum considered. So for multiples of 3, the largest is 999 if 999 is divisible by 3, which it is.\n\nSo let's get specific. For m=3:\n\nk = (999) // 3 = 333. So sum is 3 * 333 * (333 +1)/2. That simplifies to 3*(333*334)/2.\n\nSimilarly for m=5: 999//5 is 199. Sum is 5*(199*200)/2.\n\nFor m=15: 999//15 is 66. Sum is 15*(66*67)/2.\n\nSo total sum is sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nWait, because if you just add sum3 and sum5, the numbers that are multiples of both (i.e., 15) get added twice, so subtracting sum15 (the multiples of 15) once gives the correct total.\n\nCalculating all this manually would be error-prone, but we can code it.\n\nSo the plan for the code is:\n\n1. Define variables for the limit, which is 1000. But since it's below 1000, n is 999.\n\n2. For each m in [3,5,15], calculate k as n // m.\n\n3. For each m, compute the sum using the formula m * k * (k+1) // 2.\n\n4. Compute the total as sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nWait, but wait: When we compute sum of 3 and sum of 5, subtract sum of 15 to exclude the duplicates.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute up to 1000 exclusive, which is how it's worded.\n\nSo the steps in code would look more concrete. Let me think.\n\nFirst, define the limit:\n\nlimit = 1000\n\nBut in our calculation, n is 999, as 999 is the maximum number included. So perhaps in code, n = limit - 1.\n\nBut let's see:\n\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n\nCalculate sum3, sum5, sum15.\n\nLet's compute each:\n\nsum3 = sum of multiples of 3 below 1000.\n\nsum5 = sum of multiples of 5 below 1000.\n\nsum15 = sum of multiples of 15 below 1000.\n\nTotal = sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nYes, that should give the correct result.\n\nNow, how to compute each sum?\n\nFor multiples of 3: multiples are 3,6,..., max multiple <= 999.\n\nNumber of terms: k = 999 // 3 = 333.\n\nSum3 = 3 * (333*(333 +1)) // 2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    limit = 1000\n    n = limit -1  # because below 1000\n    sum3 = 3 * (k * (k +1) // 2) where k = n//3\n    similarly for others.\n\nWait, coding that:\n\nsum3 = 3 * ((n //3) * (n//3 +1) ) // 2\n\nWait, no. Let me compute the k for 3 first. \n\nk_3 = n // 3  # 999/3=333\n\nsum_of_3 = 3 * k_3 * (k_3 + 1) // 2\n\nSame for 5 and 15.\n\nSo the code could look like this:\n\nk3 = (limit -1) // 3\n\nsum3 = 3 * k3 * (k3 +1) // 2\n\nk5 = (limit -1) //5\n\nsum5 = 5 * k5*(k5 +1) //2\n\nk15 = (limit -1) //15\n\nsum15 =15 * k15*(k15 +1) //2\n\ntotal = sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n\nThen return total.\n\nWait, but in code, it's more precise to compute k3 as (n) //3 where n = limit-1.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nn = limit -1 = 999\n\nk3 = n //3 = 333\n\nsum3 =3 * (333 * 334) //2 \n\nWhich is 3* (333*334)/2.\n\nCompute that: 333 *334 is? Well, 333 * 334 is 333*(300+34) = 333*300=99900, 333*34=11322; sum 99900+11322=111222. Then divide by 2: 111222 /2 =55611. Multiply by 3: 55611 *3 = 166833.\n\nSimilarly sum5:\n\nn//5 =199\n\nsum5 is5*(199 * 200)/2 =5*(39800)/2 =5*19900 =99500.\n\nsum15:\n\nn//15= 66\n\nsum15= 15*(66*67)/2 \n\n66*67=4422. Divide by2:2211. Multiply by15: 2211*15=33165.\n\nSo total is 166833 + 99500 - 33165.\n\nCalculate:\n\n166833 +99500=266333\n\nSubtract 33165: 266333 -33165 =233168. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nIn code:\n\nCalculate n as 999.\n\nCompute sum3, sum5, sum15 as per the above.\n\nReturn sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    limit = 1000\n    n = limit -1\n    k3 = n // 3\n    sum3 = 3 * (k3 * (k3 +1)) // 2\n    k5 = n //5\n    sum5 =5 * (k5 * (k5 +1))//2\n    k15 = n//15\n    sum15 =15 * (k15 * (k15 +1)) //2\n    total = sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n    return total\n\nLet me test this with n=10 as a small case.\n\nWait, say for numbers below 10.\n\nMultiples of 3:3,6,9 \u2192 sum=3+6+9=18.\n\nMultiples of 5:5 \u2192 sum=5.\n\nNow, what about multiples of 15 below 10? None.\n\nSo total is 18+5=23.\n\nRunning the code with limit=10:\n\nn=9.\n\nk3=3 \u2192 sum3=3*(3*4)/2= 3*12/2=18.\n\nk5=1 \u2192 sum5=5*2/2=5 \u2192 5*(1*2)/2 =5.\n\nk15=0 \u2192 sum15=0. So 18+5-0=23. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test: limit=16.\n\nMultiples of 3 below16:3,6,9,12,15 \u2192 sum is 3+6=9, 9+9=18, 18+12=30, 30+15=45 \u2192 sum3=45.\n\nMultiples of5:5,10,15 \u2192 sum is5+10=15 +15=30 \u2192 sum5=30? Wait, wait:5,10,15 are multiples of5 below16.\n\nWait,15 is included, it's 15<16.\n\nWait no: no, 15 is below 16. So yes.\n\nWait calculation in code:\n\nlimit=16 \u2192n=15.\n\nk3=15//3=5 \u2192 sum3=3*(5*6)/2=3*(30)/2=45.\n\nk5=15//5=3 \u2192 sum5=5*(3*4)/2= 5*(12/2)=5*6=30.\n\nk15=15//15=1 \u2192 sum15=15*(1*2)/2= 15*1=15.\n\nSo total is 45+30-15=60.\n\nWhat is manual calculation:\n\nSum of multiples of3:3,6,9,12,15 \u2192sum 3+6=9+9=18+12=30+15=45.\n\nMultiples of5:5,10,15 \u2192 sum is 5+10=15+15=30. But 15 is included in both.\n\nSo when you add sum3+sum5, the 15 is included twice. So for the sum, you should subtract one sum15.\n\nBut in reality, how much is the total sum of numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5.\n\nIn this case, numbers are 3,5,6,9,10,12,15.\n\nSum:3+5=8+6=14+9=23+10=33+12=45+15=60. Which is indeed what the code gives.\n\nSo yes, the code works.\n\nThus, the function should return 233168 when limit is 1000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. This problem can be efficiently solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Target Numbers**: We need to consider numbers below 1000 that are multiples of either 3 or 5.\n2. **Avoid Double-Counting**: Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15) should be counted only once. This is where the inclusion-exclusion principle comes into play.\n3. **Sum of Multiples**: Calculate the sum of multiples for each target number (3, 5, and 15) using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is given by \\( S = m \\times \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\), where `m` is the multiple and `n` is the number of terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    limit = 1000\n    n = limit - 1  # Since we consider numbers below 1000\n\n    # Calculate sum for multiples of 3\n    k3 = n // 3\n    sum3 = 3 * (k3 * (k3 + 1)) // 2\n\n    # Calculate sum for multiples of 5\n    k5 = n // 5\n    sum5 = 5 * (k5 * (k5 + 1)) // 2\n\n    # Calculate sum for multiples of 15 to avoid double-counting\n    k15 = n // 15\n    sum15 = 15 * (k15 * (k15 + 1)) // 2\n\n    # Apply inclusion-exclusion principle\n    total = sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n    return total\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sum of Multiples of 3**: We first compute the sum of all multiples of 3 below 1000. The number of terms is given by `n // 3`, where `n` is 999 (since we need numbers below 1000). Using the arithmetic series formula, we calculate the sum efficiently.\n2. **Sum of Multiples of 5**: Similarly, we compute the sum of all multiples of 5 below 1000 using the same approach.\n3. **Sum of Multiples of 15**: To correct for double-counting, we calculate the sum of multiples of 15 (the least common multiple of 3 and 5) and subtract this sum from the total of the sums of multiples of 3 and 5.\n4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: By adding the sums of multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtracting the sum of multiples of 15, we ensure that each number is counted exactly once.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired sum with a time complexity of O(1), as it involves only a few arithmetic operations.",
