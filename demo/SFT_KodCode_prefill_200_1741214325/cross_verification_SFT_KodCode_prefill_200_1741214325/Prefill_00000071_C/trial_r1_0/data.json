  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called sum_of_multiples that finds the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Hmm, so the first thing I should figure out is how to generate all numbers below 1000 that are divisible by either 3 or 5 without duplicates, and then sum them up.\n\nWait, but there's a catch. Some numbers are multiples of both 3 and 5, like 15, 30, etc. So if I just add all multiples of 3 and all multiples of 5, I'll be double-counting those numbers that are multiples of both. Oh right, because 15 is a multiple of 3 and 5, and including it in both sums will count it twice. So I need to find the sum of multiples of 3, plus the sum of multiples of 5, minus the sum of multiples of 15. That way, I subtract the overlap to get the correct total.\n\nSo how do I calculate the sum of multiples of a number up to a limit? Like, for a multiple k, the numbers would be k, 2k, 3k,... up to just below 1000. So I need a function to find the sum of such a series.\n\nWait, there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum is n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. So for multiples of k, the last term is the largest multiple of k less than 1000.\n\nLet me think. For k, the last term l is the largest number less than 1000 that's a multiple of k. So l would be (1000 // k) * k. But wait, since it's below 1000, it should be less than 1000. For example, if k is 3, then 999 is a multiple of 3, right? So yes, l = k * (999 // k) would give 999 if 999 is divisible by k. But wait, 1000//k gives the integer division, which truncates. Then multiplying by k. Hmm, but for numbers where 1000 isn't exactly divisible by k, this works fine. Because 1000//k would be one less than the actual division.\n\nWait, for example, 4: 1000//4 is 250, so 4 * 250 = 1000. But since we're looking for multiples below 1000, 1000 shouldn't be included. So in that case, when 1000 is exactly a multiple of k, we need to subtract k. Or perhaps I should compute how many terms there are correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to find the number of terms as (999) // k. Because that way, for 3: 999//3 is 333, so 333 terms. Starting from 3 up to 999, which is 3*333=999. Similarly, for 5, 999//5 is 199, so terms are 5, 10,...995. Then for 15, same approach.\n\nSo for a general k, sum of all multiples below 1000 is (number_of_terms) * (k + last_term) // 2.\n\nNumber_of_terms would be (999 // k). Then the last term is k * (999 // k).\n\nAlternatively, sum = k * (n * (n + 1)) ) // 2, where n is (999 // k). Because the sum of the first n multiples of k is k*(1+2+3+...+n) = k*(n(n+1)/2).\n\nYes, that works. So for 3, sum is 3*(333*334)//2, since 333 is 999//3. Let's compute that: 3*(333*334)/2.\n\nSo for the function, I can compute the sum for 3 using this formula, sum for 5 using same, and sum for 15, then add sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nWait, why 15? Because 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5, so all multiples of 15 are the numbers that are multiples of both.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nCompute sum3 as 3 * (n3)*(n3 +1)/2, where n3 is 999//3.\n\nSimilarly for sum5.\n\nn3=999//3=333.\n\nsum3=3*(333 *334)/2.\n\nSimilarly for sum5: n5= 199, sum5=5*(199 *200)/2.\n\nsum15: n15= 66, since 999//15 is 66. Because 15*66=990, 15*67=1005 which is over. So sum15 is 15*(66*67)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute each of these and then add sum3 + sum5 - sum15.\n\nAlternatively, in code, I can do this:\n\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    def sum_multiple(k):\n        n = 999 //k\n        return k * n * (n+1) // 2\n\n    sum3 = sum_multiple(3)\n    sum5 = sum_multiple(5)\n    sum15 = sum_multiple(15)\n\n    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n\nWait, but let's test this calculation.\n\nLet me calculate sum3:\n\n333 *334 = 333*300 is 99900, 333*34 is 11322, so 99900+11322=111222.\n\nMultiply by 3: 333*334 is 111222, multiplied by 3 is 333666. Then divided by 2: 333666 /2 =166833.\n\nsum3 = 166833.\n\nsum5: n=199.\n\n199 * 200 = 39800.\n\n5 * 39800 =199000, divided by 2 is 99500.\n\nsum5=99500.\n\nsum15: n=66.\n\n66*67=4422.\n\n15*4422=66330, divided by 2 is 33165.\n\nSo sum3 + sum5 is 166833 +99500 =266333.\n\nSubtract sum15: 266333 -33165= 233168.\n\nWhich matches the expected output of the function as given in the example.\n\nSo yes, this logic works.\n\nAlternatively, without using helper functions, another approach is to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 999 and check if they are divisible by 3 or 5, then add to the sum. But that could be less efficient for large numbers, but for 1000 it's fine. However, for very large upper limits, the formula is better.\n\nBut for this problem, either method should work.\n\nSo for the function, the approach is to compute the sum using the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThus, the code is as written.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. We can achieve this efficiently using the inclusion-exclusion principle, which helps us avoid double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Multiples**: Calculate the sum of all multiples of 3 below 1000.\n2. **Identify Multiples**: Calculate the sum of all multiples of 5 below 1000.\n3. **Avoid Double Counting**: Calculate the sum of all multiples of 15 below 1000 (since these are the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5).\n4. **Combine Results**: Add the sums of multiples of 3 and 5, then subtract the sum of multiples of 15 to correct for double-counting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples() -> int:\n    def sum_multiple(k):\n        n = 999 // k\n        return k * n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    sum3 = sum_multiple(3)\n    sum5 = sum_multiple(5)\n    sum15 = sum_multiple(15)\n    \n    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Helper Function**: `sum_multiple(k)` calculates the sum of all multiples of `k` below 1000 using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This formula efficiently computes the sum without iterating through each number.\n2. **Sum of Multiples of 3**: This is calculated by finding the number of terms (n) as 999 divided by 3, then using the arithmetic series sum formula.\n3. **Sum of Multiples of 5**: Similarly, this is calculated using the number of terms obtained by dividing 999 by 5.\n4. **Sum of Multiples of 15**: This is necessary to subtract the overlap where numbers are multiples of both 3 and 5.\n5. **Combining Results**: The final result is obtained by adding the sum of multiples of 3 and 5, then subtracting the sum of multiples of 15 to avoid double-counting.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired sum without unnecessary iterations, making it both time and space efficient.",
