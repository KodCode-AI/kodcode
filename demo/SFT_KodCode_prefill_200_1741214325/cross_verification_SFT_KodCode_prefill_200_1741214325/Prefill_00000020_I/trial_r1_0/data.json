  "r1_response": "<think>\nTo calculate the area of a triangle when given the base and height, I can use the formula \\((base \\times height) / 2\\).\n\nFirst, I'll define a function called `calculate_triangle_area` that takes two parameters: `base` and `height`.\n\nNext, I'll validate the inputs to ensure that both the base and height are positive numbers. This is important to avoid incorrect calculations or errors.\n\nThen, I'll compute the area by applying the formula and return the result.\n\nFinally, I'll add a docstring to the function to provide a description of what it does, and I'll include an example to demonstrate its usage.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height, you can use a simple formula in Python. Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Formula**: The area \\( A \\) of a triangle is given by the formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{base \\times height}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define a Function**: Create a function that takes the base and height as parameters.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area**: Inside the function, use the formula to compute the area.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated area.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing these steps:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_triangle_area(base, height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate and return the area of a triangle given its base and height.\n    \n    Args:\n        base (float): The base length of the triangle.\n        height (float): The height of the triangle.\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: The area of the triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # First, check if the inputs are valid (positive numbers)\n    if base <= 0 or height <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Base and height must be positive numbers.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the area using the formula (base * height) / 2\n    area = (base * height) / 2\n    \n    # Return the computed area\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\nbase = 5\nheight = 10\nprint(f\"The area of the triangle with base {base} and height {height} is {calculate_triangle_area(base, height)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Function Definition**: The function `calculate_triangle_area` takes two parameters: `base` and `height`.\n- **Validation**: Checks if both `base` and `height` are positive numbers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **Area Calculation**: Uses the formula \\( \\frac{base \\times height}{2} \\) to compute the area.\n- **Return Statement**: Returns the calculated area.\n\n**Example Use Case:**\n\n- **Input**: `base = 5`, `height = 10`\n- **Calculation**: \\( \\frac{5 \\times 10}{2} = 25 \\)\n- **Output**: The area of the triangle with base 5 and height 10 is 25.\n\nThis function will efficiently compute the area of a triangle given its base and height while ensuring that the inputs are valid.",
