  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called max_product that finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within an array of numbers. Hmm, so what's a contiguous subarray? It's just a sequence of numbers next to each other in the array, right? Like if the array is [2, 3, -1], a contiguous subarray could be [2,3] or [3,-1] or the whole array.\n\nSo the function is similar to the maximum subarray problem, but instead of sum, it's the product. I remember that for maximum sum, Kadane's algorithm is used. Maybe a similar approach can work here. Let me think: for each position, we can keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at that position, because multiplying a negative number can flip the maximum to a minimum or vice versa.\n\nLet me outline how this could work. For each element in the array:\n- We calculate the current maximum product by considering the previous maximum and minimum.\n- We also calculate the current minimum product because a negative number multiplied by a previous minimum could become the new maximum.\n- Then, we update the global maximum with the current maximum.\n\nWait, but what do we initialize these variables as? Maybe start with the first element. Let me see: the initial max_product and min_product can both be the first element. Then the global_max can be the first element as well.\n\nBut wait, after that, for each element from the second onwards, calculate the possible products. Let me see with an example.\n\nTake the array [2, 3, -1]. The possible subarrays:\n[2] product 2,\n[2,3] product 6,\n[2,3,-1] product -6,\n[3] product 3,\n[3,-1] product -3,\n[-1] product -1.\nSo the maximum is 6.\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\nInitialize current_max = current_min = global_max = 2.\n\nNext element is 3:\npossible products: 2*3=6 and 3. So current_max is max(6,3)=6.\ncurrent_min is min(6, 3)=3.\nBut wait, didn't we have current_min before, which is 2. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, for each step, the current_max is max(nums[i], current_max * nums[i], current_min * nums[i]), right? Because the new subarray can start at the current element (nums[i]), or extend from previous max or previous min.\n\nSo in the example:\n\nFor i=1 (nums[1]=3):\npossible products are 2*3=6 and 3. So current_max becomes max(3, 6)=6. Similarly, current_min is min(3,6)=3? Wait, but in some cases, the previous min multiplied could become a new min or max, but perhaps I should include all possibilities: current_max = nums[i], current_max * previous_max, current_max * previous_min. Then take the maximum.\n\nWait, actually, for each step:\n\ncurrent_max = max(nums[i], nums[i] * previous_max, nums[i] * previous_min)\n\ncurrent_min = min(nums[i], nums[i] * previous_max, nums[i] * previous_min)\n\nAnd then update global_max if current_max is larger.\n\nSo in the example:\n\nAt i=0, current_max and min are both 2, global_max is 2.\n\nAt i=1, nums[i]=3:\ncurrent_max = max(3, 2*3=6, 2*3=6) \u2192 6.\ncurrent_min = min(3,6,6) \u21923.\nglobal_max becomes 6.\n\nAt i=2, nums[i]=-1:\ncurrent_max = max(-1, 6*(-1)=-6, 3*(-1)=-3) \u2192 max of these is -1 (but since -1 is larger than the other negatives? Wait: -1 is larger than -6 and -3. Hmm, but the global_max was 6, which is still higher.\n\nWait, but if the current element is negative, the previous max and min can flip.\n\nSo in this case, the new current_max would be max of (-1, (6*-1), (3*-1)) \u2192 max(-1, -6, -3) \u2192-1.\n\ncurrent_min would be min of (-1, -6, -3) \u2192-6.\n\nglobal_max remains 6.\n\nAfter processing all elements, the global_max is 6.\n\nAnother example: [-2, -3, -4].\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe maximum product subarray would be [-2,-3,-4], product is (-2)*(-3)*(-4) = -24, but wait, alternatively maybe just taking [-2,-3] gives 6, which is higher than the other options.\n\nWait no.\n\nWait for array [-2, -3, -4], let's list all possible subarrays:\n\n[-2] \u2192-2,\n\n[-2,-3] \u21926,\n\n[-2,-3,-4] \u2192-24,\n\n[-3] \u2192-3,\n\n[-3,-4] \u219212,\n\n[-4] \u2192-4.\n\nSo the maximum is 12, which is the subarray [-3,-4].\n\nLet me apply the algorithm:\n\nInitialize current_max and current_min to -2. global_max is -2.\n\ni=1, nums[i]=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, (-2)*(-3)=6, (-2)*(-3)=6) \u21926.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, 6, 6) \u2192-3.\n\nglobal_max becomes max(-2,6)=6.\n\ni=2, nums[i]=-4.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-4, 6*(-4)=-24, (-3)*(-4)=12) \u2192max(-4,-24,12)=12.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-4, -24, 12) \u2192-24.\n\nglobal_max becomes max(6,12)=12.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works here.\n\nAnother test case: [0, -1, -2, -3].\n\nPossible subarrays:\n\n[0] \u21920,\n\n[0,-1] \u21920,\n\n[0,-1,-2] \u21920,\n\n[0,-1,-2,-3] \u21920,\n\n[-1] \u2192-1,\n\n[-1,-2] \u21922,\n\n[-1,-2,-3] \u21926,\n\n[-2] \u2192-2,\n\n[-2,-3] \u21926,\n\n[-3] \u2192-3.\n\nSo the maximum is 6.\n\nWait, with the algorithm:\n\nInitialize current_max = current_min = 0. global_max=0.\n\ni=1, nums[i]=-1.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-1, 0*(-1)=0, 0*(-1)=0) \u21920? Wait, no.\n\nWait current_max is the max of (-1, 0*-1=0, and 0*-1=0). So 0 is larger than -1. So current_max is 0. current_min is min(-1, 0,0) \u2192-1.\n\nBut that's not correct, because if you take the subarray [-1], the product is -1 which is less than 0. But we didn't get 2 or 6.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is insufficient in cases where there are zeros. Because when we have a zero, it can reset the product.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait in the example [0, -1, -2, -3], let's process step by step.\n\nAt i=0: num is 0. current_max and min are 0. global_max=0.\n\ni=1: num=-1.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-1, 0*-1=0, 0*-1=0) \u2192max(-1,0,0) is 0.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-1,0,0) \u2192-1.\n\nglobal_max remains 0.\n\nWait but there's a mistake here because when current_max can be either -1, 0*-1, or 0*-1, which are -1 and 0. So the maximum between those is 0. So the algorithm will not recognize the subarray starting at index1 with -1 and continue.\n\nBut in actuality, that subarray leads to a higher product when i=2: [-1,-2] \u2192 product is 2.\n\nWait when i=2, num=-2.\n\nSo current_max is the max of (-2, 0*-2=0, (-1)*-2=2) \u21922.\n\ncurrent_min is min(-2, 0, 2) \u2192-2.\n\nglobal_max becomes max(0, 2) \u21922.\n\nThen i=3, num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, 2*(-3)=-6, (-2)*-3=6) \u2192max(-3, -6,6)=6.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -6, 6) \u2192-6.\n\nglobal_max becomes 6.\n\nSo the algorithm does correctly find the maximum of 6.\n\nWait, so even though the initial step when i=1 didn't capture a lower product, it still works out because in the next steps the negatives flip.\n\nSo perhaps the algorithm is correct.\n\nLet me try another example where the maximum product is in a longer subarray with negatives.\n\nExample: [2, -3, 1, 2].\n\nPossible products: Let's see:\n\nSubarrays:\n\n[2] \u21922,\n\n[2,-3] \u2192-6,\n\n[2,-3,1] \u2192-6*1=-6,\n\n[2,-3,1,2] \u2192-6*2=-12,\n\n[-3] \u2192-3,\n\n[-3,1] \u2192-3,\n\n[-3,1,2] \u2192-6,\n\n[1] \u21921,\n\n[1,2] \u21922,\n\n[2] \u21922.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but wait, subarray [1,2] is product 2, and [2] is 2, [2,-3,1,2] is -12, [2,-3] is -6, so the maximum is 2.\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\nInitialize current_max and min as 2. global_max=2.\n\ni=1: num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, 2*(-3)=-6, 2*(-3)=-6) \u2192max(-3, -6, -6)= -3.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -6, -6) \u2192-6.\n\nglobal_max remains 2.\n\ni=2: num=1.\n\ncurrent_max = max(1, (-3)*1=-3, (-6)*1=-6) \u21921.\n\ncurrent_min = min(1, -3, -6) \u2192-6.\n\nglobal_max remains 2.\n\ni=3: num=2.\n\ncurrent_max = max(2, 1*2=2, (-6)*2=-12) \u21922.\n\ncurrent_min = min(2, 2, -12) \u2192-12.\n\nglobal_max remains 2.\n\nSo the algorithm correctly returns 2.\n\nHmm, that's correct.\n\nSo what about an array with a mix of positive and negative, including zeros.\n\nAnother test case: [-1, -2, -3, -4].\n\nIn this case, the maximum product comes from either the last two elements or the first two or something.\n\nWait, let's see: [-1,-2] \u21922, [-2,-3]\u21926, [-3,-4]\u219212, [-2,-3,-4]\u219224, but wait no, it's 2*3*4=24? Wait no: the subarray [-1,-2,-3,-4] has product (-1)*(-2)*(-3)*(-4) = 24.\n\nWait, but that's a positive number. So why do we have the maximum at 24.\n\nWait, processing:\n\nInitialize current_max and min to -1. global_max=-1.\n\ni=1: num=-2.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-2, (-1)*-2=2, (-1)*-2=2) \u21922.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-2, 2,2) \u2192-2.\n\nglobal_max is now 2.\n\ni=2: num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, 2*(-3)=-6, (-2)*-3=6) \u21926.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -6, 6) \u2192-6.\n\nglobal_max is 6.\n\ni=3: num=-4.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-4, 6*(-4)=-24, (-6)*-4=24) \u219224.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-4, -24, 24) \u2192-24.\n\nglobal_max is 24.\n\nSo correct.\n\nOkay, now what about an array like [-2, 1, -3, 4].\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's compute possible subarrays:\n\n[-2] \u2192-2,\n\n[-2,1]\u2192-2,\n\n[-2,1,-3]\u21926,\n\n[-2,1,-3,4]\u219224,\n\n[1] \u21921,\n\n[1,-3] \u2192-3,\n\n[1,-3,4]\u219212,\n\n[-3]\u2192-3,\n\n[-3,4] \u2192-12,\n\n[4]\u21924.\n\nThe maximum product is 24 from the entire array.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\nInitialize current_max and min to -2. global_max=-2.\n\ni=1: num=1.\n\ncurrent_max = max(1, (-2)*1=-2, (-2)*1=-2) \u21921.\n\ncurrent_min = min(1, -2, -2) \u2192-2.\n\nglobal_max becomes max(-2,1)=1.\n\ni=2: num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, (1)*(-3)=-3, (-2)*(-3)=6) \u21926.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -3, 6) \u2192-3.\n\nglobal_max is now 6.\n\ni=3: num=4.\n\ncurrent_max = max(4, 6*4=24, (-3)*4=-12) \u219224.\n\ncurrent_min = min(4, 24, -12) \u2192-12.\n\nglobal_max becomes 24.\n\nSo correct.\n\nWait another edge case: all negative numbers.\n\nLike [-5, -4, -3].\n\nThe maximum product is (-5*-4) =20, or maybe [-4,-3]=12? Wait, no.\n\nWait:\n\nSubarrays:\n\n[-5]\u2192-5,\n\n[-5,-4]\u219220,\n\n[-5,-4,-3]\u219260,\n\n[-4]\u2192-4,\n\n[-4,-3]\u219212,\n\n[-3]\u2192-3.\n\nSo maximum is60.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\ncurrent_max = -5, min =-5, global_max=-5.\n\ni=1: num=-4.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-4, (-5)*-4=20, (-5)*-4=20) \u219220.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-4,20,20) \u2192-4.\n\nglobal_max is 20.\n\ni=2: num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3,20*(-3)=-60, (-4)*-3=12) \u2192max(-3, -60,12)=12.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -60, 12) \u2192-60.\n\nglobal_max becomes max(20,12)=20.\n\nWait, that's not right. The global_max should be 60.\n\nWait what's wrong here. Oh, because the product of the entire array is (-5)*-4*-3= -60? Wait no, wait that's not possible.\n\nWait no: (-5)*(-4)=20, times -3: 20*(-3)=-60. Oh right, so the product of the entire array is -60.\n\nBut that's the minimum.\n\nWait but the maximum in that array is 20, not 60. Because the subarray [-5,-4] is 20, which is higher than the overall product of -60.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait wait, when all numbers are negative, but when you have an even number of negatives, the product becomes positive.\n\nWait, the subarray [-5,-4,-3] has 3 elements (odd) so the product is negative. So the maximum in this case is actually the subarray with two elements: [-5,-4], product 20, or [-4,-3] product 12.\n\nSo in that case, the maximum product is 20.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, global_max becomes 20, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought, I thought [-5,-4,-3] is 60, but that's incorrect because:\n\n(-5)*(-4) =20; 20*(-3) = -60. Oh right, so that's -60, not positive. So the algorithm correctly picks 20.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the algorithm works.\n\nAnother case: empty array? Well, problem says one-dimensional array, so assuming it's non-empty.\n\nWhat about single element? Just that element.\n\nSo for example [5], the function returns 5.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 3, -4, 5].\n\nSubarrays and their products:\n\nBut perhaps the maximum is [1,2,3] \u21926, or [5] \u21925.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\ncurrent_max begins at1. global_max=1.\n\ni=1: num=2.\n\ncurrent_max = max(2, 1*2=2, 1*2=2) \u21922.\n\ncurrent_min is 2. global_max becomes 2.\n\ni=2: num=3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(3,2*3=6, 2*3=6) \u21926.\n\ncurrent_min=6. global_max=6.\n\ni=3: num=-4.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-4, 6*(-4)=-24, 6*(-4)=-24) \u2192-4 is larger than -24 and -24.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-4, -24, -24) \u2192-24.\n\nglobal_max remains 6.\n\ni=4: num=5.\n\ncurrent_max = max(5, (-4)*5=-20, (-24)*5=-120) \u21925.\n\ncurrent_min is min(5, -20, -120) \u2192-120.\n\nglobal_max remains 6.\n\nSo the algorithm returns 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo now, the algorithm seems solid.\n\nThus, the approach is to track current_max and current_min as we iterate through the array, updating them based on the current element and the previous max and min, and also keeping track of the global maximum.\n\nSo the steps for the function are:\n\n1. Initialize current_max, current_min, and global_max to the first element.\n\n2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element:\n\n   a. For each element, compute the possible products: \n\n      - Multiply the current element by previous current_max.\n\n      - Multiply the current element by previous current_min.\n\n      - Also, consider the current element alone (this handles when the previous products might be lower, such as when all are negative or zeros are present).\n\n   b. current_max becomes the maximum of these three possibilities.\n\n   c. current_min becomes the minimum of these three possibilities.\n\n   d. Update global_max if current_max is larger than the current global_max.\n\n3. After processing all elements, return global_max.\n\nSo let me now write the code accordingly.\n\nBut wait: need to handle the case when the array is empty? Probably, but in the function definition, we need to handle empty arrays. Oh, but the problem says \"one-dimensional array of numbers\" so I think we can assume it's non-empty. But perhaps in code, handle if it's empty by raising an error or returning 0? Hmm.\n\nProbably, for the function, let's handle non-empty arrays. So code:\n\ndef max_product(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0  # or raise ValueError(\"Array is empty\")\n\n    current_max = current_min = global_max = nums[0]\n\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        # Compute possible products\n        temp_max = max(num, current_max * num, current_min * num)\n        temp_min = min(num, current_max * num, current_min * num)\n        # Update current_max and current_min for next iteration\n        current_max, current_min = temp_max, temp_min\n        # Update global_max\n        if current_max > global_max:\n            global_max = current_max\n    return global_max\n\nWait, but when the number is negative, the max and min can flip.\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nTesting this code against previous examples:\n\nTest1: [2,3,-1]\n\nmax_product returns 6.\n\nTest2: [-2,-3,-4,-5]\n\nReturns (-2*-3)=6, but no, let's think:\n\nWait, in the array [-2, -3, -4, -5], all are negative. The maximum product is (-2*-3) =6, or (-3*-4)=12, or (-4*-5)=20. Or perhaps [ -3,-4, -5] product is (-3*-4*-5)= -60, which is less than 20.\n\nWait but wait:\n\nIn the array [-2,-3,-4,-5], each pair product increases as the numbers are more negative.\n\nWait but actually, for maximum product in an all-negative array:\n\nIf there's even number of elements, the product is positive and is maximum.\n\nBut when it's odd, the maximum is the product of the two least negative (smallest in magnitude) numbers.\n\nWait for example, in array [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1], which is 5 elements.\n\nThe maximum product is (-5*-4) =20, since the product of three would be -5*-4*-3= -60 which is less than 20.\n\nWait no, wait:\n\nWait [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1] has:\n\nSubarrays with even number of elements:\n\n[-5,-4] \u219220,\n\n[-4,-3] \u219212,\n\n[-3,-2] \u21926,\n\n[-2,-1] \u21922.\n\nSo 20 is the maximum.\n\nThe code would process:\n\ncurrent_max=-5, min=-5, global_max=-5.\n\ni=1, num=-4.\n\ntemp_max = max(-4, (-5*-4)=20, same again \u219220.\n\ntemp_min = min(-4,20,20) \u2192-4.\n\ncurrent_max=20, current_min=-4.\n\nglobal_max=20.\n\ni=2, num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-3, 20*-3=-60, (-4)*-3=12) \u219212.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-3, -60, 12) \u2192-60.\n\nglobal_max remains 20.\n\ni=3, num=-2.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-2, 12*-2=-24, (-60)*-2=120) \u2192120.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-2, -24, 120) \u2192-24.\n\nglobal_max becomes 120.\n\ni=4, num=-1.\n\ncurrent_max = max(-1, 120*-1=-120, (-24)*-1=24) \u219224.\n\ncurrent_min = min(-1, -120, 24) \u2192-120.\n\nglobal_max remains 120.\n\nWait but according to earlier analysis, the maximum product is 20. So why is the code returning 120?\n\nWait, wait, that can't be.\n\nWait the array is [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1].\n\nSubarray [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1] has product (-5)*(-4)*(-3)*(-2)*(-1) = (-5* -4)=20, then 20*-3=-60, then -60*-2=120, then 120*-1= -120. That's the product of the entire array, which is -120, which is less than 20. But wait, where is the 120?\n\nAh, the code is considering the subarray [-3,-2,-1], product is (-3)*(-2)*(-1)=-6. Or [-4,-3,-2,-1], product (-4*-3*-2*-1)=24. But wait, how does the code get 120?\n\nWait in the process when num is -2 (i=3):\n\nprevious current_max is 12, current_min is -60.\n\nSo current_max is max(-2, 12*-2=-24, (-60)*-2=120) \u2192120.\n\nWait which suggests that the subarray is ... how?\n\nWait perhaps starting from a previous min that was -60 (which would be the product of subarrays leading up to previous step), and then multiplying by -2 gives 120.\n\nWait the previous current_min was -60 when processing i=2. That would mean the product of the subarray from somewhere to i=2 is -60. Let's see.\n\nAt i=2, we're processing num=-3.\n\ncurrent_max was 20 (from i=1, num=-4).\n\nSo current_max is 20, current_min is -4.\n\nFor i=2, processing -3:\n\ncurrent_max is max(-3, 20*(-3)=-60, (-4)*(-3)=12) \u219212.\n\ncurrent_min is min(-3, -60, 12) \u2192-60.\n\nSo current_min is -60, which is the product of 20*-3=-60, which is the subarray up to i=2, which is [-5,-4,-3], product is 20*-3=-60.\n\nSo when i=3, processing num=-2:\n\ncurrent_max is max(-2, 12*(-2)=-24, (-60)*-2=120) \u2192120.\n\nThat's the subarray up to i=3, but where is that subarray?\n\nIt's the subarray starting from some point to i=3, with product 120. That would be the product of [-3,-2] \u21926, or perhaps a longer subarray.\n\nWait in the step for i=3:\n\nprevious current_min is -60, which was the product of [-5,-4,-3], and multiply by -2 gives 120. So that subarray is [-5,-4,-3,-2], with product 20 * (-3)*(-2) = 20*6=120.\n\nAh, yes. So the subarray [-5,-4,-3,-2] is product (-5*-4)=20 * (-3*-2)=6 \u219220*6=120.\n\nSo in the array [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1], the subarray up to index 3 (0-based i=3?) is the first four elements, product 20*6=120, which is a valid maximum.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that. But then later, processing the last element (-1) would multiply 120 by -1, making it -120, but as the code is only taking current_max which is 120 before multiplying by -1. So then global_max is 120.\n\nBut when we look back, are there subarrays with product higher than 120?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIn the array [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1], are there any other subarrays?\n\nWait the subarray [-4,-3,-2,-1] has product (-4)*-3=12 *-2= -24 * -1=24. That's 24.\n\nThe subarray [-3,-2,-1] product is -6.\n\nBut the subarray [-5,-4,-3,-2] has product 120.\n\nSo 120 is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, but in this case, yes, the maximum product is 120, achieved by four elements.\n\nSo my earlier analysis was wrong because I thought the maximum was only 20, but in reality, it's 120 when taking four elements.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code seems to handle all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. The approach involves iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each position to efficiently determine the maximum product subarray.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing three variables: `current_max`, `current_min`, and `global_max` to the first element of the array. These variables will help track the maximum product subarray ending at the current position and the overall maximum product found so far.\n2. **Iteration**: For each element in the array starting from the second element:\n   - Compute the potential maximum product ending at the current element by considering three possibilities: the element itself, the product of the element with `current_max`, and the product of the element with `current_min`. This accounts for both positive and negative values, as multiplying a negative number can yield a larger positive product.\n   - Similarly, compute the potential minimum product for the current element to handle cases where the product of negative numbers might result in a large positive product in subsequent steps.\n   - Update `current_max` and `current_min` with the computed values.\n   - Update `global_max` if the current maximum product found is greater than the existing global maximum.\n3. **Edge Handling**: Handle empty arrays by returning 0 or raising an error, depending on requirements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_product(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0  # Assuming default return value for empty array as 0\n    \n    current_max = current_min = global_max = nums[0]\n    \n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        # Calculate potential new max and min\n        temp_max = max(num, current_max * num, current_min * num)\n        temp_min = min(num, current_max * num, current_min * num)\n        \n        # Update current_max and current_min\n        current_max, current_min = temp_max, temp_min\n        \n        # Update global_max if current_max is larger\n        if current_max > global_max:\n            global_max = current_max\n    \n    return global_max\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe algorithm efficiently computes the maximum product of a contiguous subarray by maintaining the current maximum and minimum products ending at each position. This allows the solution to handle negative numbers and zeros effectively, ensuring that all potential subarrays are considered without explicitly checking each one, thus achieving linear time complexity. This approach is optimal and ensures that we find the solution in O(n) time where n is the number of elements in the array.",
