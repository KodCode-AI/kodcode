  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function called str_to_int that converts a string to an integer. The function should handle leading and trailing whitespaces and also ignore any invalid characters. Hmm, let's think about the examples given. \n\nSo, for example, if the input is \"42\", it should return 42. If it's \"   -42\", it should return -42. And if it's \"4193 with words\", it should return 4193. That makes sense. \n\nWait, so the function needs to extract the integer part from the string, ignoring any non-digit characters except for the sign. But wait, what about leading non-digit characters? Like, if the string is \"abc123\", then it should extract 123? Or is it possible that the number can start with letters other than a sign? Looking at the examples, in the third case, it's \"4193 with words\" and it returns 4193, meaning it takes the digits from the beginning until it hits a non-digit. So in the case of \"abc123\", maybe it would extract 123, or perhaps nothing if the string doesn't start with digits. Wait, but in that case, since the function's examples have the numbers at the start, maybe the function is designed to extract the first valid number in the string, and if there's none, return 0 or raise an error?\n\nWait, looking at the function's docstring, the examples all have the numbers at the beginning, even if there are other characters after. So, the function should extract the leading number, ignoring any leading whitespace, then take as many digits (and maybe just one sign) as possible. So how to handle this.\n\nSo, the approach is probably to remove leading whitespaces, then look for an optional sign (+ or -), then digits. Once a non-digit is encountered after that, stop.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Strip the string of leading and trailing whitespace. Wait, but wait. The examples show that trailing characters after the number are ignored, but the stripping in the function's example for \"   -42\" returns -42, which is after stripping leading, but maybe trailing whitespace is also stripped. Or maybe no? Wait, the function is supposed to handle leading/trailing whitespaces. So perhaps any leading or trailing whitespace is removed first.\n\nSo, first, I'll take the input string and strip it of leading and trailing whitespace. So s.strip().\n\nWait, let's test with examples.\n\nCase 1: s = \"42\" \u2192 stripped is \"42\" \u2192 correct.\n\nCase 2: s = \"   -42\" \u2192 stripped is \"-42\" \u2192 correct.\n\nCase3: s = \"4193 with words\" \u2192 stripped is same as s, but we take the leading digits.\n\nWait, no: when we strip, trailing is also removed. So in the third example, the stripped string is \"4193 with words\", but I need to take the digits until the first non-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to strip the string, then iterate through the characters to find the first digit or sign.\n\nAlternatively, I can find the longest possible prefix that forms a valid integer.\n\nBut that might be tricky. So, perhaps I should process the stripped string as follows:\n\nLoop through each character, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe number can start with an optional '+' or '-'.\n\nThen followed by one or more digits.\n\nOnce a non-digit is found after the sign, stop and parse the collected digits as the integer value.\n\nSo, for example, stripped string \"-42abc\" should give -42.\n\nBut how to get that in code.\n\nAnother approach is to use regular expressions. Yes, regular expressions would make this easier. Because we can match the pattern of an optional sign, followed by digits.\n\nThe regex pattern would be something like r'^[+-]?\\d+', which matches an optional '+' or '-', followed by one or more digits, starting from the beginning of the string.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Strip the input string of leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n- Use regex to find the first occurrence of a number pattern at the start.\n\n- If such a pattern is found, extract it as a string and convert to integer.\n\n- If not found, perhaps return 0? Or look for other possibilities, but according to the examples, in the second example, it just processes as usual. But what if no number is found at all, like an empty string or only letters?\n\nWait, the function's examples don't cover that. Looking at the function's example outputs, for \"4193 with words\", it returns 4193, so we need to extract the number at the beginning, ignoring any non-digit characters after.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\n1. Strip the input string s: stripped_s = s.strip()\n\n2. Use re.match to find the first occurrence of [+-]?\\d+.\n\n3. If a match is found, take the matched string, convert to int and return.\n\n4. If no match, perhaps return 0. Or, wait, another scenario: what if the string is empty? Like s is \"   \", then stripped_s is empty, no match; then what to return? Maybe 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.match(r'^[+-]?\\d+', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group())\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, but wait in the first example, the function is supposed to return 42, and in the second, -42. That would work.\n\nTesting \"4193 with words\" stripped is same as the string, the regex matches \"4193\" correctly, returns 4193.\n\nWhat about a string like \"--42\", would the regex match? The pattern is [+-]?, so it would match the first '-', then digits. So it would return -42. Similarly for \"abc42\", the stripped string is \"abc42\", the regex doesn't match at the start, so returns 0. But in the function's examples, it's supposed to ignore any invalid characters, but perhaps the function is designed to capture the first number in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is supposed to process the entire string, ignoring all non-digit characters except the sign. Or perhaps it scans through all the characters, extracting the first digits.\n\nWait, but the function examples don't show that. So perhaps using the regex approach is sufficient.\n\nWait, another test case: what if the string is \"12a34\"? The regex would extract \"12\", correct.\n\nAnother test case: s is \"   hello -42 world\", stripped is \"hello -42 world\". The regex looks at the beginning: does it start with a sign and digits? No, because the string starts with 'hello'. So then, the regex doesn't find a match, and returns 0. But that's incorrect because the actual number is -42. So this approach is flawed.\n\nAh, right! So the initial approach is incorrect. The function should not only look for the number at the very start of the stripped string but find the first occurrence of a sign followed by digits, ignoring any leading non-digit, non-sign characters. Because in the test case where the stripped string is \"hello -42\", the function should extract -42.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the examples, in the third example, \"4193 with words\" \u2192 4193 is correctly extracted. So perhaps leading non-digit, non-sign and non-whitespace are considered as non-numeric, thus making the function extract nothing, but that's not correct because \"hello -42\" has the number in the middle, but according to the function's examples, it's \"4193 with words\", and the function returns 4193. So perhaps any leading non-digit, non-sign characters (that are not whitespace) are ignored, but as soon as a sign is found, along with digits, it stops. Wait, no. Maybe the function is supposed to find the first integer, regardless of where it is in the string, ignoring any leading non-digit characters.\n\nBut in that case, for the string \"abc-123def\", the function should extract -123. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the first occurrence of a pattern like [+-]?\\d+, regardless of their position in the string, but considering that numbers can be preceded by any characters. But then, in the case where the first part is non-digit, but later has a number, like \"helloworld42\", does the function return 42 or 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should extract the leftmost possible number, which might be part of the string after some non-digit characters.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to ignore any leading non-digit characters (except the sign), but extract the longest possible number starting from the first digit or sign.\n\nBut wait, how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLoop through the stripped string until the first digit or sign is found, then collect all digits that follow.\n\nWait, but the sign can only be a '+' or '-' and should be only once, at the beginning.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Strip the input string.\n\n2. Iterate through the stripped string until a '+' or '-' (if any) is found followed by digits, or a digit is found.\n\n3. Once found, capture as many digits as possible, stopping when a non-digit is found.\n\n4. Convert the captured string to integer.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- \"   -42\" \u2192 becomes \"-42\" \u2192 return -42.\n\n- \"4193 with words\" \u2192 capture \"4193\" and return 4193.\n\n- \"hello-42\" \u2192 after stripping, it's \"hello-42\". Now, in the iteration, we look for the first +, - or digit. The string starts with 'h', which is not a digit or sign, so we continue until we hit '-', then check if followed by digits: '4' and '2', so we have \"-42\" and return that.\n\nSimilarly, \"a123bc\" \u2192 would capture \"123\".\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nImplementing this could involve:\n\n- Iterate through each character.\n\n- Look for the first occurrence of a '+' or '-' which is followed by a digit \u2192 that's the start of the number.\n\n- Then collect all the following digits.\n\nAlternatively, if the first occurrence of a digit is found, and no sign preceded it.\n\nSo:\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nfound_sign = False\n\nnumber_str = ''\n\ndigits_started = False\n\nLoop through each char in stripped string:\n\n- if we haven't started collecting digits yet:\n\n   - if char is '+' or '-', set sign (expecting digits next).\n\n   - elif char is a digit: start collecting, set digits_started.\n\n   - else: continue (since not part of number)\n\n- else (already collecting):\n\n   - if char is digit: add to number_str.\n\n   - else: break.\n\nOnce loop is done, if number_str is not empty: convert to int, considering the sign, then return. Else: return 0.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nstripped = \"hello-42\"\n\nLoop:\n\nh \u2192 not sign, not digit. Continue.\n\ne \u2192 same.\n\nl \u2192 same.\n\nl \u2192 same.\n\no \u2192 same.\n\n- \u2192 sign encountered. But need to check if next character is digit.\n\nWait, in the code, perhaps after seeing a sign, look ahead to see if next character is a digit. If so, proceed.\n\nBut in the current moment, we see '-', which could be the sign of the number.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\nLoop until we hit a sign or a digit.\n\nOnce a sign is found, we check the next character.\n\nIf next character is a digit, then we have the sign, and proceed to collect the digits.\n\nIf next is not a digit, perhaps we ignore the sign as it's not part of a number.\n\nAlternatively, after finding a '+' or '-' which is followed by a digit, then we proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting complicated. Using regular expressions could be a better approach but with a pattern that allows any characters before the number, not just at the start.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a regex that searches for [+-]?\\d+ anywhere in the string, then returns the first such match.\n\nWait, but how. Like, find the first occurrence of a substring that starts with an optional '+' or '-', followed by digits.\n\nIn regex, this would be r'([+-]?\\d+)'. But using re.search instead of re.match.\n\nSo, in the function, stripped_s = s.strip(), then match = re.search(r'^[+-]?\\d+', stripped). But no, that would only find matches at the start.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, using re.search(), the pattern can find the match anywhere in the string.\n\nWait, but using ^ in the regex makes it only match at the start. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf I change the regex to r'([+-]?\\d+)' and use re.search(), it will find the first occurrence of an optional + or -, followed by digits.\n\nBut wait, in the string \"hello-42\", re.search will find \"-42\" as a match.\n\nIn the string \"-42hello\", it will find \"-42\".\n\nIn the string \"42\", it finds \"42\".\n\nIn the string \"a123\", it finds '123' which is correct.\n\nBut what about a string like \"++42\"? The regex would match '++42'? No, because '++42' has two '+', which isn't allowed. Wait, the pattern is [+-]? \u2192 which is 0 or 1 occurrence of '+' or '-', followed by digits.\n\nSo, the regex is correct to capture the first sequence of an optional '+' or '-', followed by one or more digits.\n\nSo, the function could be rewritten as:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'^([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, no. Wait, because using ^ in the regex with re.search would still only match from the start. So, the pattern would still require the number to be at the beginning of the string.\n\nNo. Wait, re.search looks for the pattern anywhere in the string, regardless of ^. So, the pattern r'([+-]?\\d+)' would match any such occurrence. So, I think I should not have the ^.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct pattern is r'([+-]?\\d+)'.\n\nWait, but then in the case where there are letters before the number, like \"abc-42\", the regex would find \"-42\".\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut in the case where the string is \"--42\", the regex would match '-42'.\n\nIn the case where the string is more complicated, like \"12ab34\", the regex would find '12'.\n\nSo, yes, using re.search with r'([+-]?\\d+)' would find the first occurrence of a number, which can be a sign followed by digits, regardless of where in the string it appears, but in the stripped string (without leading/trailing spaces). Wait no: let's test: for the string is \"abc-42def\", when stripped, it's \"abc-42def\". Using re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)'), the match is '-42'.\n\nSo, in the function, after stripping, match the first occurrence of a number.\n\nBut what about if the number is preceded by leading non-digit and non-sign characters, but then a \"-\" appears but not as a sign? Like, \"hello-world42\" \u2192 the '-' is in the middle of words, but the function would capture '42' if it's looking for digits.\n\nWait, in the string \"hello-world42\", the regex [+-]?\\d+ would match '42' because it's the first digits, right? Because the '42' is at the end.\n\nSo, let's test: for s = 'hello-world42', stripped_s is same. The regex re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)', stripped_s) finds '42'.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, for s = 'hello -42world', stripped is 'hello -42world'. The regex finds '-42'.\n\nBut in s = 'hello42world', the regex finds '42'.\n\nBut in s = 'hello-42world', the regex would find '-42' as a match?\n\nYes.\n\nWait, let's see: the string is 'hello-42world'.\n\nThe regex r'([+-]?\\d+)' would first find the '-' which is followed by '42' \u2192 so the match is '-42'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for 'h-ello42', the regex would find the 'ello42'? No, wait, let's see: '-ell' is letters, but then '42' is digits. So the regex would look for the first occurrence of + or -, or digits. In this string, the first '-' is at index 1. Then, it's followed by 'e', which is not a digit. So, that '-' is a single character, but followed by non-digit. So the regex doesn't match the '-' as part of a number, but skips and looks for digits.\n\nSo in 'h-ello42', the regex finds '42' as the match.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the regex looks for [+-]? followed by one or more digits. So, in the string 'h-ello42', the first [+-] is '-', but the next character is 'e', which is not a digit. So the [+-]? is present, but then the next must be digits. So in that case, the regex will not match at '-', but will continue searching.\n\nIt then finds '42' at the end, so match is '42'.\n\nSo in that case, the function would return 42.\n\nSo, the function is:\n\n- Strip leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n- Search for the first occurrence of an optional '+' or '-' followed by digits anywhere in the stripped string.\n\n- If found, extract as integer.\n\n- Else, return 0.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'^([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, wait. No, because the pattern with ^ will only match at the beginning of the string. So, in the string \"abc-42\", the ^ makes it only look at the start, so it would not find a match because stripped string starts with 'abc'.\n\nSo, if I remove the ^, it should work.\n\nWait, the correct pattern is '([+-]?\\d+)', and use search without ^. That way, it can find the pattern anywhere in the stripped string.\n\nBut then, is it possible that it captures other numbers in the middle? Let's see.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, but what about the scenario where the string is '4a5'? The regex would match '4' and return 4, but the intended value may be invalid. Or in the case of 'aaa-123bbb', it would capture '-123'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, the issue is whether the function is intended to extract this first occurrence. Looking back at the examples:\n\nIn the third example, it's \"4193 with words\" \u2192 the function returns 4193, which is the beginning of the string.\n\nIn this case, the regex would find '4193' as the first occurrence, correct.\n\nBut now, in a string like \"   -42\", the stripped is \"-42\" \u2192 match is '-42' \u2192 correct.\n\nWhat about a string like \"1234\"? The match is '1234' \u2192 correct.\n\nWhat about \"   5678abc\"? Match is '5678' \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, this seems to handle the examples.\n\nWhat about a string like \"--123\"? So stripped is '--123'. The regex will find '-123', as [+-]? means 0 or 1, so the first '-' is taken, then digits (but after that, perhaps).\n\nWait, no: in the pattern, [+-]? is followed by \\d+, which is one or more digits. So in the string '--123', the first '-' is considered as the sign, then the next '-', which is not a digit. So the regex would match only the first '-' and any digits that follow. But in the string, after the first '- comes another '-', which is not a digit, so does the regex match only the first '-' and nothing else? Because digits must follow the optional sign.\n\nWait, in the string \"--123\", the first '-' is not followed by digits, so it's part of the match? Or not?\n\nWait, let's see: the regex pattern is [+-]? followed by \\d+. So it's looking for a sign followed by one or more digits.\n\nBut in \"--123\", the first '-' is a sign, followed by a '-', which is not a digit. So the pattern [+-]?\\d+ tries to match at the beginning of the string: [+-]? is '-', followed by \\d+.\n\nBut after the '-', comes another '-', which is not a digit, so \\d+ cannot find any digits, so the overall match fails. Then, the regex continues searching. The next possible starting points are the second '-' and '1'.\n\nAt position 1 (second '-'), it tries to match [+-]?\\d+ \u2192 the '-' is considered, then it looks for digits. The next character is '1', which is a digit. So match starts at position 1, the second '-', followed by '123', so the group is '-123', which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the function returns -123.\n\nSo it's correctly handled.\n\nSo with this code, in all cases, it's correctly handling the sign and digits.\n\nBut then, what about a string like \"-a123\"? Wait, stripped is \"-a123\". The regex will find the '-a123'?\n\nWait, the regex looks for [+-]? followed by one or more digits.\n\nAt the beginning, '-', so the [+-]? is matched. The next character is 'a', which is not a digit. So this part of the regex (which is [+-]? followed by \\d+) is not matched. So the regex continues.\n\nNow, the next possible starting position is the 'a', which is not a digit, so it's skipped. Then, we reach '123', which is matched as 123.\n\nSo the function returns 123.\n\nBut wait, the actual string starts with '-', then 'a123' \u2192 so '-' followed by 'a' is not part of a number, but the '123' is a number. So yes, the function returns 123, which is correct.\n\nWait, but what if the string is \"-abc123\", the function would return 123, ignoring the leading '-'. So maybe that's the correct behavior, as the '-' is not immediately followed by digits, so it's considered as part of the number.\n\nSo, the function would extract the first valid number it finds, which may not be the first possible.\n\nAlternatively, some may expect that in cases like \"-abc123\", the number is invalid, but the function as per regex extracts 123.\n\nIn the original function's examples, the function is supposed to handle \"4193 with words\" as 4193, which is correctly handled.\n\nSo with this approach, I think the code is handling all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'^([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait no, because with the ^ in the regex, it only looks at the beginning. So, it won't handle cases where the number is not at the start.\n\nWait, that's a mistake.\n\nWait, in this case, using re.search with pattern '([+-]?\\d+)' would find the first occurrence of this pattern anywhere in the string.\n\nBut the regex pattern in the function is not correct.\n\nWait, no, in the current code, the pattern is ^([+-]?\\d+), so the regex is looking for a number only at the beginning, which is wrong. Because in the case of \"hello-42\", it won't match.\n\nWait, that's correct because in the case of the function, with the ^ in the regex, it would not find any number in the middle of the string.\n\nWait, earlier thought was that with the ^ the regex only looks at the start, which is wrong if the number is in the middle.\n\nSo, I must correct that.\n\nSo, the correct code should use a regex that allows the number to appear anywhere in the string.\n\nThus, removing the ^ in the regex.\n\nSo, the correct code is:\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nBut wait, in the case where the string is empty after stripping, match is None, returns 0.\n\nBut the function's examples do not cover that scenario.\n\nWait, another test case: if the string is \"   \", returns 0.\n\nBut perhaps the function could be documented to return 0 in such cases.\n\nIn summary, the function will extract the first occurrence of a number in the stripped string, considering numbers that start with an optional sign followed by digits. It will find the number no matter where it is in the string (beginning, middle, end) as long as it's the first such occurrence.\n\nTesting this:\n\ns = \"hello -42\" \u2192 returns -42.\n\ns = \"-42\" \u2192 returns -42.\n\ns = \"42\" \u2192 returns 42.\n\ns = \"   -42\" \u2192 stripped to \"-42\" \u2192 returns -42.\n\ns = \"4193 with words\" \u2192 stripped to same, regex finds '4193' \u2192 returns 4193.\n\ns = \"a-123b\" \u2192 returns -123.\n\ns = \"++42\" \u2192 returns +42? No: because the regex would match '+42' at the second + (but wait, let's see).\n\nWait, in \"++42\", the regex would look for [+-]? followed by digits.\n\nSo, the first '+' is the [+-]?, then we need digits. The next character is another '+', which is not a digit, so the \\d+ is not satisfied. So the match would not include the first '+', but continue.\n\nThen, it finds '+42' at the second '+' \u2192 '+' followed by 42 \u2192 match is +42, returns 42? Because int('+42') is 42.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait, let's see: In \"++42\", the regex would find the first [+-]? as the first '+', then expects digits. But the next is '+', which is not a digit. So that match fails.\n\nThen, the regex engine continues. The next possible starting point is the second '+', which is a [+-]. Then, the next characters are '4' and '2', which are digits. So, the match is '+42', which is converted to 42.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as above, without the ^ in the regex.\n\nAnother possible problem: what about numbers with leading zeros?\n\nFor example, s = \"000123\" \u2192 returns 123.\n\nBut that's correct, as leading zeros are ignored in integer conversion.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'^([+-]?[\\d]+)', stripped)\n    if match:\n        return int(match.group(1))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nWait, but in the previous code, the pattern was [0-9]+, but using '\\d+' is more Pythonic.\n\nWait, in actual code, perhaps in the regex, using '\\d+' instead of '\\d+' is better.\n\nWait, but the pattern is '([+-]?\\d+)' \u2192 that's correct.\n\nI think this should cover all cases. So, the final code is:\n\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    return int(match.group()) if match else 0\n\nYes, that's concise.\n\nSo this should handle the cases.\n\nTesting again:\n\nTest case 1: str_to_int(\"42\") \u2192 returns 42.\n\nTest case 2: str_to_int(\"   -42\") \u2192 returns -42.\n\nTest case 3: str_to_int(\"4193 with words\") \u2192 returns 4193.\n\nAnother test case: str_to_int(\"hello -42 world\") \u2192 returns -42.\n\nStripped string is 'hello -42 world' \u2192 the first occurrence is '-42', which is returned.\n\nAnother test case: str_to_int(\"abc123def\") \u2192 returns 123.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnother test case: str_to_int(\"\") \u2192 returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: str_to_int(\"   a1b2c3 \") \u2192 stripped is 'a1b2c3', the first occurrence is '1' \u2192 returns 1.\n\nThus, the function handles all the cases appropriately.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that converts a string to an integer, handling leading and trailing whitespaces, and ignoring any invalid characters. The function should extract the first valid integer it finds in the string, which may include an optional sign followed by digits.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Strip Whitespace**: First, remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string.\n2. **Regular Expression Search**: Use a regular expression to find the first occurrence of a valid integer. The integer can start with an optional '+' or '-', followed by one or more digits.\n3. **Conversion to Integer**: If a valid integer is found, convert it to an integer and return it. If no valid integer is found, return 0.\n\nThe regular expression `r'([+-]?\\d+)'` is used to match any sequence of digits that may optionally start with a '+' or '-'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef str_to_int(s: str) -> int:\n    stripped = s.strip()\n    match = re.search(r'([+-]?\\d+)', stripped)\n    return int(match.group()) if match else 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Stripping Whitespace**: The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string.\n2. **Regular Expression Search**: The `re.search()` function looks for the first occurrence of the pattern `([+-]?\\d+)` in the stripped string. This pattern matches an optional sign followed by one or more digits.\n3. **Conversion and Return**: If a match is found, the matched string is converted to an integer using `int()` and returned. If no match is found, the function returns 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles various edge cases, including strings with no valid integers, strings where the number is not at the beginning, and strings with multiple valid integers (by extracting the first one).",
