  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to determine if a number is a perfect square. Hmm, a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. So, for example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 squared.\n\nFirst, I should think about the steps to check if a number is a perfect square. Let me see.\n\nWell, the simplest method might be to take the square root of the number and then check if that square root is an integer. Because if it is, then the number is a perfect square.\n\nBut wait, how do I do that in Python? Oh right, I can use the math module's sqrt\u6212unction. But wait, the sqrt function returns a float. So I need to check if the square root is an integer. How?\n\nMaybe I can take the integer part of the square root, square it, and see if it equals the original number. That could work.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Take the input number. Let's call it n.\n\n2. Compute the square root of n.\n\n3. Round the square root to the nearest integer. Wait, but sometimes due to floating point precision, we might round incorrectly. So maybe a better approach is to take the integer part using int(), and then check both the integer and the one above to avoid missing due to decimal issues.\n\nWait, perhaps a more precise way is to take the square root, convert it to an integer using int(), and then square it to see if it equals n. But I'm not sure if this will always work because for very large numbers, converting to int might truncate too much.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to round the square root to the nearest integer, both up and down, then check both.\n\nWait, actually, maybe another better method is using binary search to find if the square root is an integer. Because for very large numbers, taking the square root might be computationally expensive or cause overflow issues? Not sure if that matters in Python with its arbitrary precision integers.\n\nBut for the scope of this problem, perhaps the first approach is sufficient. Let me think about the steps again.\n\nLet's say n is 16.\n\nsqrt(16) is 4.0, convert to int is 4. Then 4 squared is 16, which matches, so it is a perfect square.\n\nWhat if n is 15?\n\nsqrt(15) is approx 3.872983346. Convert to int gives 3. 3 squared is 9, which is not 15. So it's not a perfect square.\n\nBut what if n is 25?\n\nsqrt(25) is 5.0, so same process works.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? Because 0 is 0 squared, so it should return True. But if we proceed, sqrt(0) is 0, so (int(sqrt(n)))^2 is 0, which equals n. So that's covered.\n\nBut what about negative numbers? Because the square of an integer cannot be negative, the function should return False if n is negative. So we need to handle that first.\n\nSo, the function can start by checking if n is negative. If it is, return False.\n\nWait, but wait, zero squared is zero, which is allowed. So, in code:\n\nif n < 0:\n    return False\n\nBut then, n=0 is acceptable.\n\nNow, another thing: for numbers that are perfect squares but when you compute sqrt, it's an integer with a .0, so when converted to int, it's correct. But for numbers that aren't perfect squares, it's fine.\n\nBut let's test with a case where n is a perfect square but very large. For example, n = 10567890^2 which is a very large number. Computing sqrt in Python should give an accurate result, but due to floating point limits, it might not. Wait, but in Python, math.sqrt can handle it because Python uses arbitary-precision integers when needed. Wait, no, math.sqrt returns a float, which is a binary floating-point, which can't represent all integers beyond a certain point accurately. So perhaps for very large n, using math.sqrt may not be reliable.\n\nFor example, suppose n is a very large square, but when you compute sqrt(n), it could be just below the actual integer, due to floating-point precision. When you cast it to int, it gives the lower integer, which when squared is less than n, incorrectly indicating it's not a perfect square.\n\nSo, we need a better method.\n\nAlternative approach: Use binary search to find the integer whose square is exactly n.\n\nThat might be more reliable for large numbers.\n\nBut how to implement it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nGiven a number n, find if there exists an integer m such that m*m = n.\n\nSince n can be up to very large numbers, but in Python, even 1e30 is manageable.\n\nBut I think the binary search method is better because it's precise for integers.\n\nSo here's how binary search could work.\n\nSet low to 0 and high to n (since the square root of n can't be larger than n except when n is 0 or 1).\n\nWait, but for n=2, high is 2, but actually, the square root is 1.414, which is 1 as the int.\n\nWait, actually, high can be set to min(n, some upper limit). But n can be as high as we want.\n\nBut perhaps better to set high as n, since the square of high needs to be compared with n.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    mid_squared = mid * mid\n\n    if mid_squared == n:\n        return True\n    elif mid_squared < n:\n        low = mid + 1\n    else:\n        high = mid -1\n\nIf after the loop, we didn't find mid, then return False.\n\nYes, this would work. Because for any perfect square, there's an exact integer mid where mid squared equals n.\n\nBut wait, let me test with some numbers.\n\nTest case 1: n=16\n\nlow=0, high=16.\n\nmid=(0+16)//2=8\n\n8^2=64>16, so high=7.\n\nNext iteration, mid=(0+7)//2=3\n\n3^2=9 <16 \u2192 low=4\n\nmid=(4+7)//2=5 \u2192 25>16 \u2192 high=4.\n\nNow low=4, high=4.\n\nmid=4 \u2192 16=16 \u2192 return True.\n\nTest case 2: n=15.\n\nlow=0, high=15.\n\nmid=7, 49>15 \u2192 high=6.\n\nmid=3 \u21929 <15 \u2192 low=4.\n\nmid=5 \u219225>15 \u2192 high=4.\n\nlow=4, high=4 \u2192 mid=4 \u2192 16>15 \u2192 high=3.\n\nNow low=4>high=3 \u2192 loop ends. Return False.\n\nTest case 3: n=0.\n\nlow=0, high=0.\n\nmid=0 \u2192 0^2=0 \u2192 return True.\n\nTest case 4: n=1 \u2192 return True.\n\nTest case 5: n=2 \u2192 returns False.\n\nThis approach seems solid.\n\nSo, implementing this would prevent errors from floating-point inaccuracies because we're dealing with integers all the way.\n\nSo the function can be structured as:\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    low = 0\n    high = n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        mid_squared = mid * mid\n        if mid_squared == n:\n            return True\n        elif mid_squared < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid -1\n    return False\n\nBut wait, in the case where n is 25:\n\nmid will eventually be 5, return True.\n\nAnother case: n=10567890^2.\n\nAs long as the integer operations are correct, it will return True.\n\nWhat about n=10^18 +1? Let me compute.\n\nHmm, in binary search, it would not find mid where mid^2 is equal to n, thus return False. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems robust.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to compute the integer part of the square root and then check if the square is equal.\n\nBut in Python, to compute the integer square root without using floating points, perhaps using the math.isqrt function, which returns the integer square root.\n\nWait, the math module in Python 3.8+ has isqrt, which returns the floor of the exact square root.\n\nSo, for n >=0, math.isqrt(n) returns the integer m such that m^2 <=n <(m+1)^2.\n\nSo, if you compute m = isqrt(n), and then m*m ==n, then it is a perfect square.\n\nYes, that's another way.\n\nSo the function could be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    m = math.isqrt(n)\n    return m * m == n\n\nThat's much simpler and efficient.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTest case n=16 \u2192 m=4 \u2192 4*4=16 \u2192 True.\n\nn=15 \u2192 m=3 \u2192 9 <15 \u2192 False.\n\nn=0 \u2192 m=0 \u2192 0 \u2192 True.\n\nn=2 \u2192 m=1 \u2192 1 !=2 \u2192 False.\n\nThis should work.\n\nAdditionally, math.isqrt can handle very large integers without floating point errors. So this seems reliable.\n\nThus, the most efficient and clean way is to use math.isqrt and compare its square with the original.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n **2 == n\n\nBut wait, for n=25, sqrt_n is 5 \u2192 25: returns True.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, for numbers where n is not a perfect square, for example, 24 \u2192 isqrt is 4, 4^2=16\u226024.\n\nGreat.\n\nWhat about n=10567890 squared?\n\nSuppose n = (10567890)^2 \u2192 isqrt returns 10567890, whose square is n. So the function will return True.\n\nAnd for the same number plus 1: (10567890)^2 +1 \u2192 isqrt is 10567890, but (10567890)^2 +1 \u2260 (10567890)^2, so returns False.\n\nThus, this method should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the optimal function is to use math.isqrt and check.\n\nTherefore, the code is as above.\n\nBut let me consider for very large n, say, n being a 100-digit number which is a perfect square. The function would still handle it correctly because math.isqrt is precise.\n\nIn comparison, using the binary search approach is more code but perhaps just as efficient, but using math.isqrt is cleaner and more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the Python function can be written using math.isqrt.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that math.isqrt is available. Since it's available from Python 3.8 onwards. So if the environment is Python 3.8+, it's safe.\n\nYes, so the function would be as I wrote.\n\nSo, I think that's the solution.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n\nBut wait, perhaps in the case n=1, isqrt(1) is 1, which squared is 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about n=2: isqrt(2) is 1, returns False.\n\nSo, all test cases are covered.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe function to determine if a number is a perfect square is \\boxed{}.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Check if the number is negative. If it is, return False since perfect squares can't be negative.\n2. Use the `math.isqrt` function to compute the integer square root of the number.\n3. Square the integer obtained from step 2 and check if it equals the original number.\n4. Return True if it does, otherwise return False.\n\nThe Python function is:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{def is_perfect_square(n):} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{if n < 0: return False} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n```\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a number is a \"perfect square\" number, which is an integer that is the square of another integer, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Check for Negative Numbers**: Since perfect squares cannot be negative, return False if the input number is negative.\n2. **Compute Integer Square Root**: Use the `math.isqrt` function to compute the integer square root of the number. This function returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the input number.\n3. **Check for Perfect Square**: Square the integer obtained from the previous step and check if it equals the original number. If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThe Python function implementing these steps is:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe function to determine if a number is a perfect square is provided below:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{def is_perfect_square(n):} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{if n < 0: return False} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)} \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n}\n\\end{aligned}\n}",
