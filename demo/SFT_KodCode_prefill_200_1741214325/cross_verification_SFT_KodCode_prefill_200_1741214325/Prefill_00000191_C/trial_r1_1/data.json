  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to reverse a linked list in place. Hmm, I remember that reversing a linked list is a common problem, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the linked list structure looks like. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node. So if I have a list like 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 ->5, I need to reverse it to 5 ->4 ->3 ->2 ->1.\n\nThe function I'm writing takes the head of the list and returns the new head. So, I need to start at the head and manipulate the pointers.\n\nWait, but when you reverse the linked list, each node's next pointer needs to be changed. So I might need to keep track of the previous node as I go along.\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n1. Initialize three pointers: previous, current, and next. I think previous starts as None, and current is the head.\n\n2. While the current is not null, I do the following:\n   a. Store the next node before changing the next pointer of current.\n   b. Set current's next to previous. This reverses the link.\n   c. Move previous and current one step forward.\n\n3. After the loop, the previous pointer should be at the new head of the reversed list.\n\nWait, that makes sense. But let me try an example.\n\nTake a simple case like 1 -> 2. The reversed should be 2 ->1.\n\nProcess:\nprevious = None, current = head (1)\nLoop step 1:\nnext_node = current.next \u21922\ncurrent.next = previous \u2192 None. So now, 1's next is None.\nThen, previous becomes current \u21921. Current becomes next_node \u21922.\n\nSecond iteration:\nnext_node = current.next \u2192null\ncurrent.next = previous \u21921. So 2's next is 1 now.\nThen, previous becomes 2. Current is None, so loop ends.\n\nSo the new head is previous \u21922. So the reversed list is 2->1. Yep, that works.\n\nLet me try another example. Let's say 1->2->3->4->5.\n\nProcess step by step:\n\nInitial: previous = None, current =1.\n\nLoop:\n\n1. next_node =2, current.next = None. prev=1, current=2.\n2. now current is 2. next_node=3, current.next =1. prev=2, current=3.\n3. next=4, current.next=2 \u21923 now points to 2. prev=3, current=4.\n4. next=5, current.next=3. prev=4, current=5.\n5. next is None, current.next=4 (prev was 4). current becomes None.\n\nLoop ends. prev is 5. So the new head is 5, and it points to 4, which points to 3, etc. So correct.\n\nOkay, so the logic works.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nWhat if the list is empty? Then head is None, and the function returns None, which is correct.\n\nWhat about single node? Then current is not null. previous is None. The next node is None. So current.next becomes previous (None). Then prev and current move, loop ends. So the new head is previous, which was last current, which is the same node. So it's correct.\n\nSo I need to write code that does this.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nI think the function is called reverse_linked_list and takes head as argument.\n\nInside, initialize previous as None, current as head.\n\nThen in a loop while current is not None:\n\nSo:\n\nprev = None\ncurrent = head\nwhile current:\n    next_node = current.next\n    current.next = prev\n    prev = current\n    current = next_node\n\nAt the end, return prev as the new head.\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nNow, let's see the given test cases:\n\nTest 1: head is None \u2192 returns None.\n\nTest 2: head is 1 \u2192 in the loop, current is 1, next_node is None. current.next = None, prev becomes 1, current becomes None. So function returns 1.\n\nTest3: The longer list. As per earlier, the code will handle that.\n\nTest4: two nodes \u2192 same as earlier, works.\n\nSo the code should handle all test cases.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n\nWait, but what about when the head is a single node, or empty?\n\nYes, the code handles it. Because if head is None, current is None, loop doesn't run, and return prev which is None.\n\nSo all test cases are covered.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse a linked list in place. Reversing a linked list means changing the direction of the pointers so that the last node becomes the first node and vice versa. This operation should be performed in place, meaning we should not use any extra space that scales with the input size.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach utilizes three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next_node`. The idea is to traverse the linked list and reverse the pointers of each node. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `previous` set to `None` and `current` set to the head of the linked list.\n2. **Traversal**: While `current` is not `None`, do the following:\n   - Store the next node in `next_node`.\n   - Reverse the `next` pointer of `current` by setting it to `previous`.\n   - Move `previous` and `current` one step forward.\n3. **Completion**: When the loop ends, `previous` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed linked list.\n\nThis approach efficiently reverses the linked list in place with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, x, next=None):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        next_node = current.next\n        current.next = prev\n        prev = current\n        current = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: `prev` is initialized to `None` and `current` to the head of the linked list.\n2. **Loop Through List**: For each node, we first store the next node (as `next_node`), then reverse the link by setting `current.next` to `prev`. After adjusting the pointers, we move `prev` and `current` one step forward.\n3. **Termination**: The loop continues until `current` becomes `None`, indicating we have reached the end of the list. At this point, `prev` holds the head of the reversed list.\n\nThis method ensures that each node's pointer is reversed in place without using extra space, making it both time and space efficient.",
