  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function to reverse a linked list. Hmm, I remember this is a common problem. So, the function is called reverse_linked_list and takes a head as input, which is a ListNode. Right.\n\nLet me think about the structure of a linked list. Each node has a value and a next pointer which points to the next node. To reverse the list, I need to make each node's next point to the previous node instead. But wait, how do I do that without losing the reference to the rest of the list because once I change the next pointer, I can't go back.\n\nMaybe I should use a iterative approach. So, I don't have to use extra space except a few variables. Let me think of the steps.\n\nI'll need three pointers: previous, current, and next. Because when I'm at a current node, I change its next to the previous node. But before that, I need to remember what the next node is.\n\nWait, right. Let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize previous as None.\ncurrent is the head.\nWhile current is not None:\n    next_node = current.next\n    current.next = previous\n    previous = current\n    current = next_node\nAt the end, previous will be the new head.\n\nBut wait, the function is supposed to reverse the list in place. Oh right, manipulating the nodes but not creating new ones.\n\nSo, the function will return the new head, which is 'previous' because when the loop ends, current is None, and previous is the last node, which is the new first node.\n\nLet me think about some test cases.\n\nTest case 1: head is None. Then the function returns None. That makes sense.\n\nTest case 2: head with only one node. The loop runs once. Current is head, next_node is None. Current.next becomes previous (None). So the list is just that single node.\n\nTest case 3: longer list, like 1->2->3->4->5.\n\nLet me simulate the process.\n\nprevious = None\ncurrent = 1\nnext_node = 1.next is 2\ncurrent.next points to None (previous)\nprevious becomes 1\ncurrent moves to 2\n\nNow, next_node is 2.next is 3\ncurrent.next (2) points to previous (1)\nprevious becomes 2\ncurrent moves to 3\n\nContinue this way, each node's next points backward. After all steps, previous will point to the last node, which is 5, which is now the first.\n\nSo yes, this approach should work.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nThe function:\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    # Initialize pointers\n    prev = None\n    curr = head\n    while curr is not None:\n        next_node = curr.next  # save next node\n        curr.next = prev      # reverse the link\n        prev = curr           # move prev forward\n        curr = next_node      # move curr forward\n    # After loop, prev is the new head\n    return prev\n\nThat should do it.\n\nTesting these cases:\n\nFor the third test case, linked list 1->2->3->4->5, after reversing, it should be 5->4->3->2->1.\n\nAnother test case with only two nodes: 1->2. Reversed to 2->1.\n\nYes, I think this should work.\n\nWhat about modifying the linked list in place? Since we're not creating new nodes, just changing pointers, this reverses it in-place, which is good.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse a linked list in place. This means that we will manipulate the pointers of the existing nodes to reverse the order of the list without using extra space for new nodes.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to reverse a linked list involves iterating through the list and changing the pointers of each node to point to the previous node instead of the next node. This is done using three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next_node`.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with `previous` set to `None` and `current` set to the head of the list.\n2. **Iteration**: While `current` is not `None`, do the following:\n   - Save the next node in `next_node`.\n   - Reverse the link of `current` node by setting `current.next` to `previous`.\n   - Move `previous` one step forward.\n   - Move `current` to `next_node`.\n3. **Result**: When the loop ends, `previous` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThis method efficiently reverses the linked list in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes, and uses O(1) extra space.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, x, next=None):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    curr = head\n    while curr is not None:\n        next_node = curr.next\n        curr.next = prev\n        prev = curr\n        curr = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: `prev` is initialized to `None` and `curr` is initialized to the head of the list.\n- **Iteration**: The loop runs until `curr` becomes `None`. In each iteration:\n  - `next_node` stores the next node of the current node.\n  - The `next` pointer of the current node is reversed to point to `prev`.\n  - `prev` is updated to the current node.\n  - `curr` moves to the next node.\n- **Result**: After the loop completes, `prev` points to the head of the reversed linked list.\n\nThis approach ensures that each node's pointers are reversed in place, resulting in an efficient solution with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.",
