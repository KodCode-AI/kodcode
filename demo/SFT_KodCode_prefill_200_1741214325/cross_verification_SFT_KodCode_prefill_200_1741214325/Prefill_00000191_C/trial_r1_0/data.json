  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function to reverse a linked list in place. Hmm, let's think about how linked lists work. Each node has a value and a next pointer pointing to the next node or None at the end.\n\nSo, reversing the linked list means that the last node becomes the first, and so on, until the first becomes the last. But since we're doing it in place, we can't just create a new list; we have to adjust the pointers.\n\nI remember that for reversing a linked list, a common approach is to use three pointers: previous, current, and next. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nInitially, the previous pointer starts as None, and the current pointer starts at the head. Then, for each node, I do the following:\n\n1. Store the next node in a temporary variable because we'll lose the reference once we change current's next.\n2. Reverse the next pointer of the current node to point to the previous.\n3. Move the previous and current pointers one step forward.\n\nThis should work, but I need to think about edge cases. What if the head is None, meaning the list is empty? Oh right, the function should handle that and just return None.\n\nAnother case is when there's only one node; then the reversed list is the same, so we just return the head.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- If the head is None, return None.\n- Initialize previous as None, current as head.\n- While current is not None:\n   - Store next_node = current.next\n   - current.next = previous\n   - previous = current\n   - current = next_node\n- After the loop, previous will be the new head because we've reversed all the links.\n  \nSo the function should return previous as the new head.\n\nWait, let's test this logic with a small example. Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n\nFor the first iteration:\ncurrent is 1, previous is None.\nnext_node is 2.\ncurrent.next becomes None, so list is None <- 1. Now, previous is 1, current is 2.\n\nSecond iteration:\ncurrent is 2, next_node is 3.\ncurrent.next points to previous (1), making it 1 <- 2 <-3. Oh wait, no, because current is 2, and previous is 1. So current.next was 3, but now we set it to 1 after swapping. So the list would be 1 <- 2, and then 3's next is None.\n\nWait, maybe I should walk through each step:\n\nInitially:\nprev = None, curr = head (1)\n\ncurr.next = prev \u2192 1's next is None. Now, list is None.\n\nThen, prev becomes curr (1), curr becomes next_node (2).\n\nNext iteration:\nnext_node is 3.\n\nSet curr.next (which is 2's next) to prev (1). So now, 2's next points to 1.\n\nSo the list is 1 <- 2, but 3 is still pointing to nothing.\n\nWait, that's not right. After two steps:\n\nprev is 1, curr is 2.\n\nIn the loop:\nnext_node = 3.\n\ncurr.next = prev \u2192 2.next =1. So 1 is before 2, but what about 3?\n\nThen prev becomes 2, curr becomes 3.\n\nLoop again: curr is now 3.\n\nnext_node is None.\n\nSo curr.next is set to prev (2). So 3.next points to 2. The list is 3 -> 2 ->1.\n\nAnd prev becomes 3, curr becomes None. So the loop ends.\n\nThe new head is previous, which is 3. So that looks correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work.\n\nNow, code time.\n\nIn Python, I need to handle the head. So:\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    curr = head\n    while curr is not None:\n        next_node = curr.next\n        curr.next = prev\n        prev = curr\n        curr = next_node\n    return prev\n\nAlso, test cases:\n\nTest 1: None \u2192 return None.\n\nTest 2: Only one node. So head is 1, after loop, prev is 1, which is correct.\n\nTest 3: Longer list, 1-2-3-4-5.\n\nThe function reverses it to 5-4-3-2-1.\n\nAnother test case: 1-2, becomes 2-1.\n\nYes.\n\nLooks solid. I think this should handle all cases.\n</think>\n\nTo reverse a linked list in place, we can use a three-pointer approach where we adjust the pointers to reverse the direction of the links between the nodes. This method ensures that we do not require extra space beyond the necessary pointers, making it efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the linked list is empty, return `None`. If it contains only one node, return the same node as reversing a single node list results in the same list.\n2. **Three Pointers Technique**: Use three pointers: `prev` (previous node), `curr` (current node), and `next_node` (next node in the list).\n3. **Reverse Links**: For each node, update its next pointer to point to the previous node. Move the `prev` and `curr` pointers one step forward in each iteration.\n4. **Return the New Head**: After processing all nodes, `prev` will point to the new head of the reversed linked list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    prev = None\n    curr = head\n    while curr is not None:\n        next_node = curr.next\n        curr.next = prev\n        prev = curr\n        curr = next_node\n    return prev\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start with `prev` as `None` and `curr` as the head of the linked list.\n- **Traversal Loop**: While `curr` is not `None`, store the next node in `next_node` before reversing the link of `curr` to point to `prev`.\n- **Update Pointers**: After reversing the link, move `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next_node`.\n- **Result**: The loop completes when all nodes have been processed, and `prev` points to the new head of the reversed linked list.\n\nThis method efficiently reverses the linked list in place with O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes, and O(1) space complexity.",
