  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to check if all elements in an array are unique. Hmm, let's think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, there's a way to check the length of a list. If all elements are unique, then the length of the list should be the same as when we convert it into a set, because sets automatically remove duplicates. That makes sense because a set can't have duplicate elements. So maybe I can compare the length of the original list with the length of the set created from that list.\n\nWait, but what about the time complexity? Using a set is O(n) time, which is efficient. So converting the list to a set and comparing lengths seems efficient. That should work for most cases.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each element and check if any element appears more than once. But that would require a nested loop, which would be O(n^2) time, which isn't as efficient as using a set. So the set method is better.\n\nSo the plan is: take the input list, convert it to a set, and if the lengths are equal, return True; else, return False.\n\nWait, but what about unhashable types? Like if the list contains dictionaries or lists, because those can't be elements of a set. So the function would throw an error if such elements are present. But since the question doesn't specify handling those cases, maybe it's safe to assume that the list contains hashable elements. So the function will work under that assumption.\n\nSo now, writing the code. The function would be called something like all_unique. It takes an array as input. Inside the function, I'll compute the length of the array and the length of the set of the array. Then return if they are equal.\n\nLet me think about the edge cases. If the array is empty, the function should return True because there are no elements to compare. If the array has one element, it should return True as well. For multiple elements, it correctly identifies duplicates.\n\nWhat about when the array has elements that are different in type but same in value, like 1 and '1'? For example, [1, '1'] would be considered unique, which is correct because they are different elements in Python.\n\nSo I'll write the function:\n\ndef all_unique(array):\n    # Convert the array to a set and compare lengths\n    return len(array) == len(set(array))\n\nThat's the function. It's concise but does the job.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might want a more explicit way without using sets, maybe for educational purposes. For example, using a loop and checking each element. But in that case, the function would be less efficient. I think for this problem, the set approach is best.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,3] \u2192 should return True. Using the function, len is 3, set len is 3 \u2192 True.\n\nTest case 2: [1,2,2,3] \u2192 len is 4, set is 3 \u2192 False.\n\nTest case 3: [] \u2192 len is 0, set is 0 \u2192 True.\n\nTest case 4: [1] \u2192 True.\n\nTest case 5: ['a', 'b', 'a'] \u2192 len 3, set size 2 \u2192 False.\n\nAll these cases should work.\n\nI think the code is solid. Let me write it with the comments.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if all elements in an array are unique, we can leverage the properties of sets in Python. A set automatically removes duplicate elements, so if the length of the original array is equal to the length of the set created from the array, all elements are unique.\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef all_unique(array):\n    # Convert the array to a set to remove duplicates\n    # If the lengths are equal, all elements are unique\n    return len(array) == len(set(array))\n```\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```python\nprint(all_unique([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: True\nprint(all_unique([1, 2, 2, 3]))  # Output: False\nprint(all_unique([]))             # Output: True\nprint(all_unique(['a', 'b']))     # Output: True\nprint(all_unique(['a', 'a']))     # Output: False\n```",
