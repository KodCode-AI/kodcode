  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that sorts a list of tuples. The sorting should be based on the second item in each tuple, and if those are the same, then it should sort by the first item. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nI remember that Python's sort function can take a key parameter. So maybe I can use a custom key that returns a tuple of the second item and then the first item. That way, when the second items are equal, the first item will be used to break the tie.\n\nWait, but how does the key work? Oh right, the sorted function will sort based on the key's natural ordering. So if I return (tuple[1], tuple[0]), it should sort first by the second element, then by the first.\n\nSo the function will take a list as input. Let's call it tuples_list. Then I'll return the sorted list using the key I just thought of. The sorted function is what I'll use because it returns a new list and doesn't modify the original.\n\nPutting it all together, the function should be something like:\n\ndef sort_tuples(tuples_list):\n    return sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the function is actually handling all cases. For example, what if the tuples have more than two elements? Well, the key only looks at the first and second elements, so that should be fine.\n\nTesting this, let's say I have tuples like (3, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1). The sorted list should first sort by the second item, so the one with 1 comes first, then the two with 2. Between the two with 2, they should be ordered by the first item, so (1,2) comes before (3,2).\n\nYes, that should work. So the function should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that sorts a list of tuples based on specific criteria. The primary sorting key is the second element of each tuple, and if the second elements are the same, the tuples should be sorted by their first element in ascending order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to sort a list of tuples. Each tuple has at least two elements, and the sorting should be done based on the second element. If multiple tuples have the same second element, we then sort them by their first element.\n2. **Using Built-in Sorting with Custom Key**: Python's `sorted()` function allows us to specify a custom key function using the `key` parameter. This key function will determine the order of the elements.\n3. **Key Function**: The key function will return a tuple where the first element is the second item of the original tuple and the second element is the first item of the original tuple. This ensures that the sorting is done first by the second item and then by the first item if needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef sort_tuples(tuples_list):\n    return sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `sort_tuples` takes one parameter `tuples_list`, which is a list of tuples.\n- **Sorting Mechanism**: The `sorted()` function is used with a custom key specified by a lambda function. This lambda function takes each tuple `x` and returns `(x[1], x[0])`.\n  - `x[1]` refers to the second element of the tuple.\n  - `x[0]` refers to the first element of the tuple.\n- **Sorting Order**: By using `(x[1], x[0])` as the key, we first sort the tuples by their second element in ascending order. If two tuples have the same second element, the sorting then falls back to their first elements, also in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently sorts the list of tuples based on the specified criteria using Python's built-in sorting capabilities, ensuring clarity and correctness.",
