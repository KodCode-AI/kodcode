  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Hmm, let's see... Natural numbers are like 1, 2, 3, and so on, right? So the task is to add up the numbers from 1 to n and return the sum.\n\nFirst, I remember that there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. I think it's something like n multiplied by (n + 1) divided by 2. For example, if n is 5, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, and using the formula, 5*6/2 is 15. So that works. That seems efficient because it's a direct calculation, which would be better than looping, especially for large n.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user wants to see it done with a loop for some reason. But the formula is more efficient, so probably better to use that. Plus, it's O(1) time complexity, which is great.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Define a function called sum_of_natural_numbers.\n2. The function takes one parameter, `n`.\n3. Inside the function, calculate the sum using the formula n * (n + 1) // 2. I'll use integer division to ensure it's an integer.\n\nWhy integer division? Because using / would result in a float, which might not be desired, but since the sum is always an integer, using // is better.\n\nWait, but in Python, if you write 5 * 6 / 2, it's 15.0 if using floating point division, but with //, it'll be 15. So it's safer to use integer division.\n\nSo in the function, compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) // 2.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases. What if n is 0? Then the sum is 0, because there are no numbers to add. So the formula should handle that because 0*1//2 is 0.\n\nWhat if n is 1? Then it returns 1, which is correct.\n\nOkay, so the function should work for n >= 0.\n\nWait, but sometimes n is given as a float or something else. So perhaps we should add a type check? But the question says the function is for the first n natural numbers, so probably expects n to be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can take care of it if someone passes a float by converting n to an integer. But perhaps that's beyond the scope. The problem says n is the number, so it's up to the function to handle cases where n is a positive integer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check if n is a positive integer or zero. But since the function is supposed to take n as a parameter, perhaps assume that it's an integer.\n\nSo what are the steps in writing the function?\n\n1. Define the function with parameter n.\n2. Compute sum using (n * (n + 1)) // 2.\n3. Return the sum.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use a loop, you could initialize a variable to 0, loop from 1 to n inclusive, adding each number to the variable, then return it.\n\nBut which is better? The formula is more efficient, so that's better.\n\nSo writing the function with the formula is straightforward.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nWait, but wait, what if someone enters a negative n? Because natural numbers are positive. So maybe the function should return 0 for negative n or raise an error?\n\nHmmm, the problem says it's for the first n natural numbers. If n is 0, some people might consider sum as 0. If n is negative, maybe return 0 or handle it.\n\nSo maybe the function should handle cases where n is less than 1.\n\nIn that case, we can add a condition that if n < 1, return 0.\n\nSo modified function:\n\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nBecause for n = 0 or negative numbers, the sum of the first n natural numbers doesn't make sense, so return 0.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that n should be a positive integer, so perhaps the function should raise a ValueError if n is negative. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe just return 0 for n <= 0.\n\nSo putting it all together, the function will check if n is less than 1, if so, return 0, else compute using the formula.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. It handles all cases: when n is 0, positive, or negative.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n\nTesting this function:\n\nTest case 1: n=5. Should return 15. Compute 5*6//2=15. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: n=1. Returns 1.\n\nTest case 3: n=0. Returns 0.\n\nTest case 4: n=-3. Returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=10. Expected sum is 55. Let's see, 10*11=110, divided by 2 is 55. Correct.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAlternatively, if using a loop, we could write:\n\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += i\n    return total\n\nBut that's more code and less efficient. So the formula is better.\n\nSo in conclusion, the function should use the formula method, handle n less than 1, and return 0 in that case.\n\nYeah, I think that's the best approach.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use a mathematical formula which is efficient and runs in constant time, O(1).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Problem Understanding:**\n   - Natural numbers are positive integers starting from 1.\n   - The task is to compute the sum of these numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight:**\n   - The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n   - This formula provides a direct computation without the need for loops, making it efficient.\n\n3. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0 or a negative number, the sum of natural numbers is defined as 0.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Define a function `sum_of_natural_numbers(n)` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - Check if `n` is less than 1, in which case return 0.\n   - Otherwise, compute the sum using the formula and return the result.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- `sum_of_natural_numbers(5)` should return `15` because \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\).\n- `sum_of_natural_numbers(1)` returns `1`.\n- `sum_of_natural_numbers(0)` returns `0`.\n- `sum_of_natural_numbers(-3)` returns `0`.",
