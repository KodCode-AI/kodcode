  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called reverse_string which takes a string s and returns it reversed. But the catch is I can't use extra space. Hmm, so I can't just create a new string or a list that stores the reversed characters because that would be using extra space, right?\n\nWait, what about modifying the string in place? But Python strings are immutable, meaning I can't change them once they're created. Oh right, so that approach won't work. So I need to think of another way.\n\nHmm, maybe the simplest approach, even if it uses some extra space, but perhaps the problem allows it because it's minimal? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the function is supposed to reverse a string without using extra space. So I can't use any additional memory beyond a few variables.\n\nSo, how can I reverse a string in Python without extra space? Oh, wait, the string is immutable, so any reversal method that creates a new string is actually creating a new object, but perhaps the problem expects us to do it without using significant extra data structures beyond maybe a couple of variables.\n\nAlright, one way to reverse a string is by slicing. Like s[::-1], which creates a reversed copy. But does that count as using extra space? Well, it does create a new string, so technically, it uses O(n) space where n is the length of the string. But the problem says not to use extra space, implying using O(1) space? Or maybe it's acceptable because it's just a concise way.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again. Oh, the sample tests include multi-character strings, empty, single, and even ones with special characters. So the function needs to handle all these cases.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is as simple as returning s[::-1]. That seems to be the simplest way without explicitly creating any loops or additional data structures.\n\nWait, but the problem says without using extra space. The slicing approach does create a new string, which is O(n) space. Does that violate the condition?\n\nHmm, maybe the problem expects an implementation that manually reverses the string without creating a new one. But since Python strings are immutable, that's not possible. We have to create a new string, which would inherently use extra space. So perhaps some leniency is given here, and the slicing method is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is allowed to use the slice because that's the cleanest solution, even though it technically uses O(n) space.\n\nLooking at the test cases:\n\nreverse_string(\"hello\") should return 'olleh' \u2014 which slicing would handle.\nSame for the other cases: empty string stays empty, single character remains same, multiple spaces, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is just a one-liner using slicing.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, when the input is 'hello, world!', the reversed string will be '!dlrow ,olleh', which the slicing handles correctly.\n\nAnother test case is \"!@#\", which should become '#@!', which also works.\n\nSo maybe the problem is expecting the slicing method, despite the extra space, or perhaps because it's considered negligible, or maybe the problem statement is a bit lenient.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\nreturn s[::-1]\n\nThat's concise and fits all test cases.\n\nI think that's the approach. So, let's write the function this way.\n\nLet me test this in my mind.\n\nFor 'hello', slicing gives 'olleh' \u2014 correct.\nFor an empty string, returns '' \u2014 correct.\nFor 'a', returns 'a' \u2014 correct.\nFor three spaces, returns three spaces \u2014 correct.\nFor 'hello, world!', it reverses the entire string including the space and the comma \u2014 correct.\n\nSo this approach works for all the given samples.\n\nSo then the implementation is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse a given string without using extra space. The solution should handle various edge cases, including empty strings, single characters, and strings with special characters.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using Python's string slicing feature to reverse the string in a concise and efficient manner. String slicing in Python allows us to create a new string that is a reversed version of the input string. While this method does create a new string, it is the most straightforward and efficient way to achieve the desired result without explicitly creating additional data structures.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Returns the reversed string of the input s \"\"\"\n    return s[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Slicing**: The function uses the slicing technique `s[::-1]`, which starts from the end of the string and moves backwards. This effectively reverses the string.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The slicing method inherently handles edge cases such as empty strings, single characters, and strings with spaces or special characters without any additional code.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string, as it involves creating a single new string which is the reverse of the input.\n\nThis approach is both clean and efficient, making it suitable for all given test cases and edge scenarios.",
