  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a recursive function called factorial that takes an integer n and returns its factorial. Hmm, but I should also handle cases where n is negative by raising a ValueError. Right, so first, let's think about what factorial is. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers up to n. Like, factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 which is 120. And factorial of 0 or 1 is 1, right?\n\nSo, the base cases for the recursion would be when n is 0 or 1. In those cases, the function just returns 1. But if n is negative, I need to raise ValueError, because factorial isn't defined for negative numbers.\n\nNow, since it's a recursive function, the idea is that factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1). So each step calls factorial with n-1 until it hits the base case.\n\nSo putting it together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if n is negative. If yes, raise ValueError.\n2. If n is 0 or 1, return 1.\n3. Otherwise, return n multiplied by factorial(n-1).\n\nLet me sketch the code structure. The function is defined as def factorial(n: int) -> int:. So:\n\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Negative input\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nWait, wait. But wait, should I include the exception message? The problem statement says to raise ValueError if the input is negative. So, the condition is, if n is less than zero, raise ValueError. But for code purposes, I should also include a message maybe. Or does it matter? Oh, perhaps better to include a message for clarity.\n\nWait, but the problem description says the function should raise ValueError when the input is negative, but the actual code doesn't have any exception handling yet. Oh wait, so I need to include that condition.\n\nWait, but what about for n=0? Because 0 is acceptable, and the base case returns 1. So, the code handles that.\n\nTesting some cases:\n\nfactorial(5) should return 120. Let's see step by step:\n\nfactorial(5) calls 5 * factorial(4)\nWhich is 5*(4*factorial(3))\nAnd so on until factorial(1) returns 1.\n\nBecause 5 *4*3*2*1 =120.\n\nAnother test: factorial(0) should return 1. Makes sense.\n\nWhat if n is, say, 2? Factorial is 2*1=2. Correct.\n\nWhat about if someone calls factorial(-1)? The first condition catches that and raises ValueError. So that should work.\n\nI think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a number \\( n \\) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \\( n \\). The function should handle both positive integers and zero correctly, and it should raise an error for negative inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Base Cases**: \n   - If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1. This is because \\( 0! = 1 \\) and \\( 1! = 1 \\).\n2. **Recursive Case**:\n   - For any integer \\( n \\) greater than 1, the factorial can be calculated as \\( n \\times \\text{factorial}(n-1) \\). This is the recursive step where the function calls itself with a decremented value of \\( n \\) until it reaches one of the base cases.\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the input \\( n \\) is a negative integer, the function raises a `ValueError` since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number whose factorial is to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The function starts by checking if the input \\( n \\) is negative. If it is, the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\n- If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, as these are the base cases for factorial calculation.\n- For \\( n \\) greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively with the argument \\( n-1 \\) and multiplies the result by \\( n \\). This recursion continues until it reaches the base case, at which point the recursion unwinds and the product is computed step by step.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function correctly handles both valid inputs and edge cases, providing the correct factorial value or raising an error as needed.",
