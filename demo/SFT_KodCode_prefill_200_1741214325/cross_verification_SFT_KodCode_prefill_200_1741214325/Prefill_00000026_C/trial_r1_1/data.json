  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called factorial that takes an integer n and returns its factorial. And it should use recursion. Hmm, right. Let me think about recursion first. Recursion is when a function calls itself with a modified parameter until it reaches a base case.\n\nWait, what's the base case for factorial? Oh right, factorial of 0 is 1, and factorial of 1 is also 1. So for n=0 or n=1, the function should return 1.\n\nSo my function should check if n is 0 or 1. If so, return 1. Otherwise, it should call itself with n-1 and multiply that by n.\n\nBut wait, I also need to handle negative numbers. The function should raise a ValueError if n is negative. So before doing anything else, I should check if n is less than 0, and if so, raise ValueError.\n\nSo the steps for the function are:\n\n1. Check if n is less than 0: if yes, raise ValueError.\n2. Else, if n is 0 or 1: return 1.\n3. Else, return n multiplied by factorial(n-1).\n\nLet me think about the code structure. The function is defined as def factorial(n: int) -> int:.\n\nFirst line inside the function: if n < 0, raise ValueError(\"Negative values are not allowed\" or something). Well, the error message isn't specified, but the type is ValueError.\n\nThen, the base case: if n == 0 or n ==1: return 1.\n\nOtherwise, return n * factorial(n-1).\n\nWait, what if someone calls factorial with a non-integer n? But the type hint is int, so maybe the function will only accept integers. But I think the problem states that n is an integer, so perhaps we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo now, coding this.\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let's see.\n\nTesting factorial(5).\n\nfactorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)\nfactorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)\nfactorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)\nfactorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)\nfactorial(1) = 1\nSo 5 *4! = 5*24=120, which is correct.\n\nWhat about n=0: returns 1, which is correct.\n\nWhat about negative? Say n=-3: raises ValueError, correct.\n\nWhat about n=1: returns 1, correct.\n\nSo that's good.\n\nSo I think this code should work. I should make sure all tests pass.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. The factorial of a number \\( n \\), denoted as \\( n! \\), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \\( n \\). \n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using recursion, which is a technique where a function calls itself with a modified parameter until it reaches a base case. The base case for the factorial function is when the input number \\( n \\) is either 0 or 1, where the factorial is defined to be 1.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach:\n1. **Check for Negative Input**: If the input number \\( n \\) is negative, raise a `ValueError` as factorial is only defined for non-negative integers.\n2. **Base Case**: If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, return 1 directly since the factorial of both 0 and 1 is 1.\n3. **Recursive Case**: For any other value of \\( n \\), recursively call the factorial function with \\( n-1 \\) and multiply the result by \\( n \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that the function correctly computes the factorial using the properties of recursive function calls.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input number whose factorial is to be calculated.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the input number.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Negative values are not allowed\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Negative Check**: The function first checks if \\( n \\) is negative. If so, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.\n- **Base Case Handling**: If \\( n \\) is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 immediately as these are the base cases for factorial calculation.\n- **Recursive Multiplication**: For any positive integer \\( n \\) greater than 1, the function calls itself with \\( n-1 \\) and multiplies the result by \\( n \\). This recursive step breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.\n\nThis recursive approach efficiently computes the factorial by leveraging the multiplicative property of factorials, ensuring that each step is simple and straightforward.",
