  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to understand how to test the print_numbers function. The function is supposed to iterate over a list of integers and print each number. Testing a function that prints output might be tricky because it doesn't return anything. So I can't just check the return value. Hmm, how can I capture the printed output for testing purposes?\n\nI remember there are ways to redirect stdout in Python. Oh right! Using the contextlib.redirect_stdout context manager might work. So I can create a StringIO object to capture the output, then redirect the print statements to that.\n\nLet me think about the first test case where I pass [1,2,3,4,5]. I expect each number to be printed on a new line. So after capturing, the result should be a string with those numbers separated by newlines.\n\nWait, what's the data type of the output? Oh right, after capture, I have to split the string by newlines to compare each element. So the captured \u8f93\u51fa should be a single string. For the list with numbers, it should be something like '1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5'. When I split on '\\n' I should get ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'].\n\nSo for test_print_numbers, I can do:\n- Create a StringIO, redirect stdout, call print_numbers with the list.\n- Capture the output, strip any whitespace, then split into lines.\n- Assert that the resulting list equals ['1','2','3','4','5'].\n\nFor the second test case, an empty list, the function should print nothing. So the captured output would be an empty string. So I can assert that the output.strip() is equal to ''.\n\nWait, but what about if there are other whitespace characters? Probably not, since printing each number would give '1\\n2...' etc. So stripping is a good idea.\n\nAnother thing to consider is case sensitivity or leading/trailing spaces, but the function as written shouldn't have those since print(num) just prints the string representation of the number followed by a newline.\n\nSo the test functions should handle these cases correctly. I'll write them as separate functions with appropriate assertions.\n</think>\n\nTo test the `print_numbers` function, we need to capture the standard output (stdout) and assert that it matches the expected printed values. The function doesn't return a value, so capturing the printed output is necessary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Redirection of stdout**: Use the `contextlib.redirect_stdout` context manager to redirect the printed output to a `StringIO` object.\n2. **Test with a List of Numbers**: Test the function with a list containing integers to ensure each number is printed on a new line.\n3. **Test with an Empty List**: Verify that no output is produced when an empty list is passed.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport io\nimport contextlib\n\ndef print_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> None:\n    \"\"\" Iterates over a list and prints each number. \"\"\"\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(num)\n\ndef test_print_numbers():\n    captured_output = io.StringIO()\n    with contextlib.redirect_stdout(captured_output):\n        print_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    output = captured_output.getvalue().strip().split('\\n')\n    assert output == ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\n\ndef test_print_numbers_with_empty_list():\n    captured_output = io.StringIO()\n    with contextlib.redirect_stdout(captured_output):\n        print_numbers([])\n    output = captured_output.getvalue().strip()\n    assert output == ''\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Redirection of stdout**: The `contextlib.redirect_stdout` context manager redirects all print statements within its block to a specified `io.StringIO` object. This allows us to capture the output as a string.\n2. **Testing with Numbers**: The `test_print_numbers` function captures the output of `print_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, converts the captured string into a list of lines, and asserts that it matches the expected list of strings `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.\n3. **Testing with Empty List**: The `test_print_numbers_with_empty_list` function checks that passing an empty list to `print_numbers` results in no output by asserting that the captured output is an empty string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately test the behavior of the function in different scenarios, including typical and edge cases.",
