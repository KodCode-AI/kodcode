  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function to find the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an M x N grid. The only allowed moves are right or down at any point. The grid can be as large as 10x10, so the function should be efficient, and I should use memoization to optimize it. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic dynamic programming problem. The basic idea is that the number of paths to each cell can be determined by the sum of the number of paths reaching the cell above it and the cell to the left of it. Because from those two cells, you can only move down or right into the current cell.\n\nSo, if I think about the grid, the top-left corner (let's say [0,0]) has only 1 path, which is staying there. Similarly, the first row and the first column all have only 1 path each because you can't move up or left from there, so you can only go straight right or down.\n\nBut calculating this recursively without memoization would be inefficient, especially for larger grids. Each cell would be recalculated multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity. That's where memoization comes in. By storing the results of previously computed cells, we can avoid redundant calculations and make the function much faster.\n\nSo I should create a memoization table, maybe a 2D list where each entry at (i,j) holds the number of paths to that cell. I'll start by initializing this table with all zeros, and then fill it up based on the rules.\n\nLet me sketch the algorithm steps:\n\n1. Create a memo table of size M x N, initialized to zero.\n2. The starting point (0,0) has 1 path, so memo[0][0] = 1.\n3. For each cell (i,j), if it's not the starting point, calculate the number of paths as the sum of the cell above (i-1,j) and the cell to the left (i,j-1).\n4. To do this, I can iterate through the grid either row-wise or column-wise. I think row-wise makes sense. For each row i from 0 to M-1, and for each column j from 0 to N-1, if it's the starting cell, leave it as 1. Else, sum the top and left cells.\n\nWait, but the grid indexing\u2014should it be (row, column) or (i,j)? I'll stick with row and column, where M is the number of rows and N the number of columns.\n\nWait, actually, in programming, it's often (row, column) where [0][0] is top-left. So when moving down, row increases, and moving right, column increases. So for an M x N grid, (M-1) is the last row, (N-1) is the last column.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes grid problems are represented as (i,j) where i is the row index and j is the column. Anyway, I'll make it consistent in the function.\n\nNow, thinking about base cases: The first row (i=0) can only be reached by moving right all the way, so each cell in the first row has 1 path. Similarly, the first column (j=0) can only be reached by moving down, so each cell in the first column also has 1 path.\n\nSo, for i in 0 to M-1:\n    for j in 0 to N-1:\n        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = 1\n        elif i == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1]\n        elif j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j]\n        else:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] + memo[i][j-1]\n\nYes, that makes sense. So this can be implemented iteratively. But since the function is in Python, perhaps the recursive approach with memoization is also possible, but for grid sizes up to 10x10, the iterative approach is efficient as well. Hmm, which approach should I take?\n\nThe user specifically mentioned using memoization. So I think they might expect a recursive solution with memoization rather than an iterative DP approach. Let me think.\n\nIn recursive approach, the counts are built by making two recursive calls: one to the cell above and one to the cell to the left. Each path to the current cell is a sum of the two.\n\nBut without memoization, this is like recalculating counts multiple times, resulting in exponential time. So using a memoization decorator or a memo table is necessary.\n\nIn Python, one way to do memoization is to use a dictionary to store results of previously computed cells. So maybe I can create a helper function that takes (i,j) and memoizes the results.\n\nBut wait, the problem is, for each cell, we have a choice to go right or down, but thinking recursively, starting from (0,0) and trying to reach (M-1,N-1), each step can go right or down. The number of paths is the number of ways to arrange right and down moves. That's another way to think about it, combinatorially.\n\nWait, right, actually, instead of dynamic programming, the number of paths is just the binomial coefficient (M+N-2 choose M-1) or equivalently (M+N-2 choose N-1). Because you have to make exactly (M-1) down moves and (N-1) right moves, in any order. So the total number of paths is ( (M-1 + N-1) )! / ( (M-1)! (N-1)! ) )\n\nBut if I use this combinatorial approach, I can calculate it directly without recursion or memoization, which might be more efficient for larger grids. However, for 10x10 grids, it's manageable with DP as well.\n\nBut the problem says to use memoization. So probably they expect the recursive DP approach with memoization.\n\nBut let me reconsider: Let's outline both methods.\n\nCombinatorial approach: Calculate C(M+N-2, M-1). But it's math based.\n\nMemoization approach: Using recursion to count paths to (M-1, N-1) by summing paths to (i-1,j) and (i,j-1), with memoization.\n\nSo, let's consider implementing the recursive approach with memoization.\n\nThus, I need a function, let's say, count_paths(i,j, memo), where i and j are the current position, and memo is a dictionary that holds the number of paths to positions we've already computed.\n\nWait, but for a grid of size M x N, the function will be called starting from (0,0). So the helper function will compute the number of paths to (i,j) and memoize it.\n\nBut actually, since the function is supposed to give the number of paths from top-left to bottom-right, which is from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1). So perhaps, the helper function is more naturally starting from (i,j) and moving towards the destination, but that's a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, starting from the end is another way.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. If I'm at (i,j), the number of paths to the end is equal to the number of paths from (i+1,j) plus the number of paths from (i,j+1). But to avoid index issues, maybe it's better to think in the forward direction, from (0,0) moving right or down.\n\nSo, for position (i,j), if it's the bottom-right corner (M-1, N-1), the number of paths is 1. Else, you can move right or down, provided you don't go beyond the grid.\n\nSo, for the recursive function, each call will:\n\n1. Check if (i,j) is the destination: return 1\n2. Check if (i,j) has been memoized: return memo[(i,j)]\n3. Else, compute the number of paths by going right and going down, then memoize the result.\n\nBut wait, the problem is, when starting from (0,0), but in the recursive approach, thinking from the current cell, you can go to right or down. But the memoization should store the number of paths from (i,j) to the end.\n\nSo, in this case, the base case is when (i,j) is the destination: return 1. Otherwise, compute sum of right and down.\n\nWait, that actually might be flip-flopped from what's expected because, in the standard problem, we start from the top-left and accumulate as we go. So, if I reorient the problem as starting from each cell and thinking about how many ways to reach the end, the recursion is:\n\npaths(i,j) = 0 if i >= M or j >= N\n            else if i == M-1 and j == N-1: 1\n            else: paths(i+1,j) + paths(i,j+1)\n\nBut if i+1 would go beyond M, or j+1 beyond N, then those paths are 0.\n\nThis way, starting from (0,0), we recursively compute the number of paths.\n\nBut without memoization, this would be O(2^(M+N)), which is still way too slow for 10x10, but manageable since 10+10=20, 2^20 is about a million, which is okay, but perhaps for larger grids, it's not great.\n\nBut wait, 10x10 has 100 cells, each with two options, but even that, (M + N) choose M, which for 10x10 is 184756, so it's feasible.\n\nBut the problem wants to handle grids up to 10x10, so using memoization is important.\n\nSo in Python, perhaps using lru_cache decorator or a memo dictionary.\n\nBut the function is supposed to be called for M,N grid, so how to handle that.\n\nWait, perhaps the outer function can take M and N, set up the memoization, and then call the helper function starting from (0,0).\n\nBut in Python, using lru_cache is more straightforward, but we need to make sure that the parameters are hashable.\n\nWait, but M and N can be up to 10, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since we are using a grid-based approach, perhaps the initial approach of tabulation is better: build up the solution iteratively, which is O(M*N) time.\n\nWait, the user requested using memoization to optimize, but using the iterative DP approach uses a table, which is similar to memoization but in a tabular way. So perhaps, the tabular approach is acceptable.\n\nIn the iterative DP approach, for each cell, we calculate based on previous cells, so the time complexity is O(M*N), which is very efficient.\n\nBut since the user specifically asked for memoization, perhaps they expected a recursive solution using memoization to cache results.\n\nHowever, in Python, a recursive solution with memoization could hit recursion depth issues. For grids of size 10x10, the maximum recursion depth is 10 (if moving either right or down step by step), which is within Python's default recursion depth (which is in the thousands). So perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut in any case, the iterative solution is more efficient, so perhaps that's better.\n\nWait, the problem says to handle grids as large as 10x10 efficiently, and asks for memoization. But the combinatorial approach is O(1) after computing factorials, but if we don't precompute factorials, the computation could involve multiplications and divisions, which might be a bit involved, but it's the most efficient way for all sizes, even beyond 10x10.\n\nWait, the number of paths is given by binomial coefficient C(M+N-2, M-1). So for a grid of size M (rows) and N (columns), the number of paths is (M+N-2 choose min(M-1, N-1)).\n\nSo, for example, for a 2x2 grid, it's (2 choose 1) = 2. For a 3x3 grid, (4 choose 2) = 6, etc.\n\nSo if I can compute this binomial coefficient, I can get the result directly without any recursion or looping. But the user wants the solution to use memoization, which would be more aligned with a dynamic programming approach rather than a mathematical formula.\n\nSo perhaps the intent is to use DP with memoization. Therefore, I think it's better to implement the DP approach.\n\nSo, to proceed, I'll write an iterative DP solution.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nDefine a function count_paths(M, N).\n\nCreate a memo table, which is a 2D list of size M x N. Initialize all values to 0.\n\nSet memo[0][0] = 1.\n\nFor i from 0 to M-1:\n    for j from 0 to N-1:\n        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = 1\n        elif i == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1]\n        elif j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j]\n        else:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] + memo[i][j-1]\n\nBut wait, if i and j start from 0, for each cell, if it's on the first row, it's sum is left cell, and same for first column.\n\nBut in code, need to handle the loops correctly.\n\nWait, possibly:\n\nInitialize memo as a 2D array with M rows and N columns.\n\nFor i from 0 to M-1:\n    for j from 0 to N-1:\n        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = 1\n        elif i == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1]\n        elif j == 0:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j]\n        else:\n            memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] + memo[i][j-1]\n\nThen, return memo[M-1][N-1]\n\nYes, that's the standard iterative approach.\n\nBut in Python, I need to create the memo table. For space efficiency, maybe I can use a rolling array, but since M and N are up to 10, it's not a big deal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for space optimization, we can use just two rows since when computing row i, we only need row i-1. But for such small grids, the space is negligible.\n\nBut since the code is straightforward, just write it with a 2D list.\n\nSo, coding:\n\ndef count_paths(M, N):\n    # Create a memo table of size M x N\n    memo = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(M)]\n    \n    # Base case: starting cell has one path\n    memo[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(M):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue  # already set\n            if i == 0:\n                memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1]\n            elif j == 0:\n                memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j]\n            else:\n                memo[i][j] = memo[i-1][j] + memo[i][j-1]\n                \n    return memo[M-1][N-1]\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nWait, but if M or N is 1? For example, if the grid is 1x1, then the answer is 1. If it's 1xN, the answer is 1. Similarly, 1xN is same as N x 1: only 1 path.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nFor M=2, N=2:\n\nmemo is 2x2\n\nmemo[0][0] = 1\n\ni=0, j=0: skip\n\ni=0, j=1: i==0, memo[0][1] = memo[0][0] =1\n\ni=1, j=0: j==0, memo[1][0]=memo[0][0]=1\n\ni=1, j=1: memo[1][1] = memo[0][1] + memo[1][0] = 1 + 1 = 2. So the function returns 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, M=3, N=3:\n\nThe number of paths is 6. The code should compute 6.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize memo[3][3], each cell 0.\n\nmemo[0][0] =1.\n\ni=0, j=0: skip\n\ni=0, j=1: memo[0][1] = memo[0][0] =1\n\ni=0, j=2: memo[0][2] = memo[0][1]=1\n\ni=1, j=0: memo[1][0] = memo[0][0]=1\n\ni=1, j=1: memo[1][1] = memo[0][1] + memo[1][0] = 1+1=2\n\ni=1, j=2: memo[1][2] = memo[0][2] + memo[1][1] =1+2=3\n\ni=2, j=0: memo[2][0] = memo[1][0] =1\n\ni=2, j=1: memo[2][1] = memo[1][1] + memo[2][0] =2 +1=3\n\ni=2, j=2: memo[2][2] = memo[1][2] + memo[2][1] =3 +3=6\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nAlternatively, the recursive approach with memoization:\n\nIn this case, define a helper function with @lru_cache(maxsize=None), but we need to pass M, N as part of the parameters.\n\nWait, for recursion, perhaps:\n\ndef count_paths(M, N):\n    from functools import lru_cache\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(i, j):\n        if I == M-1 and j == N-1:\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        if i+1 < M:\n            count += helper(i+1, j)\n        if j+1 < N:\n            count += helper(i, j+1)\n        return count\n    \n    return helper(0, 0)\n\nBut wait, in this case, the function starts at (0,0), and for each step, can go down or right. If i+1 is beyond M, or j+1 beyond N, it doesn't count that direction.\n\nBut this code will work correctly. Let me test for M=2,N=2.\n\nhelper(0,0) calls helper(1,0) and helper(0,1).\n\nhelper(1,0) can call helper(2,0) which is beyond M=2? Because in 2x2 grid, M=2 rows, so indices are 0 and1. So i+1 <M is 1+1 <2? 2<2 is false, so only move right.\n\nWait, in M=2, N=2, the indices go from 0 to1. So in the helper function, in line if i+1 < M: which for M=2, i can be 0 or1.\n\ni=0, i+1=1 <2: yes, proceed.\n\ni=1, i+1=2 <2: no, so no down move.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nSo for (1,0): i+1 < M is 1+1 <2? 2 <2? No, so can't move down, j+1 <N: 0+1 <2? yes, so can move right to (1,1). So helper(1,0) returns helper(1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is the destination, returns 1.\n\nSimilarly, helper(0,1) is called, same as helper(1,0): from (0,1), can move down to (1,1) or right which is beyond N, so only one move: helper(1,1), which is 1.\n\nThus, helper(0,0) is helper(1,0)+helper(0,1) =1 +1 =2, which is correct.\n\nFor M=3, N=3:\n\nhelper(0,0) calls helper(1,0) and helper(0,1).\n\nEach of these in turn call other cells, but through memoization, each cell is computed once.\n\nThe total should be 6, as computed before.\n\nBut for larger M, N, the recursive approach with memoization is acceptable for M,N up to 10x10.\n\nBut recursion in Python might have issues for very large M, N, but for up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nBut in terms of efficiency, both the iterative DP and recursive with memo are O(M*N). The difference is that the iterative is probably faster, but for M,N up to 10, the difference is negligible.\n\nSo, if I have to choose between the two, the iterative is more efficient in Python, since recursion has some overhead.\n\nMoreover, Python has a maximum recursion depth, which for 10x10 grid, it's just 10 steps in each direction, so it's okay.\n\nBut considering that, I can write either solution.\n\nBut looking back at the user's question: They want a function with memoization to optimize, and handle grid sizes up to 10x10.\n\nSo both approaches are acceptable, but as memoization is a technique often used in recursion, perhaps the recursive approach is what they're expecting.\n\nAlternatively, using memoization in an explicit way.\n\nWait, but in the iterative DP, the memo table is an explicit table, which is a form of memoization, just in an iterative way.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects the function to compute it recursively, so maybe I should present that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is interested in a combinatorial solution.\n\nBut since they specifically asked for a function with memoization, perhaps a recursive approach with memoization is expected.\n\nSo, to conclude, the options are:\n\n1. Iterative DP with memoization (using a table)\n\n2. Recursive approach with memoization.\n\n3. Combinatorial formula.\n\nBut the problem specifically says to use memoization, which applies more directly to the recursive approach, or the iterative DP approach. Since the iterative approach is more efficient, perhaps writing that.\n\nBut perhaps writing a function that uses memoization with a helper function is more aligned with the user's request.\n\nSo I'll write the recursive helper with memoization.\n\nThus, the function:\n\ndef count_paths(M, N):\n    from functools import lru_cache\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(i, j):\n        if i == M-1 and j == N-1:\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        if i+1 < M:\n            count += helper(i+1, j)\n        if j+1 < N:\n            count += helper(i, j+1)\n        return count\n\n    return helper(0, 0)\n\nTesting M=1, N=1: passes, returns 1.\n\nM=2,N=2: returns 2.\n\nBut wait, in the code, M and N are the number of rows and columns. For example, if M=2, it's a 2x2 grid. So the indices go from 0 to1 for both.\n\nBut if I call count_paths(1,1), it's a 1x1 grid, which should have 1 path.\n\nYes, in code, helper(0,0) is the start, which is the same as the end, returns 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut I should also ensure that the helper function doesn't call out of bounds. It uses i+1 < M and j+1 <N, so if M=1, i+1 <1 is false, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, this function should work.\n\nBut now, the problem is, in Python, M,N are passed as parameters but not used in the helper function directly except in the function definition. So, perhaps the code is okay.\n\nWait, the helper function is inside count_paths, which takes M,N as parameters, so it captures M,N, yes.\n\nThus, this should be correct.\n\nTherefore, both approaches are correct, but recursive with memoization fits the user's request.\n\nBut since the user possibly expects an efficient method, the memoization technique.\n\nHence, I'll provide the recursive solution with memoization.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe Python function to find the number of paths is:\n\n```python\ndef count_paths(M, N):\n    from functools import lru_cache\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(i, j):\n        if i == M - 1 and j == N - 1:\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        if i + 1 < M:\n            count += helper(i + 1, j)\n        if j + 1 < N:\n            count += helper(i, j + 1)\n        return count\n\n    return helper(0, 0)\n```\n\nThe number of paths from the top-left to the bottom-right is \\boxed{\\text{result of the function}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an M x N grid, where movement is restricted to right or down directions, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to optimize the solution.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be efficiently solved using a recursive helper function combined with memoization. The key idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, where the number of paths to each cell (i, j) is the sum of the paths to the cell above (i-1, j) and the cell to the left (i, j-1). Memoization is used to store the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n\n1. **Recursive Helper Function**: This function will compute the number of paths from the current cell (i, j) to the bottom-right corner. It will use memoization to store already computed results.\n2. **Base Case**: If the current cell (i, j) is the bottom-right corner, there is exactly one path (staying at that corner).\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each cell (i, j), if moving down is within bounds, add the paths from (i+1, j). Similarly, if moving right is within bounds, add the paths from (i, j+1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_paths(M, N):\n    from functools import lru_cache\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(i, j):\n        if i == M - 1 and j == N - 1:\n            return 1\n        count = 0\n        if i + 1 < M:\n            count += helper(i + 1, j)\n        if j + 1 < N:\n            count += helper(i, j + 1)\n        return count\n\n    return helper(0, 0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Memoization**: Using Python's `functools.lru_cache` decorator to store the results of the helper function ensures that each cell's number of paths is computed only once, significantly improving efficiency.\n- **Base Case Handling**: When the current cell is the bottom-right corner, the function returns 1 as there is only one way to be at this cell.\n- **Recursive Calls**: The function recursively calls itself for the cell below (i+1, j) and the cell to the right (i, j+1), summing the results to get the number of paths to the current cell.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of paths using memoization, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum grid size of 10x10.",
