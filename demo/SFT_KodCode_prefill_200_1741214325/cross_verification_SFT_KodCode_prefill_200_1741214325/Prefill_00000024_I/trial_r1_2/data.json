  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to write a Python function to find the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an M x N grid. The movement is restricted to only right or down at any point. The grid can be as large as 10x10, so efficiency is important. I should use memoization to optimize the algorithm.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of paths can be calculated using combinations. For a grid of size M x N, the number of steps required is (M-1) + (N-1) = M + N - 2 steps. Out of these, we need to choose (M-1) steps to move down or (N-1) steps to move right.\n\nThe formula should be (M + N - 2) choose (M - 1), which is equal to (M + N - 2)! / ((M - 1)! * (N - 1)!). However, calculating factorials for large numbers might be computationally intensive, but since the grid size is limited to 10x10, the maximum value for M + N - 2 is 18 (if both are 10), which isn't too bad.\n\nBut wait, if I'm supposed to use memoization, maybe a dynamic programming approach would be better. Hmm, but if M and N are up to 10, even a recursive solution with memoization should be efficient enough. Let's consider both approaches.\n\nLet me sketch out the possible methods.\n\n**Recursive Approach with Memoization:**\nThe idea is that the number of paths to reach a cell (m, n) is equal to the number of paths to reach (m-1, n) plus the number of paths to reach (m, n-1). This is because you can only arrive at (m, n) from either the top or the left.\n\nBase cases:\n- If m == 0 and n == 0, which is the starting point, there's 1 path (doing nothing).\n- If m == 0, you can only move right, so there's 1 path.\n- If n == 0, you can only move down, so there's 1 path.\n\nBut wait, in the grid, typically the top-left is (0,0) and the bottom-right is (M-1, N-1). So, in my function, I need to define the grid size as M x N, which would have M rows and N columns. Moving from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1). So the recursive function should be based on the current position, decreasing m and n as we move down and right respectively.\n\nSo the recursive relation would be:\npaths(m, n) = paths(m-1, n) + paths(m, n-1)\n\nWith base cases:\npaths(0, 0) = 1\npaths(m, 0) = 1 for any m\npaths(0, n) = 1 for any n\n\nBut implementing this recursively without memoization would be too slow, even for 10x10. So, to optimize, I'll use memoization to store already computed values.\n\n**Implementing with Memoization:**\nI'll create a memoization table, maybe a dictionary, to store the number of paths for each (m, n) pair. Before computing, I'll check if the value is already in the memo; if yes, return it, else compute and store it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use Python's functools.lru_cache decorator for memoization, which is more efficient and easier to implement.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n1. Define a helper function, say `paths(m, n)`, that computes the number of paths to (m, n) using recursion and memoization.\n2. Use memoization to store results of subproblems.\n3. The base cases will return 1 when either m or n is 0.\n4. Otherwise, return the sum of paths(m-1, n) and paths(m, n-1).\n\nWait, but when the grid is M x N, the starting point is (0,0) and ending at (M-1, N-1). So actually, we need to compute paths(M-1, N-1). But in the helper function, `paths(m, n)` will think of the end point as the current position.\n\nBut I could alternatively think of moving right as decreasing n and moving down as decreasing m, but it might complicate things. Let me stick with the movement approach where m and n represent the current position in the grid.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it in terms of steps. To go from (0,0) to (M-1, N-1), you have to make (M-1) down moves and (N-1) right moves in some order. So the number of unique paths is the combination of (M-1 + N-1) moves taken (M-1) at a time, which is the same as (M+N-2 choose M-1).\n\nSo another approach is to compute this using factorials.\n\n**Computing using Combinations:**\nWe can compute the formula directly.\n\nThe formula is C(M+N-2, M-1) = (M+N-2)! / [(M-1)! * (N-1)!]\n\nBut computing factorials for numbers up to 18 is manageable. However, calculating factorials directly could lead to very large numbers, but for M and N up to 10, it's acceptable. Additionally, we can compute the combination in a way that minimizes the risk of large intermediate values.\n\nFor example, compute the product for the numerator up to (M+N-2) and divide it by the product of the denominator terms. But to prevent division issues, we can compute it as a multiplicative formula where each step cancels out some factors.\n\nBut is that better than using memoization? Maybe, but considering the grid is only 10x10, the recursive approach is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for even better efficiency, perhaps a dynamic programming approach using a table is better. Let's think about that.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach:**\nWe can create a 2D array, dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j). Then, for each cell, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, and for the first row and first column, dp[i][0] = 1 and dp[0][j] = 1.\n\nBut considering the size is up to 10x10, both approaches (recursive with memoization and iterative DP) should be efficient. However, recursion might have a bit more overhead, and for M=N=10, it's only 10x10 = 100 computations, which is trivial.\n\nSo, maybe an iterative DP approach is more efficient because recursion in Python has stack limits, but for 10x10, it's unlikely to be a problem. Alternatively, using memoization with a dictionary is also manageable.\n\nBut for code simplicity, maybe the recursive approach with memoization using lru_cache is cleaner.\n\nWait, let's outline both methods.\n\n**Method 1: Recursive with Memoization**\n\nLet me draft the code:\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(m, n):\n        if m == 0 and n == 0:\n            return 1\n        if m == 0:\n            return helper(m, n-1)\n        if n == 0:\n            return helper(m-1, n)\n        return helper(m-1, n) + helper(m, n-1)\n    return helper(M-1, N-1)\n\nWait, but M and N are the grid sizes. For a grid that is M rows by N columns, the ending point is (M-1, N-1). So, helper(M-1, N-1) is correct.\n\nTesting for M=1, N=1: the grid is 1x1, starting and ending at the same cell, so 1 path.\n\nTesting M=2, N=2: should have 2 paths. Let's see:\n\nnumber_of_paths(2,2) will call helper(1,1), which calls helper(0,1) + helper(1,0). Each of those calls helper(0,0), so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nTesting M=3, N=2: It's a 3x2 grid, so the number of paths is 3. Let's verify with the helper function.\n\nhelper(2,1) = helper(1,1) + helper(2,0)\nhelper(2,0) is 1, as it's the first column.\n\nhelper(1,1) is helper(0,1) + helper(1,0) = 1 +1 = 2\nSo helper(2,1) = 2 +1=3, which is correct.\n\nSo this method works.\n\n**Method 2: Dynamic Programming**\n\nWe can create a DP table, initializing the first row and column with 1s, then filling the table.\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    dp = [[1 for _ in range(N)] for __ in range(M)]\n    for i in range(1, M):\n        for j in range(1, N):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]\n    return dp[M-1][N-1]\n\nTesting same cases:\n\nFor M=2, N=2: dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][0] = 1 +1=2. Correct.\n\nFor M=3, N=2: dp has 3 rows and 2 columns.\ndp[1][1] = 2, dp[2][1] = dp[1][1] + dp[2][0] = 2 +1=3. Correct.\n\nThis approach is also correct.\n\nComparing both methods:\n\nThe recursive method uses memoization, which has O(M*N) time and space complexity. The DP method is iterative and also O(M*N) time and space.\n\nHowever, memoization with recursion can have overhead, but for 10x10 grids, it's negligible. The DP method might be more efficient in practice because it avoids function call overhead.\n\nMoreover, the DP method is straightforward and probably faster for larger grids, though in this case, both are acceptable.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the DP method is more efficient and simpler to understand. But wait, actually for M x N grid, both will run in O(M*N), and for 10x10, it's 100 operations, which is trivial.\n\nBut in terms of memory, the DP method creates a 2D array of size M x N, whereas the memoization method stores only the necessary computed values, which is also M*N in the worst case.\n\nIn Python, function calls have some overhead, so for a 10x10 grid, the recursive method might have a few hundred function calls, each with some overhead, but it's not significant.\n\nAlternatively, to optimize, perhaps we can compute using the combination formula, which would be O(1) in terms of time if the combination is calculated directly. But wait, no, because it still involves multiplying numbers up to 18, which is manageable but not O(1).\n\nBut since M and N are small, it might be even faster to compute it using the combination formula.\n\n**Method 3: Using Combinations**\n\nWe can compute the combination using the multiplicative formula to avoid large intermediate factorials.\n\nThe number of paths is C(M + N - 2, M - 1) = (M + N - 2)! / ( (M - 1)! * (N - 1)! )\n\nBut calculating factorials can be done efficiently using a function or using the math module.\n\nBut calculating factorials might lead to larger numbers, but for M and N up to 10, (M + N -2) is at most 18, so 18! is manageable.\n\nIn Python, we can use the math.comb function, which is available in Python 3.10 and above. So, if that's acceptable, it's the simplest way.\n\nSo the function can be:\n\nimport math\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    return math.comb(M + N - 2, M - 1)\n\nBut wait, does this handle the memoization part? Well, it doesn't require memoization because it's a direct computation. However, the user specifically asked to use memoization. So perhaps the combination approach isn't what is expected, but it's more efficient.\n\nBut if the problem requires memoization, then using the recursive or DP approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, to strictly follow the question, which asks to use memoization, perhaps implementing the recursive approach with lru_cache is the way to go.\n\nSo, perhaps the recursive helper function with memoization is the best approach as per the question's instruction.\n\nBut another consideration is that the combination approach doesn't require any loops or recursion, and is the most efficient. Especially since for M and N up to 10, it's just a single computation. So the combination approach is likely the most efficient, even though it doesn't use memoization.\n\nBut the question specifies to use memoization. So, perhaps the problem expects the recursive approach with memoization, not the combination formula.\n\nAlternatively, the DP approach is also using a form of memoization because it's storing the subproblem solutions. So DP is a form of memoization, in a way, but it's iterative.\n\nGiven that, I think that the recursive approach with memoization is the one expected here.\n\nBut perhaps I can combine both: use the DP approach, which inherently uses memoization (storing results in a table), and it's more efficient than recursive with lru_cache.\n\nSo, let's structure the code:\n\nOption 1: Recursive with memoization.\n\nBut I'm thinking about the helper function. Wait, as per the code I wrote earlier:\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(m, n):\n        if m == 0 and n == 0:\n            return 1\n        if m == 0:\n            return helper(m, n-1)\n        if n == 0:\n            return helper(m-1, n)\n        return helper(m-1, n) + helper(m, n-1)\n    return helper(M-1, N-1)\n\nTesting this, for M=1, N=1: 1 path. Correct.\n\nBut, wait, what if M=0 or N=0? Probably, the function is called with M and N at least 1.\n\nSo, to prevent errors, perhaps the function should handle cases where M or N is 0 by returning 0, but since it's a grid, M and N should be at least 1.\n\nAssuming that, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nM=3, N=2: 3 paths. As before, the code correctly returns 3.\n\nBut using lru_cache for helper, which is an inner function, should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, in the DP approach, which is more efficient and has no recursion depth issues.\n\nIn the DP approach, I can write the code as:\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    dp = [[1]*N for _ in range(M)]\n    for i in range(1, M):\n        for j in range(1, N):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]\n    return dp[M-1][N-1]\n\nThis is concise and efficient.\n\nBut does it use memoization? Not exactly; it's dynamic programming, which is similar to memoization but in an iterative way. However, the question specifically mentions using memoization, so perhaps the DP approach isn't what is intended.\n\nBut some might consider DP as a form of memoization. However, in the strict sense, memoization refers to caching the results of function calls, which is what the recursive approach does.\n\nSo, to satisfy the requirement, the recursive approach with memoization is better.\n\nAlternatively, since M and N are small, the recursive approach is acceptable.\n\nAnother consideration: in the recursive approach, each call to helper(m, n) is unique, so for 10x10 grid, the maximum number of helper calls is 100, which is manageable.\n\nAnother thing: the DP approach uses O(M*N) space, while the recursive with lru_cache uses O(M*N) space as well.\n\nIn conclusion, both approaches are acceptable, but given the requirement for memoization, the recursive approach with lru_cache is appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the user's question says to write a function that can handle grids up to 10x10 efficiently. So, considering that, the recursive approach would be acceptable, but perhaps it's overkill when the DP approach is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, considering Python's maximum recursion depth. For M=10 and N=10, the maximum recursion depth would be log2(100), which is about 7, so well within the default recursion limit. Therefore, the recursive approach is safe.\n\nSo, I can proceed with the recursive approach using lru_cache.\n\nBut wait, when M=10 and N=10, the helper function will be called with m=9, n=9. The number of function calls would be summing over all m and n from 0 to 9, which is manageable.\n\nSo, I think implementing the recursive function with memoization using lru_cache is suitable.\n\nTherefore, the final code would be as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an M x N grid, where the only allowed movements are right or down. The solution should be efficient enough to handle grids as large as 10x10, and we will use memoization to optimize the algorithm.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached using a recursive solution with memoization. The key idea is to use a helper function that computes the number of paths to each cell (m, n) by summing the number of paths from the cell above (m-1, n) and the cell to the left (m, n-1). \n\nTo optimize this recursive solution, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems, thus avoiding redundant calculations and significantly improving efficiency. This approach ensures that each cell's value is computed only once, leading to an overall time complexity of O(M*N).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef number_of_paths(M, N):\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def helper(m, n):\n        if m == 0 and n == 0:\n            return 1\n        if m == 0:\n            return helper(m, n - 1)\n        if n == 0:\n            return helper(m - 1, n)\n        return helper(m - 1, n) + helper(m, n - 1)\n    \n    return helper(M - 1, N - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Recursive Function with Memoization:** The helper function `helper(m, n)` calculates the number of paths to reach cell (m, n) from the top-left corner. The results are cached using `lru_cache` to avoid redundant calculations.\n- **Base Cases:** \n  - If both m and n are 0, we are at the starting point, so there is 1 path.\n  - If m is 0, we can only move right, so there is 1 path.\n  - If n is 0, we can only move down, so there is 1 path.\n- **Recursive Case:** For any other cell (m, n), the number of paths is the sum of the paths from the cell above (m-1, n) and the cell to the left (m, n-1).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of paths using memoization, ensuring optimal performance even for the maximum grid size of 10x10.",
