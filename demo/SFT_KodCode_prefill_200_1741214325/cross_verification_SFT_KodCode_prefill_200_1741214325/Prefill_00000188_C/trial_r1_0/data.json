  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a recursive function called fibonacci that returns the nth Fibonacci number. Hmm, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. But wait, in some definitions it starts with 1 and 1. Oh right, looking at the examples, when n is 1 it returns 1, when n is 2 it also returns 1, so yeah, the sequence here is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.\n\nSo the function signature is given: def fibonacci(n: int) -> int. And there are several test cases. For n=0, it returns 0; n=1, 1; n=2, 1; n=5 gives 5, which must be 0+1+1+2+3? Wait no, wait. Wait n=5 is returning 5, so let's index them:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5\nval:0 1 1 2 3 5 \u2192 That matches the examples. So for n=5, the value is 5.\n\nBut wait the example for n=9 is 34. Let's see, the Fibonacci sequence goes like this:\n\nLet me list them:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = 1\nF(2) = 1 (0+1)\nF(3) = 2 (1+1)\nF(4) = 3 (1+2)\nF(5) = 5 (2+3)\nF(6) = 8\nF(7) =13\nF(8)=21\nF(9)=34 \u2192 yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the function should handle negative n as well. The example shows n=-5 returns 0. So, I need to handle cases where n is negative.\n\nSo first, in the base cases. For n=0, return 0. For n=1, return 1. What about if someone calls it with a negative n? Then we return 0.\n\nBut wait, I've heard that Fibonacci numbers can be extended to negative numbers, but perhaps in this problem, any negative n returns 0 is the requirement.\n\nSo, the function outline would be:\n\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n\nNow, for the logic, thinking recursively.\n\nThe standard recursive Fibonacci is: if n <= 0, return 0. Wait no, if n is 1, we return 1. Wait, base cases are:\n\nif n == 0: return 0\nelif n == 1: return 1\nelse: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nBut this is the naive recursive method, which is inefficient because it recalculates many values. But since the problem specifically asks to implement it using recursion, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nHowever, for negative n, the function returns 0 as per the example.\n\nSo, perhaps the base cases are:\n\nif n < 0: return 0\nelif n == 0: return 0\nelif n ==1: return 1\nelse: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nWait, let's test with the examples.\n\nn=0 \u21920 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1\u21921 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2 \u21921 \u2714\ufe0f (since fib(2) = fib(1)+fib(0)=1+0=1.\n\nn=5\u2192fib(4)+fib(3). fib(4)=3, fib(3)=2 \u21925 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=9\u219234 as above.\n\nn=-5 \u21920 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, what about the cases when n is negative? The function will return 0.\n\nSo, that should handle all the test cases.\n\nBut wait, when n is 2, according to the sample, it's 1. Because fib(2) is 1.\n\nWait, so counting as:\n\nn: 0 \u21920\n\nn:1 \u21921\n\nn:2 \u2192fib(1) + fib(0) \u21921+0=1.\n\nn:3\u2192fib(2) + fib(1) \u21921+1=2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo in the code, I need to first check if n is less than 0 \u2192 return 0.\n\nElse, if n is 0 \u21920.\n\nn=1 is base case.\n\nElse, recurse.\n\nSo that seems right.\n\nBut wait, what if someone calls n as a positive integer larger than 1, but non-integer? But the type hint says n is int, so the function is expecting that.\n\nBut wait, the function also handles all other possible n, including negative ones.\n\nWait, another way to test this: For example, n= -1: the function returns 0. Yes, per test case.\n\nOkay, so putting this together.\n\nNow, to write the code.\n\nSo the function will handle:\n\nif n <0: return 0\n\nelif n ==0: return 0\n\nelif n ==1: return 1\n\nelse: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code:\n\nfibonacci(0) \u21920. Correct.\n\nfibonacci(1) \u21921.\n\nfibonacci(2) \u2192fib(1)+fib(0) \u21921+0=1.\n\nfibonacci(5) \u21925.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=-5: returns 0.\n\nSo that's all handled.\n\nWait, what about if n is 3, it should return 2.\n\nfib(3)=fib(2)+fib(1) \u21921+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The task also requires handling negative indices by returning 0 for any negative input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence**: The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is formed by adding the previous two numbers.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - If `n` is negative, return 0.\n   - If `n` is 0, return 0.\n   - If `n` is 1, return 1.\n3. **Recursive Case**: For any other value of `n`, compute the Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers, i.e., `fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle both positive and negative indices correctly, and it leverages the recursive nature of the Fibonacci sequence to compute the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Returns the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.\n    Handles negative n by returning 0 and follows the sequence starting with 0, 1, 1, 2, etc.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Handling Negative Indices**: The function immediately returns 0 if `n` is negative, as per the problem's requirement.\n- **Base Cases**: The function returns known values for `n = 0` and `n = 1` without any computation.\n- **Recursive Case**: For `n > 1`, the function calls itself recursively to compute the two preceding Fibonacci numbers and returns their sum. This recursive approach ensures that each Fibonacci number is built upon previously computed values, following the sequence definition accurately.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the Fibonacci computation using recursion, though it's important to note that a naive recursive approach can be inefficient for larger values of `n` due to repeated computations. However, it directly follows the problem's requirement for a recursive implementation.",
