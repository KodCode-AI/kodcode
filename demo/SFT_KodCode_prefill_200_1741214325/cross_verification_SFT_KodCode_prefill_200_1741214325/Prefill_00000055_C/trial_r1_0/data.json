  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called is_isomorphic that checks if two strings s1 and s2 are isomorphic. Hmm, what's an isomorphic string again? Oh right, it's when each character in s1 can be replaced to get s2, while maintaining the same structure. So the same characters in s1 must map to the same characters in s2, and different ones must map to different. \n\nLet me think about the examples given. For \"egg\" and \"add\", it's true because e->a and g->d. In both words, the first and second characters are the same in s1? Wait, egg is 'e','g','g' and add is 'a','d','d', so that's correct. \n\nAnother example: \"foo\" vs \"bar\" returns false. Because foo is f,o,o and bar is b,a,r. So o can't map to both a and r. Or alternatively, each occurrence in s1 must map uniquely. \n\nSo how can I translate this into code? Maybe I need to create two mappings: one from s1 to s2 and another from s2 to s1. Because if two different characters in s1 map to the same in s2, that's invalid. Similarly, if two different in s2 are mapped to by s1, that's also a problem.\n\nSo here's the plan: I'll go through each character in both strings simultaneously. For each position i, I'll check the mappings. \n\nFirst, if the two strings have different lengths, they can't be isomorphic. So I should first check len(s1) == len(s2). If not, return False.\n\nThen, I'll create two dictionaries: map1 for s1 to s2, and map2 for s2 to s1.\n\nFor each i from 0 to len(s1)-1:\n   char1 = s1[i]\n   char2 = s2[i]\n\n   if char1 is not in map1:\n       check if char2 is already in map2. Because if char2 is already mapped by another char (say, s1's 'a' already maps to 'x'), then s2's 'x' can't be mapped again. So if char2 is in map2 but not in map1 for this char1, then it's invalid. So if char1 not in map1 and char2 in map2: return False.\n\n       So add char1:char2 to both maps.\n\n   else:\n       check if map1[char1] is equal to char2. If not, return False.\n\nSimilarly, because the mapping must be bidirectional, we need to ensure that each char in s2 is mapped by only one from s1. So when we add a new entry in map1, we also check map2 for the corresponding s2's char.\n\nLet me try to outline this in code:\n\nFirst check the lengths.\nif len(s1)!=len(s2):\n    return False\n\ncreate two empty dictionaries, map_s1 and map_s2.\n\nthen, for each i in range(len(s1)):\n    c1 = s1[i]\n    c2 = s2[i]\n\n    if c1 not in map_s1:\n        if c2 in map_s2:\n            # because another c1 has already claimed this c2\n            return False\n        map_s1[c1] = c2\n        map_s2[c2] = c1\n    else:\n        # check if the mapped value is correct\n        if map_s1[c1] != c2:\n            return False\n\nand also, for c2, check if it's mapped from some other c1.\nWait, no, because the map_s2 ensures that each c2 is only mapped from one c1. Because in the if condition, before adding a new mappings, we check if c2 is in map_s2.\n\nSo that should cover both directions.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example: s1=\"egg\", s2=\"add\"\n\nLoop:\ni=0: c1='e', c2='a'\ne not in map_s1, a not in map_s2. So add e->a and a->e.\n\ni=1: c1='g', c2='d'\ng not in map_s1, d not in map_s2. Add g->d and d->g.\n\ni=2: c1='g' (exists in map_s1), so check if map_s1['g'] is 'd' which it is. So nothing else.\n\nSo returns True.\n\nSecond example: \"foo\", \"bar\"\n\ns1='f','o','o' and s2='b','a','r'\n\ni=0: 'f' not in map_s1 and 'b' not in map_s2. Add f->b and b->f.\n\ni=1: 'o' not in map_s1, check if 'a' is in map_s2. 'a' is not, so add o->a and a->o.\n\ni=2: c1 is 'o', which is mapped to a. s2's c2 is 'r'. So check if map_s1['o'] is 'r'? No, it's a. So return False. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example: \"paper\" vs \"title\" should return True.\n\npaper: p,a,p,e,r\ntitle: t,i,t,l,e\n\nWait that's not correct, because p and t would map, a->i, etc.\n\nWait s1 is p a p e r? So indices 0,1,2,3,4. s2 is t,i,t,l,e.\n\nSo at i=0: p->t\ni=1: a->i (since a not mapped)\ni=2: p already mapped to t, so must be s2[2] =t. Yes, because s2[2] is t.\n\nThen at i=3: e-> l. Because in s1[3] is 'e' not in map_s1. Check s2[3], which is 'l', not in map_s2. So add e->l. Then, at i=4, s1[4] = r: not mapped. s2[4] is 'e' which is in map_s2 because map_s2['l'] is e? Wait, wait, map_s2 mappings are s2 -> s1.\n\nWait: when i=3, c2 is 'l', so added to map_s2 as 'l' -> 'e'? Or wait, when adding, for each c2, map_s2[c2] = c1. So in i=0, 't' is added to map_s2 as map['t'] = 'p'. i=1: 'i' maps to 'a'. i=2: 't' is already in map_s2 as 'p' so no change. i=3: 'l' is added as 'e'. i=4: c2 is 'e' which is not in map_s2 yet. So check: in the step i=4, c1 is 'r', not mapped.\n\nSo add 'r'->'e' and 'e'->'r' to the maps.\n\nWait, this might cause a problem because in i=3, when 'e' is mapped to 'l', then in i=4, 'r' is mapped to 'e'. So the forward maps are:\n\np->t, a->i, p->t, e->l, r->e.\n\nBut let's think: in s2, the 'e' is in position 4.\n\nBut after i=4, map_s2 would have 'e' mapped from r. But 'e' was mapped in the s1's earlier i=3 as 'e'->'l', and in i=4: 'e' is in s2[4], which is mapped to 'r' via map_s2['e'] = r. So are these conflicting?\n\nWait the rules are:\n\nEach character in s1 maps to exactly one in s2, and each in s2 must come from exactly one in s1.\n\nSo for the current step, in i=4, since 'r' is not mapped yet, and since 'e' is s2's character, the code first checks if 'e' is in map_s2. At this point, 'e' is not, because in i=3, it's s2's character was 'l', and 'e' is in s1. Oh wait:\n\ni=3: s1 is 'e', s2 is 'l'. So map_s1['e'] = 'l'; map_s2['l'] = 'e'.\n\nSo when in i=4, c1 is 'r', not in map_s1. c2 is 'e', not in map_s2. So we add r->e and e->r.\n\nSo that's okay, because 'e' in s2 was previously not mapped by any s1 character except when it's s2's character is 'e'?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way map_s2 works. Because the way the code is structured, when we process i=3, we are adding s1's 'e' to map_s1 as 'e' -> 'l', and map_s2's 'l' -> 'e'. So s2's 'l' is now taken by 'e' of s1.\n\nThen in i=4, s2's 'e' is not mapped yet, because for i=4:\n\ncheck c1 'r' not in map_s1: so check if s2's 'e' is in map_s2. It's not, because map_s2 for 'e' hasn't been added yet.\n\nSo we proceed to add 'r'->'e' to map_s1 and 'e'->'r' to map_s2. Now, looking up map_s2: when any further 'e's in s2 are encountered, they have to map to 'r'.\n\nBut in this example, the s2 is \"title\", which has 'e' only at the last position. So it's okay.\n\nBut what about when, later, another 'e' in s2 comes up? For example, if s2 was 'titlee' and s1 was 'paperr'? Then 'e' in s2 is mapped to 'r', but what if another 'e' in s2 is expected to map to something else?\n\nWait, in that case, when processing the first 'e' in s2, at i=4, we have 'r' mapped to 'e' and 'e' to 'r'. Then, in a subsequent i, say i=5, c2 is 'e' again. At that point, when c1 is (say) 'r', which is mapped to 'e', that's okay because map_s1['r'] is 'e' which requires c2 to be 'e'. But if c1 is some other character not 'r', but c2 is 'e', then it's invalid.\n\nSo that seems to handle it.\n\nAnother example: \"a\", \"a\" returns True.\n\nAnother example: \"aab\", \"ccd\". Let's see:\n\ns1: a, a, b\n\ns2: c, c, d\n\ni=0: a not in map_s1, c not in map_s2. Add a->c and c->a.\n\ni=1: a is in map_s1, which points to c. Correct, c2 is c. So yes.\n\ni=2: c1 is b not in map_s1. c2 is d not in map_s2. So add b->d and d->b.\n\nSo returns true.\n\nAnother example: is_isomorphic(\"ab\", \"aa\") returns False. Because s1[0] is a -> a, s1[1] is b, and s2[1] is a. So when i=1:\n\nCheck if b is in map_s1: no. Then check if s2[1] (a) is in map_s2. Yes, because a was added in i=0 as 'a'-> 'a' in map_s2. So trying to add b -> a, but a is already in map_s2, so it returns False.\n\nYes, that will correctly return False.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, what about when one string is empty? The first check handles that because if both are empty, lengths are equal and loop doesn't run. So returns True.\n\nWhat about when one is longer than the other? The first condition returns false.\n\nSo now, putting it all into code.\n\nI'll write:\n\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n\n    map_s1 = {}  # s1 char to s2 char\n    map_s2 = {}  # s2 char to s1 char\n\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 not in map_s1:\n            if c2 in map_s2:\n                return False\n            map_s1[c1] = c2\n            map_s2[c2] = c1\n        else:\n            if map_s1[c1] != c2:\n                return False\n\n    return True\n\nWait, but what about when c1 is in map_s1, and c2 exists as a key in map_s2 but mappings are different? Wait, perhaps the code doesn't check that. No, because when c1 is in map_s1, the code only checks if map_s1[c1] is c2. But if map_s2[c2] isn't c1, that's okay? No, it's not. Because if, in map_s2, c2 is mapped to another character, that's a problem. Because in that case, c2 is mapping to a different c1 than we had before. \n\nWait, for example:\n\ns1 = \"ab\"\ns2 = \"aa\"\n\ni=0: c1='a' not in map_s1, c2='a' not in map_s2. map_s1 a->a, map_s2 a->a.\n\ni=1: c1='b' not in map_s1, c2='a' is in map_s2. So trying to add b->a, but c2 is already in map_s2 (mapped to a). So return false.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother scenario: what if in the same strings, s1[1] maps to a c2 that's already mapped in map_s2 from a different c1. So, the code currently doesn't catch that because it only checks when c1 is not in map_s1.\n\nWait, no. Because map_s2 is built in the same time as map_s1, but only when c1 isn't in map_s1. So in cases where a previous c1 has been mapped to c2, and a new c1 is also mapped to c2, that's definitely a problem.\n\nWait, but in that case, the code should catch it in one of the checks. Let's see.\n\nSuppose s1 is 'ab', s2 is 'bc'.\n\ni=0: c1 'a' not in map_s1. c2 is 'b' not in map_s2. So map_s1 a->b, map_s2 b->a.\n\ni=1: c1 'b' is not in map_s1. c2 is 'c' not in map_s2. So add b->c and c->b.\n\nSo this is correct because each c1 is mapped to unique c2 and vice versa.\n\nBut now, if the strings were 'ab' and 'cb', then:\n\ni=0: a -> c, c ->a.\n\ni=1: b -> b, which is not in map_s1. So check if b is in map_s2 (map_s2 for 'c' is 'a'). 'b' is not in map_s2, because so far only 'c' is in map_s2. So process: add b->b, and map_s2 b->b.\n\nThus isomorphic? Well, the mappings a->c, b->b. So s1 ab is c b; s2 is c b. So yes, isomorphic.\n\nBut let's imagine if s2 was 'cc':\n\ns1: a,b --> a (say, both are 'c's).\n\nAt i=0: a is not in map_s1. c2 is 'c', not in map_s2. Add a->c, c->a.\n\ni=1: c1='b' not in map_s1. c2 is 'c' which is in map_s2 (it's mapped to a). So trying to add b->c, but c is already in map_s2 as a's mapped. So function returns False correctly.\n\nWhat if s2 is 'ca'? s1 is ab.\n\ni=0: a maps to c, c maps to a.\n\ni=1: b not in map_s1. c2 is a.\n\nCheck if a is in map_s2: map_s2 is {'c': 'a'}. No, because a is not a key in map_s2.\n\nWait wait, no: in i=0, the code processed c1=a and c2=c. So map_s2 is {c: a}.\n\nIn i=1, c2 is a. So in map_s2, a is not present. So the code will check if a is in map_s2 for i=1: no, so it can proceed to add b->a and a->b. But this would create a problem.\n\nBecause now, in map_s2, c is mapped to a, and a is mapped to b.\n\nBut now, looking back to s1's a and s2's c, that's still okay.\n\nBut in s2, a is being mapped to b as well.\n\nBut this is allowed because in the first case, a in map_s2 was added for the second i.\n\nWait, but for the s2 string, when s2[i] is a for i=1, which is in the second process.\n\nBut the concern is whether every occurrence of a in s2 maps to the same in s1.\n\nIn this case, let's say in s2, the second character is a, which maps to b. Then if s2 had another a in a third position, it would have to map to b as well.\n\nSo is this until the end, so the function correctly enforces that.\n\nWait but in this scenario, would it be isomorphic? s1 is a,b, s2 is c,a. Then the mapping is a->c, b->a. So in s2, a corresponds to b. So in that case:\n\ns1 is a -> c, b->a. So for s1, if you have subsequent a's, they map to c correctly.\n\nBut what's the actual problem? Wait in this example, maps are a->c and b->a. So isomorphic would be True because each s1 character maps to one in s2, and vice versa.\n\nBoth s1 and s2 have each unique character mapping uniquely.\n\nWait, but s2's a is mapped from s1's b, and s2's c is from s1's a. So if s2's string is 'ca', it's because s1 is a, then b.\n\nWhich is acceptable because isomorphic allows different mappings as long as they are consistent.\n\nSo the function allowed this, and it's correct.\n\nBut if I have s1 = 'aa', and s2 = 'bb', the function correctly returns Turth.\n\nAnother tricky case: s1 = \"abc\", s2 = \"def\". Both are 3 letters. Each s1 character maps to a new s2 character. So function returns true.\n\nWhat if s1's \"abbc\" and s2's \"aabb\"? For s1, 'a' maps to 'a', 'b' to 'a' (since the first b in s1 would set 'b'->a's second character which is a).\n\nWait, let's think exactly.\n\nWait, s1 is 'a','b','b','c' and s2 is 'a','a','b','b'. \n\nWhen i=0: c1='a', c2='a': add a->a, a->a in the maps.\n\ni=1: c1='b', not in map_s1. c2='a' is in map_s2 (because a is a key, which is mapped from a). So when we try to add b->a, since a is already in map_s2 and we are trying to add a new mapping to it, we return false.\n\nWhich is correct, because in this case, s1's 'b' can't map to s2's 'a' because 'a' is already mapped from s1's 'a'.\n\nSo the function correctly returns False.\n\nAll right, I think this logic should handle all cases correctly. Now, I'll code this in Python.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if two given strings are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string while preserving the structure. This means that each character in the first string must map to exactly one character in the second string, and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, if the two strings have different lengths, they cannot be isomorphic. This is because the structure of the strings must be identical, so the number of characters must match.\n\n2. **Create Mappings**: Use two dictionaries to map characters from the first string to the second string and vice versa. This ensures that each character in the first string maps to exactly one character in the second string and each character in the second string is mapped by exactly one character from the first string.\n\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each character in the strings, check if the mappings are consistent. If a character is already mapped, ensure that it maps to the same character in the other string. If a new character is encountered, check if the corresponding character in the other string has already been mapped. If it has, the strings are not isomorphic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n\n    map_s1 = {}  # Maps characters from s1 to s2\n    map_s2 = {}  # Maps characters from s2 to s1\n\n    for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2):\n        if c1 not in map_s1:\n            # Check if c2 is already mapped from another character in s1\n            if c2 in map_s2:\n                return False\n            map_s1[c1] = c2\n            map_s2[c2] = c1\n        else:\n            # Ensure the mapped value is consistent\n            if map_s1[c1] != c2:\n                return False\n\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Lengths**: The function first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, it returns `False`.\n\n2. **Create Mappings**: Two dictionaries, `map_s1` and `map_s2`, are used to track the mappings between characters of the two strings. `map_s1` maps characters from `s1` to `s2`, and `map_s2` maps characters from `s2` to `s1`.\n\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each pair of characters from `s1` and `s2`, the function checks if the characters have been mapped before. If a character from `s1` is not mapped, it checks if the corresponding character in `s2` has been mapped by another character from `s1`. If so, the strings are not isomorphic. If the characters are already mapped, it ensures the mappings are consistent.\n\nThis approach ensures that each character from both strings is mapped correctly and consistently, thus determining if the strings are isomorphic.",
