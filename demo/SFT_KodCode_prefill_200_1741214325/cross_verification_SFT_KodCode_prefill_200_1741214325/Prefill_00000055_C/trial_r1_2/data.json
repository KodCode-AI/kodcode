  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called is_isomorphic that checks if two strings are isomorphic. Hmm, right, I remember that two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s1 can be replaced to get s2. So each character in s1 maps to exactly one character in s2 and vice versa. Wait, no, actually, in isomorphic strings, it's a bijective mapping. So like, each character in s1 maps to a unique character in s2, but no different characters in s1 can map to the same character in s2. Oh wait, is it bijective in both directions? Or just that the mapping is consistent from s1 to s2, and also from s2 to s1?\n\nHmm, I think maybe what matters is that the structure of the two strings is the same in terms of character replacement. Like for example, 'egg' and 'add' are isomorphic. E maps to A, G maps to D. So in the first string, the first occurrence is E, which becomes the first occurrence in the second string as A. Then the two Gs become two Ds. So it's the pattern that matters.\n\nWait, so perhaps we can model this by creating two dictionaries: one for s1 to s2 mapping and another for s2 to s1. But then, for each character in both strings, we need to ensure that the mapping is consistent.\n\nSo the steps I can think of are:\n\n1. Check if the two strings are of the same length. Because if they're not, they can't be isomorphic. Right, if one is longer, no way the mapping works.\n\nSo, first, if len(s1) != len(s2), return False.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\n2. Create two dictionaries: s1_map which maps characters from s1 to s2, and s2_map which maps characters from s2 to s1.\n\nWait, but actually, for the strings to be isomorphic, each character in s1 must map to exactly one in s2, and each character in s2 must map back to exactly one in s1. So for example, if in s1 \"a\" maps to \"b\", then in s2, \"b\" must map back to \"a\".\n\nWait no, I think the correct way is to make sure that the pattern of characters is the same. So for example, in the string s1, each position's pattern is such that each new unique character is mapped accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach is to convert both strings into their pattern of occurrences. For example, for \"egg\", the pattern would be something like 0,1,1 (since the first character is new, second is new, third same as second). For \"add\", the pattern would be 0,0,1, no wait, no: 'a' is first, 'd' is second, etc.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should represent the pattern where each new character is assigned an incrementing number based on their order of occurrence.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nFor s1 = \"egg\", the first character is 'e' (new, so 0), the next character is 'g' (new, assign 1), next is again 'g' (so 1). So the structure is [0,1,1].\n\nFor s2 = \"add\", the first character is 'a' (0), second is 'd' (1), third is 'd' (1). So the structure is [0,1,1]. Since the structures are the same, the strings are isomorphic.\n\nSimilarly, for 'paper' and 'title': 'p' is 0, 'a' 1, 'p'0, 'e'2, 'r'3. So structure for paper is [0,1,0,2,3]. For title: 't' is 0, 'i' 1, 't'0, 'l'2, 'e'3. So structure is the same.\n\nBut when 'foo' and 'bar' are checked: 'foo' becomes [0,0,1], 'bar' becomes [0,1,2]. So their structures differ. So they are not isomorphic.\n\nWait, but how do I generate these structures? I can think of a helper function that, given a string, returns the pattern as a list of integers.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to replace each character with the index of their first occurrence. So for 'egg', e is first, so it's 0, g is next first, so 1, etc.\n\nWait, for each character in the string, we can track the order in which they appear, and create a tuple that represents the positions. Then, compare the two tuples from s1 and s2.\n\nLet me think about how to generate this tuple.\n\nFor example, take 'egg' and 'add':\n\nFor 'e', the first occurrence is position 0. 'g' occurs first at position 1. Then another 'g' at position 1.\n\nSo the sequence is [0, 1, 1].\n\nSimilarly, for 'add', the sequence for the same structure.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCreate a transformation for each string where each character is replaced by the index of its first occurrence in the string.\n\nThen, check if the two transformed lists are identical.\n\nHow do I create this for a string s?\n\nIdea:\n\nInitialize a dictionary that keeps track of the order in which new characters are encountered.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n   if the character is not in the dictionary, add it with the current value (which is the next available index, say, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time a new character is found).\n\n   then, append the index to the transformed list.\n\nWait, but for example, for the first character, let's say 'e' in 'egg' is not in the dictionary. So we add 'e' : 0 to the dict. The transformed is [0]. Then next character 'g' is not in the dict, add 'g':1. So the transformed is [0, 1]. The third 'g' is already in the dict, so we append its value, which is 1. So [0,1,1] as before.\n\nSimilarly, for 'add'\u2014 'a' is 0, 'd' is 1, second 'd' is 1.\n\nSo, the helper function to create this transformed list would help compare whether the two strings have the same pattern.\n\nSo for two strings s1 and s2, if both their transformed patterns are equal, then they are isomorphic.\n\nSo the steps for the function are:\n\n- if s1 and s2 have different lengths, return False.\n\n- if the lengths are 0 (both empty), return True.\n\n- Else, transform both s1 and s2 into their pattern lists.\n\n- Compare the two patterns. If they are equal, return True; else, False.\n\nSo the question is how to implement the helper function to compute the pattern for a given string.\n\nWait, perhaps a helper function called get_pattern(s) that returns the pattern as a tuple or a list.\n\nHow?\n\nLet's think:\n\ndef get_pattern(s):\n    mapping = {}\n    pattern = []\n    counter = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char not in mapping:\n            mapping[char] = counter\n            counter += 1\n        pattern.append(mapping[char])\n    return pattern\n\nWait, no, for 'egg', the first e is 0, g is 1. So the output is [0,1,1]\u2014correct.\n\nFor 'add', a is 0, d is 1. So [0,1,1], which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the 'foo' example, let me see.\n\ns1 = 'foo': first 'f' is 0, then 'o' not in mapping, so 1. So pattern is [0,1,1].\n\ns2 = 'bar': 'b' 0, 'a'1, 'r'2: so pattern [0,1,2]. Which would not match with [0,1,1]. So the helper function works here.\n\nAnother example, \"ab\" and \"aa\". For 'ab', the pattern is [0,1]. For 'aa', it's [0,0]. So patterns differ: function returns False, which is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_isomorphic(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    if len(s1) == 0:\n        return True\n    pattern_s1 = get_pattern(s1)\n    pattern_s2 = get_pattern(s2)\n    return pattern_s1 == pattern_s2\n\nBut wait, the helper function, as written, will capture the order of new characters. But is that sufficient?\n\nWait, what about a case where the mapping could be different, but the overall pattern structure is the same. Like, for example, s1='abc' and s2='def'. Their helper pattern would both be [0,1,2], so the function would return True. Which is correct, because 'a'->'d', 'b'->'e', 'c'->'f', so isomorphic.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function is correct. But wait, what about the earlier test case where 'ab' and 'aa' are compared? The length is same (2), so it proceeds. The patterns are [0,1] vs [0,0], which are different: correct.\n\nBut is the helper function correct? Earlier, in the thinking, for \"paper\" and \"title\", the helper function returns the same pattern.\n\nTesting 'paper' (p,a,p,e,r): p is 0, a is 1, p again is 0, e is 2, r is3. So pattern is [0,1,0,2,3].\n\nFor 'title': t is 0, i is 1, t is 0, l is 2, e is 3. So same pattern.\n\nSo the helper function will correctly return True.\n\nTherefore, this seems solid.\n\nBut what about if the function needs to consider two-way mapping? For example, if s1 and s2 are swapped in the character order, but the helper would still capture the same structure.\n\nNo, the helper simply looks at the order of new characters, which is correct.\n\nWait, another test case: s1 = 'aaabbb' and s2 = '111222'. Then, the patterns are [0,0,0,1,1,1] for both, so isomorphic.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the helper function approach should handle this.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the test cases given:\n\nAnother test case is is_isomorphic(\"aabb\", \"ccdd\") is True. Let's see.\n\ns1='aabb': a is 0, a is 0, b is 1, b is1. So pattern [0,0,1,1].\n\ns2='ccdd': c is 0, c 0, d 1, d 1. Same pattern.\n\nSo the function would return True, correct.\n\nAnother test case is is_isomorphic(\"ab\", \"aa\") is False: yes.\n\nSo the helper function should work as intended.\n\nTherefore, the approach is solid. Now, to write the code.\n\nWait, but in the helper function, for each character, it's assigned a number based on the order of their first occurrence. That should be correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nImplement the helper function, then compare the two patterns.\n\nNow, let me write the code.\n\nWait, but alternatively, without using a helper function, perhaps I can inline the code.\n\nBut for clarity, using a helper makes sense.\n\nBut in Python, functions must be defined inside each other, but perhaps in this case, to avoid cluttering, perhaps just compute the pattern inside the function without a helper.\n\nAlternatively, in the main function, compute pattern for s1 and s2 in a similar way.\n\nWait, perhaps that's better.\n\nSo, inside is_isomorphic, after checking the lengths are same, we generate two mappings.\n\nWait, no: the approach using the helper function is correct.\n\nBut for code brevity, perhaps the helper function can be included.\n\nBut the helper function must receive a string and return a tuple of the pattern.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    if len(s1) == 0:\n        return True\n\n    def get_pattern(s):\n        mapping = {}\n        pattern = []\n        counter = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char not in mapping:\n                mapping[char] = counter\n                counter += 1\n            pattern.append(mapping[char])\n        return pattern\n\n    pattern_s1 = get_pattern(s1)\n    pattern_s2 = get_pattern(s2)\n    return pattern_s1 == pattern_s2\n\nWait, but hold on. Is this method sufficient in all cases?\n\nLet me think about a case where s1 is 'ab' and s2 is 'ba'. For example, s1='ab', s2='ba'.\n\nIn s1: a is 0, b is 1. So the pattern is [0,1].\n\nIn s2: b is 0, a is 1. So the pattern is [0,1].\n\nWait, but wait, for s2='ba':\n\nget_pattern calls:\n\ns is 'ba'\n\nmapping starts empty.\n\nFirst char: 'b' not in mapping, so add 'b' :0. pattern [0].\n\nNext char 'a' not in mapping: add 'a' :1. pattern [0,1].\n\nSimilarly, for 'ab', same pattern [0,1]?\n\nSo is_isomorphic(s1='ab', s2='ba') returns True.\n\nBut are these strings isomorphic?\n\nBecause in s1 'a' maps to 'b'-s2's first character.\n\n's2' 'b' in s2's first position.\n\nWait, but actually in this case, the patterns are the same because the helper function is tracking the order of occurrence.\n\nWait, think of s1= 'ab' and s2='ba'.\n\nDo they have isomporphism?\n\nYes. Because the isomorphism is structure-based. Each character in s1 is mapped to a corresponding character in s2. So 'a' in s1 can be mapped to 'b' and 'b' to 'a', which makes the two strings isomorphic.\n\nThus, is_isomorphic('ab', 'ba') should return True.\n\nThus, the helper function, which would return same patterns, is correct.\n\nAnother case: s1='abc', s2='def' \u2192 isomorphic and returns True.\n\nSo the helper function seems to correctly capture the structural patterns.\n\nWhat about a tricky case like s1='aba' and s2='bab'? s1: a is 0, b is1, a is 0. So pattern [0,1,0].\n\ns2: b is 0, a is1, b is0 \u2192 pattern [0,1,0]. So the function returns True. Indeed, both are isomorphic, as a\u2192b and b\u2192a.\n\nSo the helper function handles this.\n\nSo, I think this approach will work.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the helper function in this way is not the right approach, but perhaps using a different way to represent the structure. Because the helper function is based on the order of first occurrence. So for '_flip'(hypothetically), 'ab' and 'cd'\u2014same pattern [0,1], so function returns True, which is correct.\n\nSo everything seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. What about the case where the helper function may not capture the correct structure because a same new character might appear in a different order.\n\nWait, no. Because the helper function is assigning based on the order they are first encountered. So the structure is captured as the earliest character is 0, the next new one is 1, and so on.\n\nYes, that's how it should work.\n\nAnother test: s1 = 'egg', s2='add' \u2192 [0,1,1] and [0,1,1] \u2192 True.\n\ns1='foo', s2='bar' \u2192 [0,0,1] and [0,1,2] \u2192 so returns False. Which is correct.\n\nSo looks like the helper function is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if two given strings are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the other string, maintaining the same structure.\n\n### Approach\nThe key idea is to check if there is a consistent one-to-one mapping between the characters of both strings. This can be achieved by converting each string into a pattern based on the order of the first occurrence of each character. \n\nFor example, converting a string into a pattern involves assigning each new character an incrementing integer based on the order in which it appears. For instance, the string \"egg\" would be converted to the pattern [0, 1, 1] because 'e' is the first unique character, 'g' is the second, and the third character 'g' refers back to the second unique character.\n\nIf both strings convert to the same pattern, they are isomorphic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    if len(s1) == 0:\n        return True\n\n    def get_pattern(s):\n        mapping = {}\n        pattern = []\n        counter = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char not in mapping:\n                mapping[char] = counter\n                counter += 1\n            pattern.append(mapping[char])\n        return pattern\n\n    pattern_s1 = get_pattern(s1)\n    pattern_s2 = get_pattern(s2)\n    return pattern_s1 == pattern_s2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, we check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, they cannot be isomorphic, so we return False.\n2. **Handle Empty Strings**: If both strings are empty, they are trivially isomorphic, so we return True.\n3. **Generate Patterns**: For each string, we generate a pattern where each new character is assigned an incrementing integer based on its first occurrence. This is done using a helper function `get_pattern`.\n4. **Compare Patterns**: Finally, we compare the generated patterns of both strings. If they match, the strings are isomorphic, and we return True; otherwise, we return False.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify the structural similarity between the two strings, capturing the essence of isomorphism.",
