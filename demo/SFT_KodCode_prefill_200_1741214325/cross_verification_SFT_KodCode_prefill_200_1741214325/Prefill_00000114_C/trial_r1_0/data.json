  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function called is_prime that takes an integer n and returns a boolean indicating whether n is a prime number. Hmm, okay, let's start by thinking about what a prime number is. A prime is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nWait, but wait. What about numbers like 0, 1, or negative numbers? Oh right, primes are defined as positive integers greater than 1, so if n is less than 2, the function should return False. That's a good starting point.\n\nSo the first thing in the function, I should check if n is less than 2. If it is, return False because it's not prime. That's easy enough.\n\nNow, for numbers 2 and above. Well, 2 is the smallest prime. So if n is 2, it should return True.\n\nNext, for numbers greater than 2, I need to check if they have any divisors other than 1 and themselves. A common approach is to check for divisibility up to the square root of n. Because if n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so we would have already found it.\n\nOkay, so the plan is: if n is less than 2, return False. If n is 2 or 3, return True. For even numbers, if n is divisible by 2, return False because even numbers greater than 2 aren't primes.\n\nThen, for odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of n, I need to check if any of them divide n without a remainder. If I find any such divisor, it's not a prime. If none divide n, then it is a prime.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently implement this in Python? Let me outline it step by step.\n\nThe function starts by handling the cases where n is less than 2, returning False. Then, if n is 2 or 3, return True since they are primes. Then, if n is even (n % 2 ==0), return False because it's divisible by 2.\n\nOtherwise, for n greater than 3 and odd, I'll loop through odd numbers starting from 3 up to sqrt(n). Wait, but how to calculate the square root. Oh right, in Python, we can use n ** 0.5, but since we are dealing with integers, it's better to convert it to an integer and iterate up to that.\n\nSo the loop would start at 3, increment by 2 each time, and go up to sqrt_n. For each i in this range, check if n is divisible by i. If yes, return False. If no divisors found, return True.\n\nLet me think of some examples. For instance, n=9: sqrt(9) is 3. So the loop would check 3, and since 9%3 is 0, it returns False, which is correct because 9 is not a prime.\n\nAnother example, n=7. The square root is approximately 2.645, so the loop starts at 3 but since 3 is greater than 2.645, the loop doesn't run. So it returns True, which is correct.\n\nWhat about a larger number, say n=17. The square root is about 4.123. So the loop runs i=3, checks if 17%3 is 0, which it's not. Then the loop ends, and returns True, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 25? The square root is 5, but since we are using i up to sqrt(n), i=3, then 5? Wait, 3 squared is 9, 5 squared is 25. So if n is 25, in the loop when i is 3, 25%3 is 1, so no. Next, i increments by 2 to 5. Then 25%5 is 0, so it returns False correctly.\n\nWait, but wait. When I calculate the sqrt(n), for 25 it is 5. So when the loop is i=5, is that included? Because in the loop, I usually loop while i <= sqrt_n. So I think the condition should be i <= sqrt_n, not just less than.\n\nSo let me make sure. The loop variable would go from 3 to sqrt_n inclusive, stepping by 2 each time. But wait, no: because if sqrt_n is an integer, in the case where n is a perfect square, like 9, then 3 is included, and 9%3 is 0, so it's detected.\n\nBut in other cases, like n=25, the same applies.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the square root as an integer, and loop from 3 to that integer, inclusive, but only if the integer is odd. Or wait, more accurately, perhaps for n, compute the square root, and loop through possible divisors up to that square root.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to compute the maximum possible divisor as the integer part of the square root of n, and then check divisors up to that. But in code, it's done via a variable sqrt_n, which is int(n ** 0.5). Hmm, but n could be a perfect square, so adding 1 sometimes? Or not. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, in code, whether to include or not depends on whether sqrt_n is integer. For example, for n=25, sqrt_n is 5, which is an integer. So in the loop, i should go up to and including 5. But since 5 is n's square root, it's necessary.\n\nBut in the code, suppose I have i ranging up to sqrt_n, but with i taking on values 3,5, etc. Wait, no. The way the code is set up, perhaps I should handle it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. For the loop, we can handle i starting from 3, then we check whether n is divisible by i. If yes, return False. If the loop ends and no divisors are found, return True.\n\nSo let me outline the code.\n\nFirst, check if n < 2: return False.\n\nThen, check if n is 2 or 3: return True.\n\nThen, check if n is even (n % 2 == 0), return False.\n\nThen, loop through odd numbers starting at 3 up to sqrt_n (inclusive), and check for divisibility.\n\nWait, but to handle the square root correctly, perhaps the loop condition should check while i <= sqrt_n. So let's write it more concretely.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n in (2,3):\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5) + 1  # Adding 1 to include the integer part\n    for i in range(3, sqrt_n, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, but let's test this code.\n\nTest case 1: n=9.\n\nsqrt_n = 3, adding 1 makes it 4. So the range is from 3 to 4, but the step is 2, so the loop runs for i=3. 9%3==0\u2192 return False. Correct.\n\nTest case 2: n=25.\n\nsqrt(25) is 5. Adding 1 makes sqrt_n=6. The range is from 3, to 6, step 2. So i=3,5.\n\nAt i=3: 25%3 is 1. Continue.\n\ni=5: 25%5=0\u2192 return False. Correct.\n\nTest case 3: n=7.\n\nsqrt_7 is approx 2.64. int(2.64) is 2. Adding 1 makes it 3.\n\nSo the range is from 3 to 3. Since it's not inclusive in the upper bound, the loop doesn't run. So it returns True. Correct.\n\nWait, because in the range function, range(start, stop, step) goes up to stop-1. So in this code, for n=3, the range is 3 to 3, which doesn't run the loop. So the function returns True, which is correct because 3 is a prime.\n\nWait, but in the code, when n=3, we have the condition that if n in (2,3): return True. So the loop isn't even reached.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. sqrt(5)=~2.236\u2192 int is 2\u2192 add 1\u21923. So the loop is i in range(3,3,2)\u2192 no iterations. So returns True. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=15.\n\nsqrt(15)=~3.87\u2192 int is 3\u2192 add 1\u21924.\n\nLoop runs from 3 to 4, step 2. So i=3.\n\n15%3==0 \u2192 returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=49 (7x7). sqrt(49)=7. int is 7. add 1\u21928.\n\nLoop from 3 to 8, step 2: i=3,5,7.\n\ni=7: 49%7==0\u2192 returns False.\n\nAnother test: n=17. sqrt is ~4.123\u2192 int 4\u2192 add 1\u21925.\n\nLoop runs i=3.\n\n17%3 is 2, so loop ends, returns True.\n\nGood.\n\nWait, but what about n=4? The function checks for even, returns False. Correct.\n\nn=6: even\u2192 returns False. Correct.\n\nn=1: returns False.\n\nn=2: returns True.\n\nOkay, seems like the code handles these cases well. So the code checks all possible divisors up to square root, skipping even numbers by starting at 3 and incrementing by 2, thus checking only odd divisors.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? The first condition handles it. Correct.\n\nNow, is there any corner case that this code might miss? Let's think. What about n=0 or negative numbers? The first condition n <2 catches them, returns False.\n\nWhat about very large primes, like n=9973? The code would check up to sqrt(9973)= about 99.8, so loop up to 99, checking 3,5,...,99. Since 9973 is a prime, no divisors are found, and returns True.\n\nWhat about if n is a product of two primes, both larger than sqrt(n)? Like n=11*11=121. Since sqrt(121)=11, which is included in the loop, so when i=11, 121%11=0\u2192 returns False. Correct.\n\nSo I think the code is solid. Now, write this as the function.\n\nWait a second: in the loop, the step is 2. So in the code, for i in range(3, sqrt_n, 2). The range(3, sqrt_n, 2) would run i=3,5,7,... up to the largest number less than sqrt_n. But because we added 1 to sqrt_n, let me see: for example, sqrt_n was 4 for n=9, which is 3. So 3 vs 4 in the range.\n\nWait, let me think. For n=9, square root is 3. So sqrt_n after adding 1 is 4. The range is from 3 to 4, step 2. So i runs 3. Correct.\n\nFor n=25, sqrt is 5. add 1\u21926. range(3,6,2) is 3,5. So correct.\n\nAnother example: n=15. sqrt is 3.872, so int is 3 plus 1 is 4. range(3,4,2) is only 3. Correct.\n\nWhat if n is 27, which is 3^3. The square root is 5.196, int is 5. add 1\u21926. So i would be 3,5. Testing 3 in the first step: 27%3=0, returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=35. Square root is 5.916, int is 5 +1 =6. range(3,6,2)\u21923,5.\n\n35%3 is 2, then i=5: 35%5=0\u2192 return False.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWait, but wait: in the code, I have for i in range(3, sqrt_n, 2). Because of the way range works in Python, does this work correctly when sqrt_n is even or odd? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me test with even sqrt_n.\n\nFor example, n=49, which is 7^2=49. Wait n=49's sqrt is 7, int is 7, plus 1 is 8.\n\nSo range(3,8,2) is 3,5,7. So it correctly checks 7.\n\nAnother case, suppose n=121 (11x11). The sqrt is 11, added 1 is 12. So range(3,12,2): 3,5,7,9,11. So 11 is in the loop. Correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle the loops correctly.\n\nWait, but another edge case: n=4. It's even, function detects it correctly. Yes.\n\nn=5: it's a prime. After checking, loop doesn't run, returns True.\n\nSo yes, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? It returns False. That's correct because primes are >1.\n\nn=0: returns False.\n\nn=-5: returns False.\n\nI think the code is solid.\n\nSo to write the function correctly, the steps are:\n\n1. If n is less than 2, return False.\n\n2. If n is 2 or 3, return True.\n\n3. If n is even (n%2 ==0), return False.\n\n4. Otherwise, compute sqrt_n as int(n ** 0.5) +1.\n\n5. For each i in 3,5,7,... up to sqrt_n:\n\n   a. If i divides n, return False.\n\n6. If no divisors found, return True.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be as follows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Check Small Values**: If the number is less than 2, it is not prime. If it's 2 or 3, it is prime.\n2. **Check Even Numbers**: If the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.\n3. **Check Odd Divisors**: For numbers greater than 3, check if they have any odd divisors up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.\n\nHere's how the code implements these steps:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Determines if a given number n is a prime number.\n    Returns True if n is a prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n in (2, 3):\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5) + 1\n    for i in range(3, sqrt_n, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n- **Lines 3-5**: Check for numbers less than 2, and return `False`. Check if the number is 2 or 3, and return `True`.\n- **Line 6**: If the number is even and greater than 2, return `False`.\n- **Line 7**: Calculate the square root of `n` to limit the range of divisors to check.\n- **Lines 8-10**: Loop through odd numbers up to the calculated square root. If any number divides `n` evenly, `n` is not prime.\n\nThis method efficiently determines primality by reducing the number of checks needed through mathematical insights.",
