  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to write a Python function called is_prime that determines if a given number n is a prime number. Hmm, let's think about what a prime number is. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. So, the function should return True if the number is prime and False otherwise.\n\nOkay, but how do I check if a number is prime? Well, the most straightforward way is to try dividing it by all integers from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any of those divisions result in a whole number, then it's not a prime. Otherwise, it is a prime.\n\nWait, why the square root? Oh right, because if a number n has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, so we would have already found it. So checking up to sqrt(n) is sufficient, which makes the function more efficient.\n\nSo, the function should handle edge cases first. For example, if n is less than 2, it's not a prime. So, in that case, the function should immediately return False.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if n is less than 2. If yes, return False.\n2. Check if n is 2. 2 is the smallest prime number, so return True.\n3. If n is even (divisible by 2), it's not prime, so return False.\n4. Now, loop from 3 to sqrt(n), checking only odd numbers since even divisors were already handled.\n5. If any of these numbers divide n evenly, return False.\n6. If none divide n, return True.\n\nWait, why are we skipping even numbers after checking 2? Because if n is even, we've already handled that case. So checking all even numbers again would be redundant and time-consuming.\n\nSo, the loop should start at 3 and go up to sqrt(n), increment by 2 each time to skip even numbers. This will make it more efficient.\n\nLet me also think about how to implement the loop. I can use a for loop that starts at 3, increments by 2, and goes up to the integer value of sqrt(n). For each i in this range, check if n % i == 0. If yes, return False.\n\nWait, how do I compute sqrt(n) in Python? Oh right, I can use the math.sqrt() function, but I need to import the math module first. Also, since we're dealing with integers, I should probably convert the sqrt to an integer using int() or math.floor().\n\nYes, so the loop would look like:\nfor i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n\nWait, why +1? Because range is exclusive of the end, so to include the square root, I add 1.\n\nBut wait, math.sqrt returns a float, and when I take int of it, it truncates. For example, if the sqrt is 4.9, int would make it 4. But I want to include 4 as the last number to check. So adding 1 is correct to include the integer part.\n\nWait, no, let's see: if the number is 25, sqrt(25) is 5. So range would be from 3 up to 5, inclusive. So in that case, it's correct because 5 is included. If n is 26, sqrt is a bit over 5 (5.099), int would be 5, and adding 1 makes the end 6, so i would go up to 5, as 6 is excluded.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst, import math.\n\nThen, handle the cases where n is less than 2: return False.\n\nIf n is 2, return True.\n\nIf n is even (n % 2 == 0), return False.\n\nThen, for i from 3 to sqrt(n) inclusive, step 2:\nif any i divides n without remainder, return False.\n\nIf all these fail, return True.\n\nLet me think about testing it with some numbers.\n\nFor example, n=2: returns True.\n\nn=3: check i from 3 to sqrt(3) ~1.732, int is 1, so the range is 3 to 1+1=2, step 2. Well, that's range(3,2,2), which doesn't execute, so returns True.\n\nn=4: it's even, so returns False.\n\nn=5: not even, loop i=3 to sqrt(5)~2.236, int is 2, adding 1 makes 3. So the range is 3 to 3 (since 2+1=3), step2: i=3. Since 5%3 is 2, no return. So function returns True.\n\nn=9: sqrt(9)=3. So i=3, but 9%3=0 \u2192 returns False.\n\nn=15: sqrt(15) ~3.872, int is 3, so loop runs for i=3. 15%3 is 0 \u2192 returns False.\n\nn=17: check up to 4 (since 4^2=16 <17, 5^2=25>17). So i=3 and 5.\n\nWait, no. sqrt(17) is ~4.123, int is 4, adding 1 makes 5. So the loop goes from 3 to 5 (since range is exclusive of the end), step 2. So i=3,5?\n\nWait, no. The first parameter is 3, second is 5. So the loop will include 3 and 5? Wait, 3, next is 3+2=5, which is less than 5? No, because 5 is the end, which is exclusive. So i=3, and the loop stops.\n\nWait, no, let me make sure.\n\nrange(start, end, step): includes start, increases by step until the next would be >= end.\n\nSo for range(3,5,2): 3 is included, next is 5, which is equal to end, so stop. So the loop only runs once, for i=3.\n\nSo for 17, i=3. 17%3 is 2. No divisor. Then, 17's next possible divisor is 5, which is 17%5= 2. But since 5^2=25>17, the loop stops after checking 3. So the function returns True, which is correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, for numbers like 25:\n\nsqrt(25) is 5. So i runs from 3 to 5+1=6. Because range(3,6,2) includes 3,5. So 3, then 5.\n\nAt i=5: 25%5==0 \u2192 returns False. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=7: sqrt(7) ~2.64, int 2, plus 1 is 3. So loop from 3 to 3. So i=3. 7%3 is 1, so function returns True.\n\nWait, but 3 is bigger than sqrt(7), which is ~2.64. So why are we checking 3?\n\nWait, because for n=7, sqrt(n) is about 2.64. So looping from 3 to 3 (since 2+1=3, and range(3,3,2) doesn't execute. So loop doesn't run at all.\n\nWait no, let me correct this: in the case of n=7, the loop would run as follows:\n\nsqrt(7) is about 2.6458, so int of that is 2, add 1 \u21923. So the loop is from 3 to 3 (since range excludes the end), step 2. So the range is 3 but since 3 is end is 3, no iterations occur. So loop doesn't run.\n\nHence, returns True. Which is correct.\n\nSo in that case, the loop only runs when i starts below the end. So I think this setup is correct.\n\nBut wait, when n=9: sqrt(9)=3, so loop runs from 3 to 4 (3+1=4), step 2 \u2192 i=3. 9%3=0 \u2192 returns False.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about numbers with factors beyond that? Like n=199: a prime.\n\nWait, sqrt(199) is ~14.1. So loop from 3 to 15 (14.1 \u2192 int is 14, +1=15). So i runs 3,5,7,9,11,13.\n\nEach step: 199 is not divisible by any of them, so returns True.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nImport math at the beginning.\n\nThen, handle the less than 2 case.\n\nif n < 2:\n    return False\n\nif n == 2:\n    return True\n\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    return False\n\nThen, loop i from 3 to sqrt(n), inclusive, step 2.\n\nfor i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) +1, 2):\n    if n % i ==0:\n        return False\n\nAfter the loop, return True.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? The first condition handles it, returns False.\n\nWhat about n=3?\n\nn=3: less than 2: no. n is 2? No. n%2 ==0: 3%2=1 \u2192 no. Then loop:\n\nsqrt(3) is ~1.732, int is 1, +1=2. So loop is from 3 to 2, step 2: since 3>2, loop doesn't run. returns True. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=5: loop runs from 3 to 2 (since sqrt(5) ~2.236, int is 2, +1=3. So range(3,3,2) doesn't run. returns True.\n\nSo the function should be correct.\n\nI think that's a solid plan.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if a given number \\( n \\) is a prime number, we can follow an efficient approach that checks for factors up to the square root of \\( n \\). This optimizes the process by reducing the number of checks needed, especially for larger numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - Numbers less than 2 are not prime.\n   - The number 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.\n   - All other even numbers are not prime.\n\n2. **Check for Factors**:\n   - For numbers greater than 2 and odd, check divisibility starting from 3 up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n   - Increment by 2 to skip even numbers, as even factors have already been ruled out.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**:\n   - If \\( n \\) is less than 2, return `False` immediately.\n   - If \\( n \\) is exactly 2, return `True` as it is the only even prime number.\n   - If \\( n \\) is even and greater than 2, return `False`.\n\n2. **Loop for Odd Factors**:\n   - Start checking from 3 and only consider odd numbers up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n   - Use the `range` function with a step of 2 to skip even numbers, improving efficiency.\n   - If any number in this range divides \\( n \\) without a remainder, \\( n \\) is not prime, so return `False`.\n\n3. **Return Result**:\n   - If no factors are found in the loop, return `True`, indicating \\( n \\) is a prime number.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the number of checks by leveraging mathematical properties of prime numbers, ensuring optimal performance.",
