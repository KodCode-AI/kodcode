  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how to create a function called filter_even_numbers that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with only the odd numbers. So the task is to go through each number in the input list, check if it's odd, and if it is, include it in the new list.\n\nHmm, wait, the function is named filter_even_numbers, but the docstring says it returns only the odd numbers. That seems a bit confusing because the name suggests it's filtering even numbers, but the actual functionality is for odds. Maybe that's a mistake or perhaps intentional. Well, I'll proceed based on the docstring since it explicitly states the return of odd numbers.\n\nSo, I'll start by writing a list comprehension that iterates over each number in the input list 'numbers'. For each number, I'll check if it's odd by using the modulus operator. If a number modulo 2 doesn't equal zero, it's odd. So the condition would be 'num % 2 != 0'.\n\nLet me think about some test cases to make sure this works. For example, if the input is [1,2,3,4,5], the output should be [1,3,5]. What if the list is empty? Then it should return an empty list, which the comprehension handles gracefully. What about negative numbers? Well, modulus works the same way in Python for negatives, so -3 % 2 is 1, which is not zero, so it's included. That's correct.\n\nAnother test case: numbers like [0, 1, -1]. The function should include 1 and -1 because both are odd, and exclude 0 because it's even. So the returned list should be [1, -1].\n\nI should also make sure that the function correctly handles the type hints. The input is a List[int], and the output is also a List[int], so that should be fine.\n\nWait, the function name is filter_even_numbers, but it's returning odds. That could be a point of confusion for anyone reading the code. Maybe it's better to rename the function to filter_odd_numbers to make it clear, but the problem says to define filter_even_numbers, so I have to stick with the given name.\n\nIn conclusion, the function will iterate through each number, check if it's odd, and collect those in a new list using a list comprehension. The list comprehension is concise and efficient for this purpose.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that filters and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the given input list of integers. The function will iterate through each number, check if it is odd, and include it in the resulting list if it meets the condition.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using a list comprehension to efficiently filter out the odd numbers from the input list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Iterate through each number**: For each number in the input list, we check whether the number is odd.\n2. **Check for odd numbers**: A number is considered odd if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero. This can be checked using the condition `num % 2 != 0`.\n3. **List comprehension**: Using a list comprehension, we create a new list that includes only the numbers that satisfy the odd condition. This is a concise and efficient way to create the filtered list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is odd by evaluating `num % 2 != 0`. If true, the number is included in the resulting list.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because list comprehensions in Python are optimized for such operations, making the solution both concise and performant.\n- **Type Handling**: The function correctly handles various integer inputs, including negative numbers and zero, ensuring that only odd numbers are included in the output.\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that the function works correctly for all valid input cases, providing a clear and efficient solution to the problem.",
