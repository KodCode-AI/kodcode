  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that counts how many times a specific character appears in a string. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nWell, I remember that in Python, strings can be iterated over, so maybe I can loop through each character in the string and check if it matches the target character. Each time it does, I'll increment a counter.\n\nWait, so I should initialize a counter variable to 0 first. Then, for each character in the string, if the character equals the target, add 1 to the counter. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I think Python has a built-in method for this. Oh right, the count() method of strings returns the number of occurrences of a substring. But since we're dealing with a single character, that should work too. So for a string s, s.count(char) would give the number.\n\nIs there a difference in efficiency between these two methods? I think the built-in method is probably more efficient because it's implemented in C under the hood. So using the count method would be better, especially for longer strings.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects me to write it manually, as an exercise. Well, the question didn't specify, so I can offer both versions.\n\nWait, the user asked for a function, so I need to define a function that takes two parameters: the string and the character. Let's say the function is called count_char. So it would be something like def count_char(s, char):.\n\nIf I use the count method, the function can be just one line: return s.count(char). But perhaps I should handle the case where the character is not in the string, but the count method handles that by returning 0, so I don't need to do anything extra.\n\nLet me think about possible test cases. For example, if the string is \"hello\" and the char is 'l', it should return 2. What if the string is empty? It should return 0, which it does.\n\nAre there any edge cases? Like if the string has uppercase and lowercase letters. But since the function is case-sensitive by default, 'L' and 'l' would count differently. That's correct as per normal behavior.\n\nSo writing the function using the count method seems straightforward and efficient. But if I were to write it manually, I might loop through each character and count. Let me see how that would look.\n\nInitialize a counter to 0. Then loop through each char in s: if char == target_char, increment counter. Finally, return the counter. That's easy enough.\n\nSo the function could be written either way. But since the count method is concise and efficient, using it would be better.\n\nI think that's all. So the function can be as simple as returning the count using the built-in method.\n</think>\n\nTo count the number of times a specific character appears in a string, we can utilize Python's built-in string method `count()`, which provides a concise and efficient solution.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n\n```python\ndef count_char(s, char):\n    return s.count(char)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Parameters:** The function `count_char` takes two parameters: `s` (the string to search) and `char` (the character to count).\n- **Return Value:** It returns an integer representing the number of times `char` appears in `s`.\n- **Efficiency:** The `count()` method is efficient as it's implemented in C, making it suitable even for longer strings.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nprint(count_char(\"hello\", \"l\"))  # Output: 2\nprint(count_char(\"hello\", \"x\"))  # Output: 0\nprint(count_char(\"\", \"a\"))       # Output: 0\n```",
