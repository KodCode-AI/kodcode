  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function to merge two dictionaries. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe goal is to combine the two dictionaries such that if a key exists in both, their values are summed. If a key is only in one dictionary, it should be included as is in the result.\n\nFirst, I'll start by initializing an empty dictionary to hold the merged result. Let's call it merged_dict.\n\nNow, I should consider all the keys from both input dictionaries. One way is to loop through each key in the first dictionary, add it to merged_dict, and then do the same for the second dictionary. But I have to handle the case where keys are present in both.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to create a new dictionary that includes all keys from both. So I can loop through each key in the first dictionary and add it to merged_dict. Then, I'll do the same for the second dictionary, but if the key already exists, I'll sum the values.\n\nBut that might miss keys that are only in the second dictionary. Hmm, perhaps I should get all unique keys from both dictionaries first. Alternatively, I can iterate over both dictionaries, and for each key, check if it's already in merged_dict. If yes, sum the values; if no, set it.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize merged_dict as empty.\n2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the first dictionary.\n3. For each key, add the key to merged_dict with its value.\n4. Then, iterate over each key-value pair in the second dictionary.\n5. For each key, if it's already in merged_dict, add the value to the existing value.\n6. If it's not in merged_dict, set the key with its value.\n\nBut wait, step 3 could be part of the same process as step 4 and 5. Alternatively, I can combine the steps. Maybe it's better to handle all keys from both dictionaries.\n\nAnother way is to create a set of all keys from both dictionaries. Then, for each key in this set, check if it exists in the first and/or second dictionary and sum accordingly. But that might be more efficient.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Create a new set containing all keys from both dict1 and dict2.\n- For each key in this set:\n   - Initialize the sum for this key as 0.\n   - If the key is in dict1, add its value to the sum.\n   - If the key is in dict2, add its value to the sum.\n   - Set merged_dict[key] to this sum.\n\nThis way, if a key is in both, their values are summed. If it's only in one, the sum is just that value.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = {}\n    # Get all unique keys\n    keys = set(dict1.keys()) | set(dict2.keys())\n    for key in keys:\n        sum_value = 0\n        if key in dict1:\n            sum_value += dict1[key]\n        if key in dict2:\n            sum_value += dict2[key]\n        merged_dict[key] = sum_value\n    return merged_dict\n\nWait, but what if the values are not integers? Like if they are other data types. Well, the problem statement didn't specify, so I assume they are numeric.\n\nAnother approach could be to create a copy of the first dictionary, then update it by adding the second dictionary's values. For example, using a loop over the second dictionary:\n\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        if key in merged_dict:\n            merged_dict[key] += value\n        else:\n            merged_dict[key] = value\n    return merged_dict\n\nWait, is this approach correct? Let's see.\n\nIf I copy dict1 into merged_dict, then iterate through dict2. For each key in dict2, if it's already in merged_dict (from dict1), sum the values. Else, add it. This seems to cover both cases. Because for keys only in dict2, they are added, and for keys in both, their values are summed.\n\nYes, this approach is simpler and perhaps more efficient because it doesn't require creating a set of all keys, but just using the existing keys from dict2.\n\nSo which approach is better? Both should work, but the second approach might be more efficient as it avoids creating the set of all keys and looping through each key, especially if the dictionaries are large.\n\nSo implementing the second approach might be better.\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\ndict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\ndict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\nAfter merge, merged_dict should be {'a':1, 'b':5, 'c':4}.\n\nUsing the second approach:\nmerged_dict starts as {'a':1, 'b':2}\nThen, for dict2:\nkey 'b' is in merged_dict, so 2 +3=5\nkey 'c' is not, so add 4.\nResult: correct.\n\nExample 2:\ndict1 = {'x': 10}\ndict2 = {'y': 20}\nMerged should have both keys with their values.\n\nWith the approach, after copying, add 'y':20. Correct.\n\nAnother example where the same key exists in both:\n\ndict1 = {'a':5}\ndict2 = {'a':5}\nMerged should have 'a':10.\n\nYes, according to the code.\n\nWhat about empty dictionaries?\n\ndict1 is empty, dict2 is empty: merged is empty.\n\ndict1 is empty, dict2 has values: merged should have dict2's values.\n\ndict1 has values, dict2 is empty: merged should have dict1's.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach should handle all cases.\n\nI think the second approach is better because it's simpler and efficient. So I'll implement that.\n\nNow, considering possible edge cases:\n\n- Values can be zero. But since we're summing, it should still work.\n\n- What if a value is a float? The addition should work as well.\n\nSo the code should handle all numeric types.\n\nThus, the final function will be written using the second approach.\n</think>\n\nTo merge two dictionaries such that if a key exists in both, their values are summed, and if a key only exists in one dictionary, it is included as is, you can use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):\n    merged_dict = dict1.copy()\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        if key in merged_dict:\n            merged_dict[key] += value\n        else:\n            merged_dict[key] = value\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Copy the First Dictionary:** Start by creating a copy of the first dictionary (`dict1`). This ensures that all key-value pairs from `dict1` are included in the result.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Second Dictionary:** Loop through each key-value pair in the second dictionary (`dict2`).\n\n3. **Check for Existing Keys:** For each key in `dict2`, check if it already exists in the copied dictionary (`merged_dict`):\n   - If the key exists, add the value from `dict2` to the existing value in `merged_dict`.\n   - If the key does not exist, add the key-value pair from `dict2` to `merged_dict`.\n\n4. **Return the Merged Dictionary:** After processing all key-value pairs from `dict2`, return the merged dictionary which now contains the combined results.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both cases where keys are present in both dictionaries or only in one, ensuring the correct summation or inclusion of values.",
