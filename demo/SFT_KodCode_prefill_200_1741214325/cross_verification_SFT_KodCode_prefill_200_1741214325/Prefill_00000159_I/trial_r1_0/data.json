  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function that reverses a string without using extra space. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in Python, strings are immutable, so modifying them in place isn't straightforward. But wait, maybe I can convert the string into a list because lists are mutable.\n\nLet me think about the steps. First, I'll take the input string and convert it into a list of characters. Then, I can use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and the other at the end. I'll swap the characters at these pointers and move towards the center.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So for example, if the string is \"hello\", the list would be ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']. The first pointer is at 0, the last at 4. Swap them: 'h' and 'o' swap places. Then move the left pointer to 1 and the right to 3. Swap 'e' and 'l'. Then the pointers meet in the middle, and I stop.\n\nSince we're doing this in place with just a few variables for the pointers and temporary swaps, the space complexity should be O(1), which fits the requirement.\n\nSo putting it all together, I'll write a function called reverse_string. The function takes a string as input. I'll convert it to a list, then loop with left and right pointers. In each iteration, I'll swap the characters. Finally, I'll join the list back into a string and return it.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example. Let's say the input is \"test\". The list becomes ['t', 'e', 's', 't']. Left=0, right=3: swap 't' and 't'\u2014no change. Left moves to 1, right to 2: swap 'e' and 's', resulting in ['t', 's', 'e', 't']. Join gives \"tset\", which is reversed.\n\nAnother test with odd length, like \"abcde\". The list is ['a','b','c','d','e']. Left=0, right=4: swap 'a' and 'e' becomes ['e','b','c','d','a']. Left=1, right=3: swap 'b' and 'd' resulting in ['e','d','c','b','a']. So reversed string is \"edcba\", which is correct.\n\nWait, but in Python, strings are immutable, so each swap within the list shouldn't take extra space beyond the list itself. The function doesn't create any other data structures that scale with the input size, so yes, it should be O(1) space.\n\nI think that covers the logic. Now I just need to write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo reverse a string without using extra space, we can utilize an in-place approach by converting the string into a list of characters and swapping the characters symmetrically from both ends towards the center.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert the String to a List:** Since strings in Python are immutable, we convert the string into a list of characters to allow in-place modifications.\n2. **Two-Pointer Technique:** We use two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning (index 0) and `right` from the end (index length - 1) of the list.\n3. **Swap Characters:** In each iteration, swap the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers and then move `left` forward and `right` backward until they meet or cross each other.\n4. **Reconstruct the String:** After reversing the list, join the characters back into a string and return it.\n\nThis method ensures that we only use a few extra variables (pointers and temporary swap variables) and thus operates in constant O(1) space.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    # Convert the string to a list to allow in-place modifications\n    s_list = list(s)\n    left = 0\n    right = len(s_list) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        # Swap characters at left and right pointers\n        s_list[left], s_list[right] = s_list[right], s_list[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n    \n    # Join the list back into a string\n    return ''.join(s_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to List:** The string is converted into a list to facilitate in-place swaps.\n2. **Pointer Initialization:** `left` starts at the beginning (0), and `right` starts at the end (length - 1).\n3. **Swapping Loop:** While `left` is less than `right`, swap the characters at these indices and adjust the pointers towards the center.\n4. **String Reconstruction:** The modified list is joined back into a string, which is the reversed version of the input.\n\nThis approach efficiently reverses the string in-place with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.",
