  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to write a function called merge_sorted_lists that takes two sorted lists as arguments, lst1 and lst2, and merges them into a single sorted list. The examples given show that it should return a new sorted list combining both input lists. The function should leverage the heapq.merge function because that's what the problem statement suggests.\n\nHmm, okay, I remember that heapq is a Python module that provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. The heapq.merge function is used to merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output. It's efficient because it's designed to work on iterables without reading them all into memory at once, which is good for large datasets. But for this problem, the lists are manageable.\n\nWait, wait, so if I pass lst1 and lst2 to heapq.merge, it should return an iterator that yields the sorted values one by one. But the function is supposed to return a list, not an iterator. So I'll have to convert that iterator into a list.\n\nSo the plan is: I'll import heapq, then use heapq.merge with lst1 and lst2. Then, I can iterate over the merged result and convert it into a list.\n\nWait, no, actually, I can just pass the results of heapq.merge to list(). Because list() will take the iterator and consume it, appending each element to create a list.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Import heapq if it's not already done. But in the function, since it's a module, I need to make sure it's imported. However, since the function is part of a Python script, I can assume that the import is done outside the function.\n\nWait, in Python, you can't have an import inside a function. The import statement is a module-level statement. So I need to import heapq at the top, before the function.\n\nBut here, since the problem shows code without the import, perhaps I should include it inside the function. Or is that even allowed? Let me think. No, Python doesn't allow import statements inside function definitions. So, I have to import heapq at the top of the code.\n\nBut when the function is written, it's going to rely on heapq.merge. So the first step is to have an import statement for heapq.\n\nWait, but the problem's starter code doesn't include the import yet. So in my solution, I need to make sure I handle that.\n\nSo the function will look something like this:\n\nImport heapq outside the function definition.\n\nThen, define the function:\n\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # use heapq.merge and convert it to a list\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. Because the merge function returns an iterator, right? So the list() call will go through all the elements and create the list.\n\nI should also consider the other approach without using heapq, but since the problem explicitly mentions using heapq.merge, it's better to use it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to not use heapq, I could have written my own loop that takes elements from each list in order, similar to the merge step in merge sort, but that's less efficient and more error-prone. So using the built-in function is better.\n\nNow, considering some test cases.\n\nFor example:\n\nTest case 1:\nmerge_sorted_lists([1,3,5], [2,4,6]) should return [1,2,3,4,5,6]. So heapq.merge should correctly interleave them.\n\nTest case 2:\nBoth empty lists return an empty list. The merge function would return an empty iterator, so list() returns an empty list.\n\nTest case 3:\nMerge [1,3,3] and [2,3,4] to get [1,2,3,3,3,4]. When using heapq.merge, it should properly merge the duplicates.\n\nAnother test case with negative numbers:\nmerge_sorted_lists([-2, 0, 2], [-3, 1, 3]) returns [-3, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3].\n\nAnd when two identical lists are merged, like [1,2,3] each, the result is [1,1,2,2,3,3].\n\nWhat about when one list is longer than the other? Like [1,3,5,7] and [2,4,6] should become [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The heapq.merge should handle that.\n\nI think this function should meet all these cases. So, the implementation is straightforward.\n\nNow, let me write the code.\n\nFirst, I'll need to import heapq.\n\nWait, but looking at the code skeleton provided in the problem, the function is defined without any imports. So in the final code, I should include the import statement at the top.\n\nBut in a setup like this, perhaps each function is in a module. So I should include 'import heapq' before the function.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe code will be:\n\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n\nWait, but what if the lists are not sorted? Oh, the problem states that both lists are already sorted, so the function just needs to merge them, and heapq.merge expects the inputs to be sorted. So in this problem, it's assumed that the inputs are sorted, so the function works correctly.\n\nTherefore, this function should handle all the cases correctly.\n\nWait, but let me test it on one of the examples.\n\nFor example, >>> merge_sorted_lists([1,3,5], [2,4,6]) should give [1,2,3,4,5,6]. So the function, when given these, runs heapq.merge(lst1, lst2), which is the same as the example, and then converting to a list gives the desired output.\n\nYes, it works.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the function uses list, which is a standard function that can take any iterator. Since heapq.merge returns an iterator, this is handled correctly.\n\nSo I think this is a solid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list efficiently. The goal is to leverage Python's `heapq.merge` function, which is designed to merge multiple sorted iterables into a single sorted output efficiently.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using the `heapq.merge` function from Python's `heapq` module. This function efficiently merges sorted iterables without reading all elements into memory at once, making it suitable for handling large datasets. Since `heapq.merge` returns an iterator, we will convert this iterator into a list to get the desired output format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. **Import the heapq module**: This module provides the necessary functionality for merging sorted iterables.\n2. **Define the function**: The function `merge_sorted_lists` takes two parameters, both of which are sorted lists.\n3. **Merge the lists**: Use `heapq.merge` to merge the two sorted lists into a single sorted iterator.\n4. **Convert the iterator to a list**: Convert the resulting iterator from `heapq.merge` into a list and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code works as follows:\n1. **Importing the module**: `heapq` is imported to access the `merge` function.\n2. **Function definition**: `merge_sorted_lists` is defined to take two sorted lists as inputs.\n3. **Merging the lists**: `heapq.merge(lst1, lst2)` merges both sorted lists into a single sorted iterator.\n4. **Conversion to list**: The `list()` constructor converts the iterator returned by `heapq.merge` into a list, which is then returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently merges the two sorted lists into one sorted list, handling all edge cases, such as empty lists and duplicates, correctly. The use of `heapq.merge` ensures that the solution is both efficient and concise.",
