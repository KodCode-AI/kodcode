  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a function called merge_sorted_lists which takes two sorted lists as input and returns a single sorted list. The examples show that it works similarly to merging and sorting, but both inputs are already sorted.\n\nHmm, the problem says to use the heapq.merge function. Right, I remember that in Python's heapq module, there's a merge function that merges sorted inputs into a single sorted output. So the idea is to use that.\n\nFirst, I should import heapq at the top of my function. Wait, no, I just need to import heapq in the code. So I'll have to include that in the function or at the top of the script.\n\nWait, in Python, functions can't have imports inside them, I think. Oh right, imports are module-level, so I should import heapq outside of the function but inside the module. So I'll put 'import heapq' at the top.\n\nThen, the function will take lst1 and lst2. Now, how to use heapq.merge. Oh right, heapq.merge returns an iterator, so I have to convert it into a list.\n\nSo the steps for the function are:\n1. Import heapq.\n2. Check if either lst1 or lst2 is empty? Maybe not necessary, but let the merge function handle it.\n3. Use heapq.merge(lst1, lst2), but wait\u2014wait, no. Wait, in the examples given, it's merging two lists and returns a single sorted list as output, same as combining and sorting, but heapq.merge can handle it more efficiently.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that both lists are already sorted. So when they are both sorted, merging them can be done efficiently in linear time.\n\nSo in the function, I should call heapq.merge with lst1 and lst2 as arguments. So something like merged = heapq.merge(lst1, lst2), but that gives an iterator. So I need to convert that iterator into a list.\n\nSo the code should be something like: return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2)).\n\nLet me think about the cases.\n\nTest case 1: lst1 is [1,3,5], lst2 is [2,4,6]. The merged list is [1,2,3,4,5,6], which is correct.\n\nTest case 2: Both are empty lists: returns empty list, correct.\n\nTest case 3: [1,3,3] and [2,3,4] gives [1,2,3,3,3,4]. That works.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3], [1,2,3] gives two of each, same as sorted.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? Test case: [-2,0,2] and [-3,1,3] gives [-3,-2,0,1,2,3], which the function would produce.\n\nSo it seems the function will handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but wait: does heapq.merge use both lists as iterables? Yes, because lst1 and lst2 are lists, and merge can take any iterables.\n\nSo the code in the function is straightforward.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImport heapq at the top. Then, the function takes lst1 and lst2. It returns a list created from the merge.\n\nWait, but do I need to handle any edge cases that may not be handled by heapq.merge? Like, what if one of the lists is empty? Let's see: merge an empty list and another sorted list. It should just return the sorted list. And in the test case where both are empty, it returns empty. So, yes, it's handled.\n\nSo the function would look like this:\n\nimport heapq\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1, lst2):\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n\nTesting this with the given examples should work. So that's the code.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. Both input lists are already sorted, and we can leverage Python's `heapq` module to efficiently merge them in linear time.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using the `heapq.merge` function, which takes multiple sorted iterables and efficiently merges them into a single sorted iterator. This function works by comparing elements from each input and yielding the smallest one at each step, similar to the merge step in the merge sort algorithm.\n\nGiven that `heapq.merge` returns an iterator, we convert this iterator into a list before returning it. This ensures that the result is a list which is the merged and sorted version of the inputs.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Importing the Module**: We start by importing the `heapq` module, which provides the `merge` function.\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `merge_sorted_lists` is defined to take two parameters, both of which are lists of integers.\n3. **Using `heapq.merge`**: The `heapq.merge` function is called with the two input lists. This function efficiently merges the sorted lists into a single sorted iterator.\n4. **Conversion to List**: The resulting iterator from `heapq.merge` is converted into a list using the `list()` constructor.\n5. **Return Statement**: The merged and sorted list is returned as the output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the inputs are merged in linear time, making it an efficient solution for merging sorted lists.",
