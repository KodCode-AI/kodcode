  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function called merge_sorted_lists that takes two sorted lists of integers and merges them into a single sorted list. The examples given show that it uses the heapq.merge function. I remember that heapq.merge is a function that's used for merging multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output.\n\nWait, what exactly does heapq.merge do? I think it efficiently merges sorted iterables into one. But I should make sure. Oh right, when you have multiple sorted lists and you use heapq.merge, it returns an iterator that produces the elements in sorted order, without having to read all elements into memory at once. But the problem here says the function should return a list, so I'll need to convert that iterator into a list.\n\nSo the approach is to use heapq.merge on lst1 and lst2, then convert the result to a list. That should do it.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when one or both lists are empty? Like the second example where both are empty lists, should just return an empty list, which is handled since merging empty iterators would result in nothing, and converting to a list would be empty.\n\nTesting the third example, where one list has duplicates, like [1,3,3] and the other [2,3,4], the merged list should be [1,2,3,3,3,4], which the function should handle correctly because the lists are sorted individually, and heapq.merge would pick the smallest next element each time.\n\nSo the steps in the function are:\n\n1. Import heapq (but since it's a function I'm writing, maybe it's already imported as part of the environment.)\n2. Use heapq.merge(lst1, lst2) to create the merged iterator.\n3. Convert this iterator to a list and return it.\n\nSo the code inside the function would be:\n\nimport heapq\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n\nWait, but looking at the examples, let me see:\n\nIn the first example, lst1 is [1,3,5], lst2 is [2,4,6]. The merged list is [1,2,3,4,5,6], which the function would correctly produce.\n\nSimilarly for the other cases. So that should work.\n\nBut wait, what if someone passes unsorted lists? The function assumes they are already sorted, as per the docstring. So we don't need to handle that case.\n\nSo I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. The function should efficiently handle the merging process using an iterator-based approach to avoid high memory usage, especially with large input lists.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves using the `heapq.merge` function from Python's `heapq` module. This function is designed to merge multiple sorted iterables into a single sorted iterator. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Import the heapq module**: This provides the `merge` function necessary for the merging process.\n2. **Use heapq.merge**: This function takes the two sorted lists as input and returns an iterator that yields elements in sorted order.\n3. **Convert the iterator to a list**: Since the problem requires the output to be a list, we convert the iterator returned by `heapq.merge` into a list.\n\nThe `heapq.merge` function efficiently merges the sorted inputs by taking advantage of the fact that both inputs are already sorted, which allows it to use a more optimized merging strategy.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef merge_sorted_lists(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    return list(heapq.merge(lst1, lst2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Efficiency**: The function efficiently merges the two sorted lists using the `heapq.merge` function, which operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the total number of elements in both lists combined. This is because it only needs to iterate through each element once to merge them.\n- **Memory Usage**: By using an iterator, the function avoids constructing the entire merged list in memory until it is required, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets.\n- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles cases where one or both lists are empty, returning an empty list in such cases.\n\nThis approach ensures that the merged list maintains the sorted order with optimal efficiency.",
