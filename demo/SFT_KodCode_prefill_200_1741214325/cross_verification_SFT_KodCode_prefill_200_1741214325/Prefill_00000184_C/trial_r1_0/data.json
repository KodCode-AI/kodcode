  "r1_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to implement the quicksort algorithm for a list of integers. I remember that quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, so I should think in terms of breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems. \n\nThe function is called with an array, and it should return a sorted array in ascending order. Let me go through the examples given to understand the expected behavior.\n\nLooking at the first few examples:\n- quicksort([]) returns []\n- quicksort([5]) returns [5]\nThat makes sense because an empty array or a single-element array is already sorted.\n\nThe more complex examples, like [5,4,3,2,1], return a sorted array [1,2,3,4,5]. So I need to make sure that the algorithm correctly handles these cases.\n\nI recall that quicksort typically picks a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than, equal to, or greater than the pivot. Then it recursively sorts the sub-arrays and combines them.\n\nI should start by handling the base cases first. If the array is empty or has one element, I can return it as is. So the first part of my function can check if the length of the array is less than or equal to 1. If so, return the array.\n\nNext, I need to choose a pivot. The choice of pivot can affect the performance, but for simplicity, maybe I can choose the middle element, or maybe the first element. Alternatively, I could randomize the pivot selection to avoid worst-case scenarios, but for now, perhaps the middle element is a good start.\n\nWait, actually, for implementation simplicity in Python, picking the last element as the pivot might be easier. I think that's a common approach.\n\nOnce the pivot is selected, I need to partition the array into elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. Wait, or maybe just less than and greater than, and then collect the pivot(s) in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have three sections:\n- elements less than the pivot\n- elements equal to the pivot\n- elements greater than the pivot\n\nBecause this way, the equals can be handled correctly when there are duplicate elements.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n1. If the array has 0 or 1 element, return it.\n2. Choose a pivot (maybe the last element, or middle, etc.)\n3. Partition the array into three parts: those less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot.\n4. Recursively quicksort the less than and greater than parts.\n5. Combine the sorted less than part, the equals, and the sorted greater than part.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the base case is straightforward:\nif len(arr) <= 1:\n    return arr\n\nThen, select the pivot. Let's pick the middle element. So, for an array of length n, the pivot can be at position len(arr)//2. For example, in [1,2,3,4,5], the middle is 3, which is a good choice.\n\nBut in Python, accessing the middle index won't be a problem. So something like pivot = arr[len(arr)//2]\n\nWait, but for even lengths, this will pick the lower middle. Hmm, perhaps it's better to choose the middle index as (len(arr)-1)//2, but maybe it's not a big deal for the correctness\u2014just affects performance.\n\nAlternatively, choosing the last element as the pivot is easier, especially when dealing with the partitioning as in the Lomuto scheme. So I think I'll go with that for now.\n\nSo pivot = arr[-1]\n\nThen, I need to create three lists: left (elements < pivot), middle (elements == pivot), and right (elements > pivot).\n\nI can iterate through each element in arr, except the pivot, and append to left, middle, or right as appropriate.\n\nWait, but how to handle the pivot itself. After selecting it as the last element, I can exclude it from the iteration and then add it to the middle list in the partitioning step.\n\nLet's think of implementing it:\n\nleft = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < arr[-1]]\nmiddle = [x for x in arr if x == arr[-1]]\nright = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > arr[-1]]\n\nBut wait, when I process right, I should actually make sure it includes all elements except the last one that are greater. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to collect the left and right parts as elements less than and greater than the pivot, and middle is just a list containing the pivot (since it's selected once).\n\nWait, no. If the array has multiple elements equal to the pivot, the middle list will collect all of them. So in cases where the array has duplicates, like [3,6,8,10,1,2,1], the middle list will correctly capture all the 1s, etc.\n\nSo I think this approach is okay.\n\nThen, the function should return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right).\n\nPutting it together:\n\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\nWait, but in the right list, shouldn't it be x > pivot? Because when I take arr[:-1], which excludes the last element (the pivot), and then select elements greater than pivot.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this logic with one of the examples.\n\nTake the example [4,2,4,8,3,2]. According to the sample, the output should be [2,2,3,4,4,8].\n\nLet's see how this algorithm processes it.\n\nFirst, the array is [4,2,4,8,3,2].\n\nPivot is the last element, which is 2.\n\nleft is elements from [4,2,4,8,3] that are <2: only  elements? Let's see. 4 is not, 2 is equal, 4>2, 8>2, 3>2. So left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [2 (from the last element), but the other 2 is also in the array. Wait, no. Wait, the middle is [x for x in arr if x==pivot]. So since the array is [4,2,4,8,3,2], the elements equal to 2 are the second 2 and the last 2. So middle will be [2,2].\n\nright is elements from [4,2,4,8,3] that are >2: so 4,4,8,3.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\nOriginal arr is [4,2,4,8,3,2]. Without the last element, it's [4,2,4,8,3]. We take elements >2: 4,4,8,3. Note that 3 is >2. So right becomes [4,4,8,3].\n\nNow, the function returns quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right).\n\nLeft is empty, so returns [].\n\nQuicksort(right) will now process [4,4,8,3].\n\nBut before that, quicksort is called recursively.\n\nWait, let's see. So the function call is for the right list [4,4,8,3].\n\nWhen we call quicksort([4,4,8,3]):\n\nPivot is 3 (last element).\n\nleft is elements from [4,4,8] <3: none, so left is [].\n\nmiddle is elements ==3: which is the last 3. Wait, no, the array is [4,4,8,3], so the elements equal to 3 are just the last one. So middle is [3].\n\nright is elements from [4,4,8] >3: so 4,4,8.\n\nThus, in this step, the function will return [] + [3] + quicksort([4,4,8]).\n\nNow, quicksort([4,4,8]):\n\nPivot is 8.\n\nleft = [4,4], right is empty.\n\nmiddle is [8].\n\nSo quicksort([4,4]) will be [] (base case because after dividing, left may be [4] and right []? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, when processing [4,4], the pivot is 4 (last element). Left is elements <4: none. Middle is [4,4]. Right is elements >4: none.\n\nThus, quicksort([4,4,8]) returns quicksort([4,4]) + [8].\n\nquicksort([4,4]) returns [4,4] (left and right empty, base case). So quicksort([4,4,8]) returns [4,4,8].\n\nThus, the previous step returns [] + [3] + [4,4,8] = [3,4,4,8].\n\nWait, so going back, quicksort([4,4,8,3]) returns [] + [3] + [4,4,8] = [3,4,4,8].\n\nThen, back to our original function call, after the initial step, right was [4,4,8,3].\n\nWait, no\u2014the initial function was processing [4,2,4,8,3,2], pivot is 2, then right is [4,4,8,3]. Then quicksort(right) processes [4,4,8,3] and returns [3,4,4,8].\n\nSo combining everything: quicksort(left) is [], middle is [2,2], quicksort(right) is [3,4,4,8].\n\nSo the result is [] + [2,2] + [3,4,4,8] = [2,2,3,4,4,8], which matches the sample. So it works for this case.\n\nAnother test case: [5,4,3,2,1]. The quicksort would pick last element 1 as pivot. left will be [5,4,3,2], middle [1], right empty. Then it has to process [5,4,3,2].\n\nIn that recursive step, pivot is 2. left is [5,4,3], right empty. Middle [2].\n\nThen process [5,4,3], which again, last element 3, left [5,4], middle [3], right empty.\n\nThen process [5,4], last element 4. left [5], right empty. Middle [4]. So processing [5] returns it, so [5] + [4] + [] = [5,4].\n\nThen, in the [5,4,3] step: returns [5,4] + [3] \u2192 [5,4,3], wait, but that would be elements in the wrong order. Wait, no: wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, no: because the left is [5,4], then when you recursively quicksort left [5,4], which has length 2.\n\nIn quicksort([5,4]), pivot is 4. left is [5? no, 5 is greater than 4. So in this step, left is [x for x in [5] if x<4 \u2192 x=5 not <4. So left is empty. middle is [4]. right is [x for x in [5] if x>4 \u2192 [5]. So the result is quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right) \u2192 [] + [4] + quicksort([5]). Quicksort([5]) returns [5]. So the result for [5,4] is [4,5].\n\nSo in [5,4,3], the left after selecting 3 as the pivot is [5,4], which when sorted becomes [4,5]. Then, the middle is [3], so the combined result is [4,5] + [3] \u2192 [4,5,3]. Which isn't sorted. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, this suggests a problem in the algorithm. Because in this case, quicksort([5,4,3]) would return [4,5] + [3] \u2192 [4,5,3], but this isn't properly sorted.\n\nWait, this can't be because in quicksort, the partitioning should ensure that left is sorted and right is sorted. So where am I going wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic for gathering left and right is incorrect.\n\nWait, when I select a pivot, say the last element, then I split the remaining elements into left and right.\n\nIn the quicksort([5,4,3,2,1]), the first pivot is 1. Then left is [5,4,3,2], right is empty.\n\nThen quicksort([5,4,3,2]) will select 2 as pivot. So left is [5,4,3], which are elements before 2.\n\nWait, in that case, the function is QuickSort on the left, but then the left [5,4,3] is sorted into [3,4,5], but perhaps my code isn't doing that.\n\nWait, no. Let's see. When the function is called with [5,4,3,2,1], the first pivot is 1.\n\nThen left is [5,4,3,2], which will be passed to quicksort.\n\nIn the call quicksort([5,4,3,2]), the pivot is 2.\n\nLeft is [5,4,3], which is elements <2. So left is [5,4,3]? Wait, no: 5,4,3 are all greater than 2. So [x <2? No, so left is empty.\n\nMiddle is [2], and right is [5,4,3].\n\nThen quicksort(right) is called on [5,4,3], which then selects 3 as pivot.\n\nLeft is [5,4], right is empty, middle [3].\n\nThen quicksort([5,4]) would split into left = [], middle [4], right [5]. Then when combined, [4] + [5] \u2192 [4,5], which is correct.\n\nSo in the [5,4,3] call, quicksort(right) is quicksort([5,4]), which gives [4,5]. So the result of quicksort([5,4,3]) is quicksort(left) (which was [5,4] \u2192 [4,5]) + [3] \u2192 [4,5,3], which is not correct.\n\nWait, that suggests that the code as written is not correctly sorting.\n\nWait, why is that? Because in the code, for the [5,4,3] array, the pivot is 3.\n\nThe left is [5,4], which are elements <3? No, 5>3 and 4>3. So in the left, [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot] \u2192 x in [5,4], 5 and 4 are both >3, so left is empty.\n\nMiddle is [3], determined by [x ==3 for x in arr], which would include 3.\n\nRight is [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > 3], which is 5,4.\n\nSo when processing [5,4,3], the right is [5,4], the left is empty.\n\nThen the function returns quicksort(left) which is [] + [3] + quicksort([5,4]), which is [4,5]. So the total becomes [3] + [4,5] \u2192 [3,4,5], which is correct.\n\nWait, that suggests I made a mistake in my earlier mental calculation.\n\nWait, in the call to quicksort([5,4,3]):\n\nleft is empty.\n\nright is [5,4], and quicksort on [5,4] returns [4,5].\n\nSo the final result is [] + [3] + [4,5] = [3,4,5], which is correct.\n\nThus, going back, the processing for [5,4,3,2,1]:\n\nAfter the first step, quicksort([5,4,3,2]) is called with pivot 2.\n\nIts left is [5,4,3], but wait: no. Oh wait, wait, because in the case where the array is [5,4,3,2], the pivot is 2 (last element). Then left is [x for x in [5,4,3] if x <2 \u2192 no elements, so left is empty.\n\nMiddle is [2].\n\nRight is [x for x in [5,4,3] if x>2 \u2192 5,4,3. So right is [5,4,3]. Then quicksort(right) returns [3,4,5].\n\nSo the function call to quicksort([5,4,3,2]) returns [] (left) + [2] + [3,4,5] \u2192 [2,3,4,5].\n\nSo the original call, which had quicksort([5,4,3,2,1]) with pivot 1:\n\nquicksort(left [5,4,3,2]) returns [2,3,4,5], middle is [1], right is empty.\n\nSo the final result is [2,3,4,5] + [1] \u2192 [2,3,4,5,1], which is not correct.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Because in the function, the left is [5,4,3,2], and in the call quicksort([5,4,3,2]), the pivot is 2.\n\nBut in this case, left is elements before the pivot that are <2. Wait, no, the left is all elements except the last one (pivot 2), that are <2. But in [5,4,3,2] the elements are 5,4,3, which are all >2. So in this case, left is empty. Right is elements from [5,4,3] that are >2: which is 5,4,3.\n\nSo quicksort([5,4,3,2]) returns [] (quicksort left) + [2] + quicksort([5,4,3]). As before, quicksort([5,4,3]) returns [3,4,5] (wait, in the earlier step, determined that it would be [3,4,5], correct?), so combining, the call quicksort([5,4,3,2]) would be [2] + [3,4,5] \u2192 [2,3,4,5].\n\nWait, so then the function returns [2,3,4,5] + [1] ?\n\nWait, no: original array is [5,4,3,2,1], the function processes quicksort([5,4,3,2]) which returns [2,3,4,5], then appends [1] because middle is [1].\n\nWait, no. Because in the initial call, after selecting pivot 1, left is [5,4,3,2], right is empty. So the function returns quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right) \u2192 [2,3,4,5] + [1] + [] \u2192 [2,3,4,5,1], which is wrong.\n\nBut the sample expects [1,2,3,4,5] as the output.\n\nSo this suggests that there is a problem with the way the left and right are being chosen. Because the algorithm is appending the left sorted, then the middle, then the right sorted. But in this case, the left sorted is [2,3,4,5], the middle [1], that's added at the end.\n\nAh! So this is the problem. Because when the pivot is 1, and all the other elements are larger, the left is [5,4,3,2], which is being sorted into [2,3,4,5], and the middle is [1], but then the function concatenates them as left + middle + right (which is empty). So the result is [2,3,4,5,1], which is wrong.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in this case, [5,4,3,2,1] is being process with pivot 1, so the left is [5,4,3,2], right is empty. So the quicksort(left) is [2,3,4,5], which is correct. Then in the function, it's left (sorted) + middle (pivot and equals) + right (sorted), but in this case, [2,3,4,5] + [1] \u2192 [2,3,4,5,1], which is incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests a flaw in the choice of the pivot.\n\nHmm, where have I gone wrong?\n\nThe issue arises because when the pivot is the smallest element (like 1 in [5,4,3,2,1]), the left is all larger elements, and when those are sorted, and then we append the pivot 1 at the end, which would place it after the larger elements. But in reality, the pivot is the smallest, so it should come before the left part.\n\nWait, no. So perhaps the way the elements are being split is wrong.\n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because when the pivot is selected as the last element, perhaps I should process the left and right differently. Let me reevaluate the logic.\n\nIn the code, I have:\n\nleft = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\nmiddle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\nright = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\n\nAnd then returns quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right).\n\nWhich in the case where pivot is 1, the left is [5,4,3,2], which gets sorted into [2,3,4,5], then appends [1], resulting in [2,3,4,5,1] instead of [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nWait, that's incorrect because [2,3,4,5] comes before [1].\n\nSo the issue is that the algorithm is returning sorted(left) + middle + sorted(right), but in this case, left is larger than middle, so sorted(left) should come after.\n\nWait, no. That doesn't make sense. Because in the function, pivot is the element around which the array is being split. So elements in left are less than pivot, and elements in right are greater.\n\nWait, no, in the code as written, left is elements < pivot, but when I process them, they are sorted, so in the [5,4,3,2,1] case, the left is [5,4,3,2], which are all greater than 1. But in reality, all these elements are greater than the pivot 1. So the code mistakenly puts them in the left, which is for elements less than the pivot, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's the problem. Because the code is selecting elements less than the pivot and putting them in the left, but when the pivot is 1, all the elements except itself are greater than 1, so the left should have 0 elements, and the right should have all the other elements. Wait, but the code is currently including them in the left.\n\nAh, now I see the mistake.\n\nBecause in this example, [5,4,3,2,1], the last element is 1, so pivot is 1. The code then builds 'left' by taking elements from the array except the last (so [5,4,3,2]) that are less than 1. None are, so left is empty. Then 'right' is all elements except the last that are greater than 1, which is [5,4,3,2]. So right is [5,4,3,2]. So when the function returns quicksort(left) (which is []) + middle [1] + quicksort(right).\n\nNow, quicksort(right) processes [5,4,3,2], and as we saw earlier, returns [2,3,4,5]. So the final result is [] + [1] + [2,3,4,5] \u2192 [1,2,3,4,5], which is correct.\n\nWait, that is different from what I thought earlier. So why in the earlier analysis did the code produce incorrect results? Because I must have miscalculated.\n\nLet me re-examine the [5,4,3,2,1] example.\n\narr = [5,4,3,2,1]\n\nlen(arr) is 5, which is >1. pivot = arr[-1] =1.\n\nleft is [x for x in [5,4,3,2] if x <1 \u2192 no elements, left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [x for x in arr if x ==1 \u2192 [1].\n\nright is [x for x in [5,4,3,2] if x>1 \u2192 all elements, so right is [5,4,3,2].\n\nCall quicksort(right) on [5,4,3,2].\n\nIn that function call:\n\npivot is 2.\n\nleft is [x for x in [5,4,3] if x<2 \u2192 only elements less than 2, which none. So left = empty.\n\nmiddle is [2].\n\nright is [x for x in [5,4,3] if x>2 \u2192 5,4,3.\n\nCall quicksort(right) on [5,4,3].\n\npivot is 3.\n\nleft for this call is [x for x in [5,4] if x <3 \u2192 which is none, so left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [3].\n\nright is [x for x in [5,4] if x>3 \u2192 5,4.\n\nCall quicksort([5,4]).\n\npivot is 4.\n\nleft is [x for x in [5] if x <4 \u2192 no element, left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [4].\n\nright is [x for x in [5] if x>4 \u2192 5.\n\nCall quicksort([5]) \u2192 returns [5].\n\nSo in the quicksort([5,4]) call, left is empty, right returns [5], so quicksort([5,4]) is quicksort(left) () + [4] + quicksort(right) ([5]) \u2192 [4,5].\n\nThen, in the quicksort([5,4,3]) call, right is [5,4], which returns [4,5]. So the result is quicksort(left) (empty) + [3] + [4,5] \u2192 [3,4,5].\n\nBack to the call quicksort([5,4,3,2]), the right was [5,4,3], which is now processed into [3,4,5].\n\nSo then quicksort([5,4,3,2]) returns quicksort(left) (empty) + [2] + [3,4,5] \u2192 [2,3,4,5].\n\nThen, in the original function call, quicksort([5,4,3,2,1]) returns quicksort(left) (empty) \u2192 [] + [1] + [2,3,4,5] \u2192 [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nSo why did I think earlier that it was returning [2,3,4,5,1]? Because I made a mistake in the earlier analysis, not correctly handling that the left in the initial call is empty, not containing any elements.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct after all.\n\nLet me test another scenario: [3,6,8,10,1,2,1].\n\nIn the sample, the output should be [1,1,2,3,6,8,10].\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe array is [3,6,8,10,1,2,1].\n\npivot is last element 1.\n\nleft = [3,6,8,10,1,2] where x <1 \u2192 1 and 2 are not less than 1. The 1's are equal. So left is empty.\n\nmiddle is all elements equal to 1: so [1] and the others 1s, in this case, two 1's.\n\nWait, no. Original array [3,6,8,10,1,2,1] has two 1's. So middle will be [1,1].\n\nright = [3,6,8,10,1,2] where x>1 \u2192 3,6,8,10,2.\n\nWait, 3>1: yes. 6 yes. 8 yes. 10 yes. 1 is no. 2 is yes.\n\nSo right is [3,6,8,10,2].\n\nSo the code would return quicksort(empty) + [1,1] + quicksort([3,6,8,10,2]).\n\nNow, let's process [3,6,8,10,2].\n\npivot is 2.\n\nleft is [3,6,8,10] where x <2 \u2192 none (3 and above are all >2. So left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [2].\n\nright is [3,6,8,10] where x>2 \u2192 all, so [3,6,8,10].\n\nCall quicksort([3,6,8,10]).\n\npivot is 10.\n\nleft is [3,6,8], where x<10 \u2192 yes, so [3,6,8].\n\nmiddle is [10].\n\nright is empty.\n\nCall quicksort([3,6,8]).\n\npivot is 8.\n\nleft is [3,6] where x<8 \u2192 yes, [3,6].\n\nmiddle [8].\n\nright is empty.\n\nCall quicksort([3,6]).\n\npivot is 6.\n\nleft is [3] \u2192 yes, [3].\n\nmiddle [6].\n\nright is empty.\n\nCall quicksort([3]) \u2192 returns [3].\n\nSo quicksort([3,6]) is [3] + [6] \u2192 [3,6].\n\nThen, quicksort([3,6,8]) is quicksort([3,6]) + [8] \u2192 [3,6,8].\n\nThen, quicksort([3,6,8,10]) is [3,6,8] + [10] \u2192 [3,6,8,10].\n\nBack to the [3,6,8,10,2] call, the function returns quicksort(left) (empty) + [2] + quicksort([3,6,8,10]) \u2192 [2,3,6,8,10].\n\nSo in the [3,6,8,10,2] call, the result is [2,3,6,8,10].\n\nThen, back to the original function call, quicksort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1]) returns [] + [1,1] + [2,3,6,8,10] \u2192 [1,1,2,3,6,8,10], which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct after all. Earlier mistake was a miscalculation on my part.\n\nNow, let's think about other test cases, like when the array is already sorted in reverse order. Or when there are multiple duplicates.\n\nAnother test case could be [2,1,3,2,2,5].\n\nBut according to the code, it should process correctly.\n\nThus, perhaps the code is correct.\n\nWait, but what about when the array has even number of elements and the middle index? Let's see:\n\nFor arr = [4,2], the code chooses 2 as pivot. left is [4 (no, because x <2? No, 4>2. So left is empty.\n\nmiddle is [2].\n\nright is [4].\n\nSo quicksort(right): [4] \u2192 process as len 1, returns [4].\n\nSo the result is empty + [2] + [4] \u2192 [2,4], correct.\n\nAnother example: [4,2,4,8,3,2] \u2192 which we saw earlier.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the implementation can proceed as described: select the last element as pivot, split into left (elements < pivot), middle (elements == pivot), right (elements> pivot), then recursively quicksort left and right, concatenate the results.\n\nSo I can write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo implement the quicksort algorithm for sorting a list of integers in ascending order, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Base Case Handling**: If the list is empty or has a single element, it is already sorted, so return the list as is.\n\n2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose the last element of the list as the pivot. This helps simplify the partitioning process.\n\n3. **Partitioning**: Divide the list into three sublists:\n   - `left`: Elements less than the pivot.\n   - `middle`: Elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `right`: Elements greater than the pivot.\n\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply quicksort to the `left` and `right` sublists.\n\n5. **Combine Results**: Concatenate the sorted `left` sublist, the `middle` sublist, and the sorted `right` sublist to form the final sorted list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the list is divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved recursively, leading to an overall sorted list.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef quicksort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[-1]\n    left = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Base Case**: The function immediately returns the list if it's empty or contains a single element since no sorting is needed.\n  \n- **Pivot Selection**: The last element is chosen as the pivot to simplify partitioning. This choice doesn't affect the correctness but can influence performance based on the dataset.\n\n- **Partitioning**: The list is split into three parts based on comparison with the pivot. This ensures that elements less than the pivot go to the left, equal elements go to the middle, and greater elements go to the right.\n\n- **Recursive Sorting**: The function recursively sorts the `left` and `right` sublists, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\n- **Combining Results**: The sorted sublists and the middle part are concatenated to form the final sorted list, ensuring all elements are in ascending order.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles various cases, including lists with duplicates and reverse-sorted lists, ensuring correct and optimal sorting using the quicksort algorithm.",
