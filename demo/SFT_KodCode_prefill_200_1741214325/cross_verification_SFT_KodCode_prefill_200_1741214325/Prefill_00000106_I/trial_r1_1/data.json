  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function for insertion sort. I've heard about insertion sort before, but I'm not exactly sure how it works. Let me think. From what I remember, insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each item into its correct position.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The idea is similar to how you sort playing cards in your hands. You start with the first card, then take the next one and insert it into the correct spot in the already sorted part of the list. You keep doing this until all cards are sorted.\n\nSo, in terms of a list, the algorithm should work like this: for each element in the list starting from the second one, you compare it with the elements before it and find the right place to insert it. This way, a portion of the list is always sorted, and you expand this sorted portion by adding one element at a time.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Take the list as input.\n2. Iterate through each element starting from index 1 (since the first element is already sorted).\n3. For each element, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion of the list and find its correct position.\n4. Shift the elements in the sorted portion to make space for the current element.\n5. Insert the current element into the correct position.\n\nHmm, but how do I implement this in Python? I think I'll need nested loops. The outer loop will iterate through each element of the list starting from index 1. The inner loop will handle the comparison and shifting process.\n\nWait, let's think about the inner loop. For each key (current element), I need to compare it with the previous elements. If the key is smaller than the element before it, I shift that element to the right. I continue this until I find a position where the key is larger or equal, then I insert it there.\n\nLet me try to sketch some pseudocode:\n\nfunction insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i from 1 to len(arr):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\nDoes that make sense? I think so. The outer loop starts at 1 and goes to the end. The key is the current element to be inserted. The inner loop moves backward through the sorted part, comparing and shifting until the correct spot is found.\n\nWait, in the inner loop, j starts at i-1. Then, as long as j is >=0 and the key is smaller than arr[j], we shift arr[j] to arr[j+1], so the key can be placed at j+1 after the loop ends.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So in the code, I'll have two loops: one for each element and one for shifting.\n\nNow, to write this in Python. The function will take a list as input. I'll loop from 1 to len(arr), inclusive or exclusive? Well, in Python, range is exclusive of the end, so I'll use range(1, len(arr)) because for i in range(1, len(arr)), i goes from 1 to len(arr)-1, which is correct since indexing starts at 0.\n\nThen, for each i, assign key = arr[i], then j = i -1. Then while j >=0 and key < arr[j], do arr[j+1] = arr[j], and decrement j. Once the loop exits, assign arr[j+1] = key.\n\nYes, that should do it. Let me test this logic with a sample list, say [5, 3, 8, 4, 2].\n\nFirst iteration, i=1, key=3. j=0. arr[j]=5 >3, so shift arr[1] to 5. Now arr is [5,5,8,4,2]. Wait, no, wait. No, the inner loop runs while j >=0 and key < arr[j]. So for i=1, j=0, key=3 <5. So arr[j+1]=arr[j], which is arr[1] becomes 5. j becomes -1, then arr[j+1] = key, which is arr[0]=3. So now the list is [3,5,8,4,2]. That's correct.\n\nNext i=2, key=8. j=1. arr[j]=5 <8, so no shift. So j remains 1, insert at j+1=2. So nothing changes for this key.\n\ni=3, key=4. j=2, arr[j]=8>4. So shift arr[j] to the right, arr[3]=8. Now j=1, compare 4 with arr[1]=5. 4<5, so shift to arr[2]=5. Now j=0, arr[0]=3 <4. So we stop. Insert key at j+1=1. So list becomes [3,4,5,8,2].\n\nWait, no. Let me step through:\n\ni=3, key=4. j=2 (since i=3, j=2). arr[j]=8>4, so shift: arr[j+1] =8, so arr[3]=8, then j=1.\n\nNow, j=1, arr[j]=5>4: shift arr[2]=5, j=0.\n\narr[j]=3 <4: so the loop exits. Now j=0, insert at j+1=1. So arr[1]=4. So the list is now [3,4,5,8,2].\n\nThen i=4, key=2. j=3, arr[3]=8>2: shift to arr[4]=8.\n\nj=2, arr[2]=5>2: shift to arr[3]=5.\n\nj=1, arr[1]=4>2: shift to arr[2]=4.\n\nj=0, arr[0]=3>2: shift to arr[1]=3.\n\nNow j=-1, loop ends. Insert at j+1=0: arr[0]=2. So list becomes [2,3,4,5,8].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, I'll translate this into Python, adding detailed comments explaining each part, as the user requested.\n\nI'll also make sure the function is well-documented, including a docstring explaining what it does, the input, output, and time complexity.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will modify the list in place, but return it as well. Alternatively, it could return a new list, but in this case, since we're sorting in place, we can just return the sorted list.\n\nI think that's all. Now, let me write the code with comments.\n</think>\n\nTo implement the insertion sort algorithm in Python, follow these steps. Insertion sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time, inserting each element into its correct position within the previously sorted portion of the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with an unsorted list of integers.\n2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each element of the list starting from the second element (index 1). This element is referred to as the \"key.\"\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each key, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion of the list (elements before the current key). Move backward through this sorted portion, shifting elements to the right until the correct position for the key is found.\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position is found, insert the key into that position.\n5. **Completion**: Continue this process until all elements are sorted.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a list of integers using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The list of integers to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Iterate through each element starting from the second element (index 1)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]  # Current element to be inserted into the sorted portion\n        j = i - 1     # Initialize index for the sorted portion\n\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]  # Shift the element to the right\n            j -= 1               # Move to the previous element in the sorted portion\n\n        arr[j + 1] = key  # Insert the key into its correct position\n\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function takes a list `arr` as input and initializes the sorting process.\n- **Outer Loop**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(arr))` iterates over each element starting from the second element.\n- **Key and Index Setup**: For each iteration, the current element `arr[i]` is stored as `key`. The index `j` is initialized to `i-1` to start comparing from the previous element.\n- **Inner Loop**: The `while` loop compares `key` with elements in the sorted portion. If `key` is smaller, the elements are shifted to the right, and `j` is decremented.\n- **Insertion**: After the correct position is found, `key` is placed at `arr[j + 1]`.\n- **Return**: The sorted list is returned after all elements have been processed.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element is inserted into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array, resulting in a fully sorted list by the end of the iterations.",
