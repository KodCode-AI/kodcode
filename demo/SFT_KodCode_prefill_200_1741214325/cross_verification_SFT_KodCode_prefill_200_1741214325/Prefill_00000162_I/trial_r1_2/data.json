  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a Python function that filters out all even numbers from a list. The list can have both positive and negative integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that even numbers are those divisible by 2. So whether a number is positive or negative doesn't matter because when you divide by 2, the remainder determines evenness. \n\nWait, right. For example, -4 divided by 2 is -2 with no remainder, so it's even. Similarly, 6 is even. So, the function needs to go through each number in the list, check if it's even, and exclude it from the resulting list.\n\nSo, the function should take a list as input. Then, iterate over each element in the list. For each element, check if it's even. If it is, don't include it; if it's not, include it in the new list.\n\nHow to check if a number is even? I can use the modulus operator. If num % 2 equals 0, it's even. So for each number in the input list, I'll apply this condition.\n\nWait, but what about zero? Well, zero is an even number because 0 divided by 2 is 0 with no remainder. So zero should be filtered out as well.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Define a function that takes a list as an argument.\n2. Initialize an empty list to hold the filtered numbers.\n3. Loop through each number in the input list.\n4. For each number, check if it's even using num % 2 != 0. Wait, no. Because if num % 2 is 0, it's even, so we don't include it. So actually, we should include numbers where num % 2 is not zero.\n5. Wait, yes. So, the condition is if num % 2 != 0: include in the new list.\n6. Append those numbers to the new list.\n7. After processing all numbers, return the new list.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a list comprehension to make it more concise. The list comprehension would iterate through each number and include it only if it's odd.\n\nSo, the function could be written as:\n\ndef filter_even_numbers(num_list):\n    return [num for num in num_list if num % 2 != 0]\n\nWait, but wait. What about if the list is empty? Well, the function will just return an empty list, which is correct.\n\nLet me test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput list: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nFunction should return [1, 3]\n\nExample 2:\nInput list: [-2, -4, -6]\nFunction will check each number:\n-2 % 2 is 0, so it's even and excluded.\nSame for -4, -6. So output is empty list.\n\nExample 3:\nInput list: [0, 5, -3]\n0 is even, so it's excluded. 5 is odd, included. -3 is odd, included. So output is [5, -3].\n\nYes, this logic works.\n\nI think this should handle all cases, positive, negative, and zero.\n</think>\n\nTo filter out all even numbers from a list containing both positive and negative integers, we'll create a function that returns a new list with only the odd numbers. Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Define the function**: The function will take a list of integers as input.\n2. **Use list comprehension**: Iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, check if it's odd by using the condition `num % 2 != 0`.\n3. **Return the new list**: Collect all numbers that meet the odd condition and return them as the result.\n\nHere's the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(num_list):\n    return [num for num in num_list if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, -2, -3, 0]\nfiltered_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)\nprint(filtered_numbers)  # Output: [1, 3, -3]\n```\n\nThis function efficiently processes each number and returns the desired filtered list.",
