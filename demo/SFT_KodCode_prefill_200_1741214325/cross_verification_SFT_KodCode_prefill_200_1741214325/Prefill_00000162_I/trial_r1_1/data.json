  "r1_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to write a Python function that filters out all the even numbers from a list, and it should handle both positive and negative integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, to check if a number is even, you use the modulus operator. If a number modulo 2 equals zero, it's even. So for each number in the list, I can apply this condition.\n\nWait, but I want to exclude the even numbers. So I need to create a new list that includes only the numbers that are not even, which means numbers where number % 2 is not equal to zero.\n\nSo the function will take a list as input. I can iterate over each element in this list using a loop or a list comprehension. Oh, list comprehensions are more efficient and readable, so maybe I'll go with that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Define a function that takes one argument, which is the list of integers.\n2. Inside the function, create a new list that includes only the numbers that are odd. To do this, loop through each number in the input list and include it in the new list if number % 2 != 0.\n3. Return the new list.\n\nBut wait, what about zero? Zero is even, right? So if the list includes zero, it should be excluded. So the condition still holds because 0 % 2 is 0, which makes the condition false, and zero won't be included in the output list. That's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the list contains non-integer values, like strings or floats? The function's description says it handles both positive and negative integers, so perhaps we can assume the input list contains only integers. But if not, applying % 2 to non-integers might cause an error. But since the problem says the function is intended for integers, maybe we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, let's think about the implementation. Using a list comprehension would be straightforward.\n\nSample code outline:\n\ndef filter_even_numbers(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n\nWait, but wait: negative numbers. Let me test: for example, -2 is even. So when you do -2 % 2, it's 0, so the condition num % 2 != 0 would be False, so -2 is excluded, which is correct. Similarly, -3 % 2 is 1, so it's included. So yes, it works for negatives.\n\nTesting this logic:\n\nList = [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]\nAfter filtering, should return [1, -3, -5]\n\nYes, because 2,4,6 are even and would be excluded.\n\nSo that seems to handle both cases.\n\nI think that should solve the problem. The function is concise and covers all the cases mentioned.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that filters out all even numbers from a given list of integers. The function should handle both positive and negative integers efficiently.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: We need a function that takes a list of integers (both positive and negative) and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. Even numbers, including zero, should be excluded from the result.\n\n2. **Identify the Condition for Odd Numbers**: A number is considered odd if it does not divide evenly by 2. This can be checked using the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2` equals 1, the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.\n\n3. **Use List Comprehension**: List comprehensions in Python provide a concise and efficient way to create new lists by iterating over each element of the input list and applying a condition. This allows us to filter out even numbers succinctly.\n\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: The solution naturally handles negative integers since the modulus operation works correctly for negative values, ensuring that they are included or excluded based on their parity.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef filter_even_numbers(lst):\n    return [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `filter_even_numbers` takes one parameter `lst`, which is the list of integers to be filtered.\n- **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `lst`.\n- **Condition for Odd Numbers**: The condition `num % 2 != 0` checks if a number is odd. If this condition is true, the number is included in the new list.\n- **Return Value**: The resulting list, which contains only the odd numbers from the input list, is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and easy to understand, handling all specified cases correctly.",
