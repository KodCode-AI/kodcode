# üê± KodCode: A Diverse, Challenging, and Verifiable Synthetic Dataset for Coding

KodCode is the largest fully-synthetic open-source dataset providing verifiable solutions and tests for coding tasks. It contains 12 distinct subsets spanning various domains (from algorithmic to package-specific knowledge) and difficulty levels (from basic coding exercises to interview and competitive programming challenges). KodCode is designed for both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL tuning.

## Overview
![KodCode](https://kodcode-ai.github.io/static/images/kodcode-pipeline.jpg)

## Features
KodCode is a comprehensive pipeline designed to generate diverse, challenging, and verifiable synthetic datasets for coding tasks. Key features include:
- **Diverse Sources:** Generate high-quality coding questions from multiple sources including zero-shot generation, human-written assessment questions, code snippets, and technical documentation - **all unified in a single framework!**
- **Self-Verification:** Generate verifiable solutions and tests for each coding question. Support pytest and parallel execution.
- **Style Converter:** Easy to convert between different styles of coding questions.

## Installation

**Build environment**

Conda Environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/KodCode-AI/kodcode.git
cd kodcode
conda create -n kodcode python=3.10 -y
conda activate kodcode
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run unit tests in parallel, you also need to install `parallel`. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install `parallel` by:
```
sudo apt-get install parallel
```

## Generate KodCode

Please refer to the [pipeline](https://github.com/KodCode-AI/kodcode/blob/main/pipeline) for more details.

##  TODO

### Repo Update
- [ ] One-line command to generate KodCode
- [ ] Integrate the test pipeline (i.e., `pytest`) into [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)
- [ ] Implement sandbox execution for unit tests

### Data Update
- [ ] `KodCode-Small` with 50K samples
- [ ] `KodCode-V1.1`: Support `stdin` format with ~150K additional samples
