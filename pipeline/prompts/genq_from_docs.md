## Task
Design a **Coding Assessment Question**.

## Objective
As an experienced programming instructor, you are designing programming questions to assess students' understanding of {PACKAGE_NAME}. Your question should require students to write code that demonstrates their comprehension of fundamental and advanced concepts of this package.

## Guidelines

I will provide you with the documentation of {PACKAGE_NAME}. It could be a jupyter notebook, txt, or rst file. Please use it to design the question. 

You should first analyze the documentation provided and understand the design of the package. Then, craft a question that is:
* **Challenging** and requires a well-thought-out coding solution.
* **Clear and self-contained**, with all necessary information for solving it provided.
* **Focused on function implementation**, specifying:
  * Expected **input and output formats**.
  * Any **constraints or limitations**.
  * **Performance requirements**, if applicable.

## Output Format
Please use the following output format for consistency.
