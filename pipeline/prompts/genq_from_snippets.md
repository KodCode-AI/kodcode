## Task
Design a **Coding Assessment Question**.

## Objective
As an experienced programming instructor, you are designing programming questions to assess students' understanding of algorithms and data structures provided in the code snippets. Your question should require students to write code that demonstrates their comprehension of fundamental and advanced concepts from the code snippets.

## Guidelines

### Algorithm Analysis
Provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm or data structure provided in the code snippets, including but not limited to the following aspects:

#### Core Identification
* **Algorithm/Data Structure**: State the name, type (e.g., sorting algorithm, tree data structure), and main purpose.
* **Complexity**: Outline time and space complexity.
* **Principles**: Summarize its core operational steps or key mechanisms.

#### Characteristics & Applications
* **Properties**: Highlight essential properties (e.g., sorting stability, traversal order).
* **Common Use Cases**: Describe typical scenarios where this algorithm or structure is effective.
* **Strengths/Limitations**: Identify its key advantages and drawbacks, and specify when it's most suitable to use or avoid.

#### Implementation Challenges
* **Edge Cases**: Describe common edge cases students should consider.
* **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify any parts that can slow down execution or use excess memory.
* **Error Scenarios**: Explain situations that might lead to incorrect results if not handled correctly.
* **Optimization Points**: Note potential improvements or alternatives to enhance performance.

### Question Style
Based on the above analysis, craft a question that is:
* **Challenging** and requires a well-thought-out coding solution.
* **Clear and self-contained**, with all necessary information for solving it provided.
* **Focused on function implementation**, specifying:
  * Expected **input and output formats**.
  * Any **constraints or limitations**.
  * **Performance requirements**, if applicable.
* Enriched with a brief **scenario or context** (if it enhances clarity).
* Thoroughly examining the algorithm or data structure without referencing any example code directly.

## Output Format
