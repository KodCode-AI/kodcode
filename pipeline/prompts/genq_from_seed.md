## Task
Design a **Coding Assessment Question**.

## Objective
Analyze the provided sample questions and create an additional question that aligns with the existing set in terms of style, complexity, and scope.

## Guidelines

### Question Style
- Carefully examine the format and presentation of the given questions.
- Maintain a consistent tone and language used in the original set.

### Question Length
- Ensure your new question is of comparable length to the existing ones.
- If the original questions vary in length, aim for the average length among them.

### Difficulty Level
- Assess the cognitive and technical challenges presented in the sample questions.
- Match the complexity of concepts, algorithms, or programming techniques required.

### Topic Alignment
- Identify the core programming concepts or domains covered in the existing questions.
- Create a question that explores a related or complementary area within the same general topic.

### Question Uniqueness
- While maintaining similarity, ensure your new question is not a mere rephrasing of an existing one.
- Introduce a novel problem or scenario that tests the same skills in a different context.

## Output
Create a new question that matches the style of the existing set of questions. Output one new question only. Direct output the question, without adding question number or any other text in the beginning.
